i made a dress out of target bags,Ellie F. '28,2,2025-09-21T00:00:00-04:00,"Hey yall. It’s been a while.

On Sunday June 21st I texted Ceri that I was planning on dropping an effortpost “in the next week or so”. (:

It has now been over two weeks now since Silksong dropped. I have no explanation, only excuses. When I started this project I had big dreams, but now I have big psets.

For the past two Tuesdays, the 10pm-11pm time slot on my Google Calendar has been blocked out to finish my Target blog and it didn’t happen either of those times. I feel like I have no time at all or maybe negative time but I still somehow have this stubborn belief that I can do big fun things that contribute nothing towards my to-do list. Life finds a way, I guess.

Anyways here’s the vlog <3

Details:

I filmed this with my phone, balanced precariously on the edges of various boxes and tables. I edited it in Adobe Premiere Pro which I get free with my tuition. Most of the voiceover was recorded in one take, somehow. I got most of the bags from the Target in Central Square, as well as one or two from Alpha Delta Phi’s reusable bag rack. All of the sewing supplies were from MAD, with the exception of the red thread I was hand-sewing with, which I pilfered from Math Prize for Girls 2024.

Shout out to Tor’s Cabinet of Curiosities, which I watched a lot of while sewing. One day I’m gonna get rich and make my own better version of the Georgia Guidestones. Thank you to Ceri for believing in me always. Thank you to Trader Joe’s which was three minutes from my house and supplied me all the snacks I needed to get through this. And thank you to the Academy.

See you next effortpost.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-zuz_nZhGY,1
i became british for a summer,Anika H. '26,3,2025-09-18T00:00:00-04:00,"I worked in Bristol Robotics this summer through MISTI, MIT’s travel abroad program. I figured this could be fun, getting to work somewhere cool and also play tourist on the weekend in another country, but even the internship alone was by far the best work/research experience I’ve had. I met wonderful people that I’m still friends with and was genuinely excited about the research enough that I continued working on it (at least for now before I get hosed) after the internship ended. Over the summer, we made a human-hand-sized robotic hand with touch sensing.

 

cool people!

Part of what I liked so much about the job was that I got to see and help with so many other projects and assistive tech. One grad student was working on a robot that could perform manual labor tasks, and I helped her paint an imaginary wall for half an hour as she collected data on arm movements. Jebby helped with a group designing a smart walker with crash detection and voice activation. I think Maddie, the other MISTI student from my group, got the coolest gig of walking around in a space suit with a pneumatic exoskeleton as they logged movement data.

I worked in the Dextrous Robotics group. My direct supervisor was technically Nathan, but because his schedule was packed so full it practically overflowed, we only saw him once or twice a week when we had group meetings. When he was here though, he would ask so many good questions it made up for him never being around. He seems to be popular around the lab (there are 3D prints of his head on some desks). When I had questions, I usually went to annoy Chris. He had his own projects to work on so I tried not to bother him too much, but when I inevitably needed clarification on something, he would pause mid-task to help me unless he was in the middle of a meeting.

Our group didn’t usually hang out during lunch, so when I saw Jebby with a bunch of people on her first day at work, I went “ooh, new friends!” And snuck my way into their group under the pretense of also wanting to help do the daily crossword puzzles.

the usual suspects at lunch

When I first met them, I did the very American thing of “Hi! My name is Anika and here are all my hobbies and interests” from force of habit, despite the MISTI culture training sessions. I also tried to stop myself from yapping too much, though that eventually got easier as I had slightly less to say after the first month or so.

:|

One of the best parts of the internship were all the people here, who were all effortlessly cool, funny, well traveled, or insanely cracked at the research they do, or some combination of all of these things. Unlike the US, there’s no social pressure to talk in the UK. You can just vibe with the group and they’ll be totally fine with just having your presence around, but the more I hung around, the more I wanted to get to know them better. Fortunately for me, they didn’t seem to mind if I talked either (until I got comfortable enough to pull out my terrible terrible British accent).

cool people

We went out to the pub together a few times to hang out and get drinks. We yapped about stupid things for 4 hours straight, and raved about the hot nuts they sold. You could get a cup full of “spicy” crunchy peanuts for 2.50 pounds and it was worth every pence. Right before our internships ended, Yash, Jebby, and I went to see Superman together and walked around the city until late in the night. By the end of the summer, I made some incredible friends.

 

Incoming Nerd Dump!!!!!

electronics

Because I was the one electrical engineer out of three other mechanical engineers working on the project, I got the really fun task of designing the fingertip and electronics that were meant to fit inside it. The main challenge was that everything had to fit into less than 4 cubic centimeters. This meant that the circuit ended up being the easy part and the layout was an absolute pain. Between the USB-C port, an FPC connector for the camera, another one for the LEDs, and the smallest ESP32 I could find (an ESP32-S3-PICO), I crammed it onto a two layer PCB that I couldn’t physically shrink any more than I already had.

teeny little board

While initially thought it was a great idea because everything fit neatly on the back of the fingertip, it soon came back to bite me in the behind when I realized I had to solder everything on by hand. If we ordered the board preassembled, I would have left before it even arrived, leaving no time to test it, which meant we ordered the parts and the PCB separately. I thought I was good at PCB assembly before I experienced the pain of having to nudge ten different 0402 packages onto their pads with a pair of tweezers and a soldering iron after forgetting to turn down the airflow on the heat gun. For context, rolling one of those around between your fingers feels like having a literal grain of sand. I still believe every EE should have to assemble a PCB by hand and deal with 0402s at least once. It builds character. >:)

The worst part, however, was the 6mm by 6mm ESP32 package. Since the pads were on the bottom of the chip and inaccessible from the side, I stenciled on the solder paste, dropped the chip on as squarely as I could, hot plated the board (or heatgunned if I decided to take off and replace the chip entirely), and prayed to the EE gods that I wouldn’t have to reflow it another 10 times to get the contacts to touch correctly. If you couldn’t guess already, I had to do just that during testing anyways. The technicians ended up helping a lot with my mishaps.

step 1: glue together grains of sand with hot metal.  step 2: crash out. (Shoutout to Simon, Tom#2, and Jason for helping me not die from SMT soldering.)

I’m very happy I got to keep my stupid little board because after the amount of effort I put into it, I started developing some amount of emotional attachment to it. And despite how much frustration went into its creation, the hands on part the last week was probably some of the most fun I had.

 

CADding it up

Before the internship, I knew enough CAD to get around and make most simple things, but practice makes better and boy did I get a lot of practice. After spending half the summer fighting Fusion 360 and getting ragebaited by the sheer number of times it crashed near the end, I am now way better at Fusion 360 than Solidworks and Onshape, the two programs I used before.

a regular day

They had a multimaterial 3D printer which I used a lot for prototyping the housing of the fingertip. On the second print, I ran into an issue where the clear acrylic was printing opaque. After bug-hunting in futility for some time, I relented and went to the technicians for help. It was not the accidental slot I made near the base or even the slightly asymmetrical filets on the left and right side, but the little “texture override” button that I forgot to click.

When I finished the main fingertip and was still waiting for the boards and components to arrive, I started making an alternate version designed to have a more textured pad for better grip. It turned out pretty cool looking, but I haven’t really had the chance to test it yet.

 

adventuring

Because I couldn’t comfortably last a summer without fire, I spent a month looking and found a local firespinning group. We’d spin together every two or three weeks in the evenings, usually in Eastville Park, which was quite fun because the fastest way to get there from my apartment was to hike through a little path in the woods.

The firespinners here are as weird as me and my friends back home, also rocking dyed hair and picking wild blackberries as snacks on the way to work. People were friendly and there was always someone new at the fire jams. I brought a pair of poi, which I didn’t spin too much of before the summer, and learned a ton of new tricks from people. I met someone I watched online tutorials from, professionals who spin fire full time, crafters who made their own custom props, and so many other incredible people.

I traveled a lot on the weekends with Jebby. We played tourist on Saturdays and spent most of Sunday sleeping in and lounging around.

We museum-maxxed for most cities we visited, going to multiple art museums, natural history museums, local history museums, and the very famous one where the British stole everyone’s stuff (tbf, it was quite cool to look at).

One of the parts I liked the most were the amount of green spaces there were, at least in the area I was living in. I could walk 15 minutes in one direction and get to a massive park or walk 20 minutes in another direction and get to an even more massive park. There were little paths under roads and between houses everywhere and if felt like any of these shortcuts could have landed me in Narnia.

We went punting in Oxford! The streams in the area are quite shallow, which means you can take long pole and push off the bottom of the river to go forward. It was a bit of a learning curve and really hard to steer (we were crashing into the river bank every 20 feet), so I fully gave up and started using the long pole like a two sided paddle. We looked ridiculous, but our boat was going twice as fast as everyone else on the river. Just as we turned around to head back, we achieved the complete tourist experience of getting flirted at by a group of college-age-looking dudes while looking like complete idiots.

The last week after our internship, we got to do basically anything we wanted, so we went to the Jurassic Coast to go fossil hunting. Once we got to the part of the beach with dark stick oxford clay, we found some fragments. Our haul at the end was one piece of a fossilized clam shell, and about eight or so fragments of tube worms.

I’m happy to be back at school now though! I missed all my friends and can finally fulfill my need to pet cats every day.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uk-24-800x600.jpg

3 Simple Steps for Making New Friends,Victor D. '27,4,2025-09-17T00:00:00-04:00,"“You can do whatever you want—well, maybe not anything you want. But you can come and go. You can do anything and you don’t have to do anything.” – Maria Kalman

My heart was nearly jumping out of my chest when I entered the MIT admissions office for the first time during 
        Sin Limite.
      
 Nervous was an understatement: I felt like I was shutting down. After checking in and dropping my bags in a sea of other bags, I was ushered into a room with the other Sin Limite attendees. I had arrived a bit late, and it seemed like everyone in the room 
        already knew somebody.
      
 I knew nobody: I was the only admit from my high school. I grabbed some snacks from the plastic, gray foldable table at the center of the room, and quietly slid to the edge of the room. Paradoxically, I was desperate to be and not to be noticed: maybe somebody would come make it look like I belonged here by talking to me, while I also wished to be as invisible as possible, fearing I looked strange for hovering over the room…

I’m currently reading “On Looking,” a book where author Alexandra Horowitz goes on urban walks with people of 
        various professions, identities, and conditions,
      
 to highlight how our expertise and life experience impacts our perspective. Her walk with illustrator Maria Kalman was particularly salient to me. Horowitz writes how she was struck by how effortlessly Kalman floated between spaces and people, whether that was a church or a senior center. Horowitz describes Kalman’s approach to navigating the city as: “Take a left where you ordinarily would take a right, open the gate to the block garden you’ve never visited, view the passerby as a person who is waiting for you to speak to him.” I think it’s also a great set of steps for how to socialize and discover new people.

 

“Take a left where you ordinarily would take a right.”

I used to like to take every elevator and every stairwell in 
        Burton Conner.
      
 Why? Well, otherwise, I wouldn’t run into so many people!

We are creatures of habit. We seek repetition, symmetry, and order;
         our brains even change physically by developing neural pathways that reward repetitive behavior.
      
 In a space like a dormitory, wherein there’s some 6+ ways to get to my room, all of which are efficient, why not vary? Soon, you realize you’re seeing—and interacting with—entirely different spaces and people; you walk up the stairs to take the elevator closest to the 
        Porter Room
      
 when you hear music; apparently, it’s the “Balkan Dance”; and you’re waltzing in. For some reason, your roommate is there… you remember they have a very peculiar fascination for Slovenia, and now you’re meeting tons of new people by helping your roommate talk to various people in the crowd to identify a Slovenian person.

Sometimes, I would take the 
        Conner-side
      
 elevator(s) instead of the Burton one… “Wait, no way, I haven’t seen you in forever! How’s it going?” By the time you reach the 4th floor 
        (which is technically the 5th),
      
 you’ve just reconnected with an old acquaintance and he’s going to share some delicious stir fry he made with you. You’ve never seen him take the Burton-side elevator.

The amount of interactions I’ve had outside BC that begin like, “I feel like I know you from somewhere…” and you both realize you’ve already been pressing “3rd” for them for the past few months because, somehow, you’re already familiar. And this gentle familiarity, despite maybe never having exchanged a word, is ripe for a future connection. By deviating from your usual paths, you’ll be able to circumstantially “meet” those with different dispositions from yours, even if it’s as simple as “I prefer the 
        Outfinite”
      
 or “I prefer this elevator because it’s more square than the others.”

 

“Open the gate to the block garden you’ve never visited.”

One day while studying together in our room during freshman spring, my roommates and I were spooked by a conspicuous knock at the door. I got up to answer; it was a sophomore, living on our floor 
        (B4).
      
 She poked her head into the room,

“Hiii. Can I come in?” She asked, “Can I see your room?”

I’m a bit puzzled; after all, I barely know anything about her beyond her name, her year, and her floor. But what reason do I have to say no? So, I let her in, asking her to take off her shoes at the front.

It’s a bit awkward at first as she slowly gazes around the room, and I’m not really sure what to say (“what’s up?” doesn’t really seem to be going anywhere). After a moment, she excuses herself from the room.

A few days later, I hear a knock again—the same knock as before. This time, she opens the door slightly ajar before asking to come in. We start talking a bit more, getting to know each other: where we’re from, 
        course,
      
 interests…

Some more visits later, and it’s no longer unusual for her to appear in our room. No longer is it awkward and I’m always dying laughing talking to her. Is this a new friend?

So I went to her suite for the first time by myself. I knock and her roommate answers; turns out she wasn’t home. Suddenly though, I’m now talking to her roommate and the next time she comes to our room, her roommate comes with her. Now 2 new friends!

And I realize that all of the rooms with unknown people could all be prompted: to ask to enter. And so throughout my time on B4 and in Burton Conner, I got used to entering a new suite, knocking on a new door, and asking if I could visit. Repeat over and over and before you know it, they might ask “what’s your room number?” Before long, you’re recognizing their approach: their knocks and footsteps. A new friend!!

 

“View the passerby as a person who is waiting for you to speak to him.”

My friend Alex is the definition of extroverted: in the elevator, he asks his typical “What’s your full name?” to every person he does not know in that elevator. At the sandwich shop 
        Sam LaGrassa,
      
 a stranger bumping into his guitar was enough for Alex to ask his name and “what kind of music do you like” before beginning an extensive conversation about MIT mariachi and the stranger’s music taste. And whenever he hears music being played, he can’t help but approach to see who it is, and ask, “Can I jam with you?”

Coming out of 
        Next Dining
      
 one day, we heard sounds emerging from the Next Music Room. I sometimes overthink walking in on people playing music; what if we interrupt them? But he’s already inside before I can even raise this concern and I enter behind him. All 4 strangers in the room are prompted with his usual round of questions I shared above. His first question (albeit coming off somewhat unusual to some people) actually reveals more information than at first glance: 2 of the strangers we identify as Latino, and after Alex shares that I’m Mexican-American, one of the strangers reveals he himself is Mexican. Considering that my friend had visited me in Mexico City when I was there for the summer for 
        MISTI,
      
 this was enough for all of us to “break the ice” and flow into conversation. Before I realize what’s happening, we’re running to BC to grab our instruments to play with this group of strangers we just met. When one of them waves to me in the Infinite some days after, it’s clear they’re no longer strangers, but acquaintances. With a few more chance encounters and maybe some PSET grind sessions with them in Hayden, they too will become friends.

I don’t think I’ll ever be as fearless as Alex but I’ve found myself approaching more strangers than before: walking up to people standing alone at parties just to chat or poking my head into the music room just to complement their playing and say “hi!” These small gestures promote familiarity and sometimes evolve into relationships.

Circling Back to Sin Limite…

“Victor!” I looked up, probably mid-crunch on a crisp, Cool Ranch Dorito, to see someone waving at me. Turns out, he recognized me from a selfie I sent to the ‘27 MIT Discord Server. They kindly invited me to sit with their little group; turns out these people weren’t so scary after all. I had psyched myself out over nothing (well, to the degree that irrational social anxiety is nothing). I imagine if today’s me was in that pre-prefrosh’s shoes, I would’ve approached before being approached. Nothing wrong with being approached, but taking social leaps—which includes putting ourselves in unfamiliar places and situations—lets me be sure I’m not missing out on discovering what awesome shenanigans all the amazing people around me are up to. After all, I wonder how much would we have missed had he not taken the first step to reach out to me?",,0
[Guest Post] Rediscovering en Plein Air Painting,Allison E. '27,5,2025-09-17T00:00:00-04:00,"This post is written by the wonderful Elisa X. ’26 / MEng ’26!

Since I started college, my go-to fun fact when introducing myself is that I enjoy painting & drawing. As the semesters passed at MIT, this fun fact started feeling disingenuous as I strayed further and further away from this hobby. Now as I am starting my fourth year at MIT as a 
        dual senior and MEng student,
      
 only my closest friends really knew I painted in the past, mostly due to the occasional random conversation about art. In fact, funnily enough, I didn’t know my entire friend group had their own side interests in art (digital art, comic design, watercolor, sculpture, etc.) until over a year after we first met.

At MIT, my aim was to maximize my experience. I told myself to expand my horizons and get out of my comfort zone. Over the past three years at MIT, I chased all sorts of side adventures, determined to make the most of my time: co-hosting a radio program, teaching biology in Italy, organizing logistics for MIT Science Olympiad, sailing on the Charles, and even 
        helping a friend with an early-stage startup.
      
 Along the way, I formed core memories too, like spontaneously road-tripping to Vermont for a 
        total solar eclipse
      
 and attending the world figure skating championships in Boston.

While I do not regret doing any of this exploration, in the midst of all these new experiences, I side-tracked away from that comfort zone I once had. The most I did to reconnect with my artistic side was a half-semester Chinese calligraphy course I crammed into my schedule last semester. Ironically, despite my busy workload then, it was one of the classes I dedicated the most time to (due to how relaxing and fun it was), and my skills improved exponentially.

My First Voyage into en Plein Air Painting

I am very fortunate to have taken numerous art classes growing up with supportive teachers who nurtured my budding skills. Although I learned how to use most 2-D art mediums, my favorite was always paints, particularly acrylic due to its versatility in layering and fast drying time. During the beginning of the pandemic in my sophomore year of high school, I would frequently get bored lying around the house all day—so I started taking my full acrylic setup outdoors to paint 
        en plein air,
      
 or in open air in French.

The process of en plein air was quite different from how I approached crafting art pieces in the studio. For these artworks, I would thoroughly plan a compelling narrative along with the composition and colors—then spend dozens of hours refining even the smallest details. For my first few en plein air paintings, I strived to convey the scene perfectly, unable to finish the piece in one sitting. Eventually, with more and more practice, I learned to let go and just capture the essence of the moment.

How I Rediscovered en Plein Air Painting

After years of limited painting, the hardest part was accumulating the activation energy to get started again. Thanks to my summer internship, I finally had something that was quite foreign to an MIT student during the school year: work-life balance. Suddenly, I had so much extra time that I didn’t know what to do with it. I started off mindlessly scrolling on my phone then decided I wanted to do something more meaningful with my time, particularly away from the screen. My CS internship already involved me staring at a screen for hours on end. So on a random evening after work in August, I spontaneously busted out my old watercolor kit from layers of packed storage bags and wandered to the Charles River along Harvard to paint the sunset from life.

Sunset over the CharlesWatercolor, gouache & pen on paper, 2025

En plein air painting was such a stark contrast from my MIT experience. At MIT, I was always in a rush; I self-identify as a meticulous planner, trying to anticipate my next steps months and even years in advance.

With en plein air painting, I couldn’t anticipate my next stroke, let alone predict what the final piece would look like. My only goal was conveying the moment with no concern for precise detail and composition. I simply trusted the process. If it doesn’t work out, no big deal; I’d learn from the experience and move on.

Reflections from my Summer Painting Journey

I set a couple firm rules for myself: 1) no future corrections and 2) no use of tools (e.g. rulers) to capture meticulous detail. As I started, I realized that I never lost any of my past painting skills. Of course, there were some glaring flaws. My initial paintings lacked spatial depth. Also, my colors were slightly inaccurate and the composition somewhat jagged. But I didn’t worry too much about those imperfections, it’s about being in the moment, not chasing perfection. If anything, there’s beauty in imperfections.

This time, I used watercolor (with a touch of white gouache for opacity) instead of my preferred medium of acrylics. Watercolor was the only option I had on hand, which is also much more portable than the full acrylic setup I had back home. Despite watercolor’s beginner-friendly reputation, I believe it’s the hardest painting medium to control. Acrylics allow me to add the smallest details by building up layer after layer, but due to its transparency and slower drying time, watercolor is more stubborn: endless layering, especially on wet paper, 
        can cause colors to look quite muddy.
      


As I painted more this summer, I realized that I am a different artist from my younger self. It’s interesting, given how long of a break I took from painting, but I suppose the ways I’ve grown at MIT unconsciously diffused into my artistic approach. I’m more impatient now but also more relaxed and free. Instead of agonizing over every small detail, I tend to use simpler, more decisive brushstrokes.

Each day I painted, I picked a random location around Boston/Cambridge, typically opting for a somewhat secluded spot with a bench (my basic setup didn’t include an easel so I un-optimally painted on my lap which unfortunately is quite bad for my back). As I painted each scene, I focused on conveying the true colors of a scene that a photograph couldn’t fully capture. Each location had its own challenges from the rapidly changing scene of the fleeting sunset to the textures in the sprawling branches and leaves of the willow tree. I remember each session vividly: the rabbits that occasionally spawned tranquilly eating grass at the Hall’s Pond Sanctuary garden and the sounds of chirping cicadas as the sun quickly set near Harvard.

For one of my latest pieces, I decided to challenge myself by painting the iconic MIT dome with a limited color palette. 
        My limited palette consisted of yellow ochre, alizarin crimson, Prussian blue, and titanium white.
      
 I used a mixture of gouache and watercolor paints, but the addition of white gouache (essentially opaque watercolor) made all the paints act more opaquely. With this palette, I had to be creative with color mixing, careful not to go overboard and create piles of brown mush. And without a ruler, I had to be confident with my linework. Above, I show my full process over the course of approximately 3 hours from drawing a rough sketch, blocking in colors with a large flat brush, adding shadows and contrast with a round brush, 
        then finishing off details with an even smaller round brush.
      


The lines were somewhat tilted, and the shadows weren’t perfect as they did shift significantly as the hours passed by, but I’m quite happy with how I conveyed the iconic scene, especially with its cohesive colors. Ultimately, I felt successful in capturing the feeling of standing in front of the MIT dome, a shared and universal experience for all MIT students.

Recommendations for First-Time en Plein Air Artists

First, don’t think too much about it and just go for it! Even just having a pencil and paper is perfectly enough for starting out.

However, if you want a full painting starter kit, I recommend having

- 
        Watercolor kit
      
Student: Winsor & Newton Cotman 12 half-pan kit Professional: Winsor & Newton 12 half-pan field pocket kit


- Student: Winsor & Newton Cotman 12 half-pan kit

- Professional: Winsor & Newton 12 half-pan field pocket kit

- 
        1 tube white gouache
      


- 
        Brushes (at least one ½-5/8 in flat brush and 1 round brush)
      


- Portable water container

- 
        Sketchbook
      


- Many, many paper towels

- Optional: water squeeze bottle, additional palette, watercolor pencils

I also love learning from other artists like James Gurney who originally taught me what en plein air even is. I learned so much from James Gurney about conveying light and color both through his videos and also his amazing book about the subject. Also, here’s a very comprehensive blog post he wrote about supplies for en plein air painting. Other artists that inspire me include Studio Ghibli background artists like Kazuo Oga and Yoichi Nishikawa as well as famous en plein air oil painters like John Singer Sargent and of course, Claude Monet himself.

The same advice applies for learning an instrument and really, with most things in life: practice, practice, practice. It’s the only concrete path for improvement. If you choose to give en plein air art a try or explore another creative outlet, I hope you have fun with it, enjoy the moment, and maybe even discover something new about yourself along the way!

After this summer, I finally feel fully myself again—reconnected with my artistic side and no longer hesitant to call myself an artist. I learned that I never truly lost this part of me; even during my break, it quietly grew alongside me, patiently waiting for my return.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chattahoochee_painting-800x600.jpeg

Welcome our new bloggers!,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",4,2025-09-16T00:00:00-04:00,"After much deliberation over the 66 applications we received this summer, we are happy to announce our new bloggers!

Please give a warm welcome to:



- Hala K. ‘29 from Michigan, who built not only robots but also endearing memories at MITES, and knows her best friends better than any online personality test out there.

- Taylor L. ‘29 from North Carolina, who went on a quest to find a Pink Lemonade Celsius near her hometown, and has much to tell you about the virtues of serif fonts in this day and age.

- Boheng C. ‘28 from California, who has biked all the way from campus to beaches and shipyards, and liveblogged from the depths of a freezing New England cave.

- Victor D. ‘27 from California, who cherishes the identities built into the squares and streets of Boston, and finds unfamiliar paths in familiar places to meet new friendly faces. (Hey, that rhymed!)

- Caleb M. ‘27 from Texas, whose first walk down the Infinite Corridor was during a snowy Boston haze, and loves bagels and sandwiches but HATES bagel sandwiches.

They got some banger posts coming soon, so stay tuned!

For those who didn’t get selected this time: thank you so much for taking the time and effort to apply. Writing for an audience takes a lot of vulnerability, courage, and mental energy. Also, as long as you’re an MIT undergrad then you can re-apply next summer! We hope that you continue sharing your story to the world, and we are excited to see what you will create.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-16-at-6.33.51-PM-800x627.png,1
cookies,Aiden H. '28,5,2025-09-13T00:00:00-04:00,"Call it big-boned or call it taste, but I’ve always loved 
        cookies.
      
 I grew up as a massive baker, and every December I take it as a mission to bake as many cookies as possible and hand them out to people I know–meaning keeping a gallon-sized Ziploc of cookies in my middle school backpack, slipping them under the desk to friends during class.

So the other night, on another casual thought spiral about the innumerable delights of cookies, I realized how many idioms about cookies there are, if not the most of any dessert. I count six for cookies, 
        four for cake,
      
 
        one for pie,
      
 and 
        zero for ice cream.
      
 There can only be one anthropological and etymological answer: cookies are a foundational part of human nature, and their significance is represented in our phrases.

Because of this, I’ve been thinking a lot about what cookies could mean to me and MIT culture, and how all the phrases work together.

***

Smart cookie (or, doing well)

So you grow up “gifted and talented” or whatever. But this is almost definitely a reflection of sociocultural factors and your willingness to be quiet as a child and not your passion about math or whatever.

But you enjoy it, but who wouldn’t? Things are easy for a long time, and you don’t walk around telling everyone about how “great” you are, but adults will tell you and eventually you believe it just a little.

Eventually you do have to start making a choice, and you make a good one–to try. You actually can be interested in the things you’re doing, and past the expectations of what you should be doing, you do it anyway because a part of you just likes it and it helps you in the long run.

Everything is sweet.

If you give a mouse a cookie (or, getting addicted to success)

Soon you’re not so special, and that’s fine because that’s being a person, but so far your only thing has been being special, so who are you?

You’re a person who clings to it. You try even harder. It’s an easy spiral to go down, and one you get tunnel-visioned into every couple weeks without realizing it.

If you give a mouse a cookie, it might be able to recognize itself quickly as a junk-food junkie. But if you give a mouse a cookie and then surround it with other cracked-out mice running in circles and snorting chocolate chips, the mouse is gonna think they’re pretty well off. They have “balance” compared to the other mice.

And then you snap out of it as soon as you get a little burnt out and remember that nothing is ever that deep that you need to major in finance or understand 
        what YC does.
      


You feel trapped in the bubble of it all though, you know?

Accept all cookies (or, how much of yourself to give away)

You gave your life away to work at age 15, and you’re already pretty tired. You would rather be doing a lot of other things that most teenagers probably would. But now it feels all you have to look forward to is work, because you spent the fun part of life working, and you can’t realistically spend the work part of life just messing around. Adults tell you all the time to enjoy the now, that soon all you’ll have to do is worry about work and bills, which feels ridiculous, because all you do and all you feel you’ve ever done is worry about work.

But then every couple days in class, your professors talk about how you’re going to use something in the real workforce one day, and you remember that this whole thing so far hasn’t even been work, it’s literally just been the training.

This is still the training?

You debate about if you’re committing too much, because on the surface everyone talks about work-life balance, but secretly you know that you still have to be successful on paper to get everything you want. But now what you want is to be successful on paper, so everything is getting hazy.

You remember a triangle you saw once:



It’s an oversimplification, sure, but you’re also able to trace back everyone’s life ever to the triangle, so you buy into it.

You know exactly which one you’ve always given up.

Hand in the cookie jar (or, humility)

So you realize it’s pretty bad because even your 
        Spotify Daylist is starting to call you out.
      
 What do you do when you’re caught red-handed in an emotional nightmare? You project it onto others, duh! You remind yourself that you could have it so much worse and you give advice to others about how to fix their own problems, because if you can subconsciously convince yourself that you’re doing better than others, then that means you’re probably just whining about your problems and they’re not real.

And then someone gives you advice (that traitor!) and it feels like a slap to the face that people around you can see how bad you’re doing.

Tough cookie (or, resilience)

Stepping away is hard (recall, you are still a cookie-junkie-mouse-human hybrid in this scenario, after all). You don’t know what to cut out first, but even the act of recognizing it is relieving.

You cut out things that are purely pompous. Yeah, it’s on your LinkedIn or resume or whatever, but who are you doing this for? And some things you do still feel a little performative, but you still have to do it for general society/job market/success criteria. Because you know this, though, you commit yourself a lot less.

At the end of the day, you realize people who do this much calculus should be able to take care of themselves, because they know how to and just choose not to. So you grow a little better at it, and over time you don’t feel like you’re dying. Busy and dying are not the same thing, and you start to accept it.

That’s the way the cookie crumbles (or, the stupidest saying of all time)

Bullshit. Not only do sayings like this defend every bad thing that’s ever happened, but they remove any sense of control you have over your life.

You are choosing to be here. You do not have to go to class every day, you want to. And while the two options of summer vs. MIT feel like two extremes, you’re still picking one extreme over the other, and you can very well reverse it. If you had literally nothing to do and the world at your fingers, you would still probably gravitate towards learning about what you are right now anyway, but you’re naturally curious, and that will never change.

I don’t want to be 55 with an awful job and no memories just shrugging saying “that’s the way my life worked out”. 
        That’s how it worked out because that’s how I chose it to work out.
      


This is all easier said than done. I write on here like I’m so emotionally enlightened and then go crying to everyone around me that I don’t get anything I want or my life will never work out how I want. And it probably won’t work out how I play it in my head, but it sure as hell won’t be because “it is what it is” but instead because I have the highest of hopes for myself, which isn’t always a bad thing to have.

Even with it all, you can always just calm down and eat some cookies.

albums i like and why i like them,Kayode D. '27,3,2025-09-08T00:00:00-04:00,"I like music. A lot. And I like telling other people about the music that I like. I message my friends fairly often asking if they’ve listened to [insert mildly obscure musician here], and their random album from 2018. I keep having new ones, and I want some way to document why I like the albums that I like. So here is a list of cool musical 
        projects
      
 that I like and why I like them. Imagine we’re walking through Newbury Comics, and I see this record, run over to you, and being to yap about why i like it: 

 

Beat The Champ [2015] – The Mountain Goats

I’m not sure how I found this album, but I love it. It’s like the 5th album put out by The Mountain Goats, and it’s a concept album about Chavo Guerrero, a WWE lucha wrestler that the singer (and presumed protagonist of the album) watched as a kid in Texas. The album follows the boy as he grows up watching Chavo, and the path that Chavo had to walk in his life as a wrestler. I went down a wikipedia rabbit hole one day, so this might all be wrong but this is what I remember: 

The creator of this album, John Darnielle, didn’t have many good memories with his step father. One point of contact between the two was professional wrestling. The two would frequently go to watch the local circuit of obscure wrestlers where John’s stepdad, Mike, would sometimes be the only person cheering for the heel, or villain. In his preteen years, John became obsessed with wrestling and watched twice a week on a black and white TV. He always rooted for the hero, and whenever they threw out the rulebook against the heel to fight fire with fire, it would ignite something primal in him. His favorite wrestler was Chavo Guerrero Sr.

Chavo Guerrero was born the son of Gordy Guerrero, an early pioneer of the Mexican Lucha Libre fighting circuit. The Guerreros had a wrestling ring in their backyard, and Chavo would practice wrestling with his uncle of a similar age, Eddie Guerrero. The two would grow up and join wrestling circuits, eventually making it to WWE. Eddie was known to be a “cheater” in the ring, and would try to get Chavo to fight dirty as well, although Chavo resisted. The two fought in tag team matches and individually, seeing a moderate amount of success, before the Hair Match (climax of the album), in which Chavo took on Eddie, and the loser got their head of long hair shaved by the victor.

Eddie passed away on November 13, 2005, and Chavo continued to wrestle in Eddie’s honor. The album shifts from peppy and “wrestlemania!”-esque into a more somber tone, and I think this album hits especially hard when you know the full story. It makes the final track, Hair Match, even more resonant. 

Thank you Bry for getting me the physical CD of this album for my birthday. 

Fav. Tracks: Choked Out, Luna

 

The Only Members That Show Up [2018] – Tomtsu

This album is amazing. Tomtsu was active from 2018 – 2021, and was based out of Boston. I know, like, 3 Boston Bands and this is one of them. This is an album of complex guitar riffs and absolutely KILLER drum rhythms. I would describe it as “asymmetric” in the best way possible. They have this one song called “This Is Milk” off of their 2021 EP “the last tsupper” where they end with a syncopated 4/4 guitar riff and a non-linear, distinctly NON-4/4 drum solo over it. And this album, their self-titled freshman album, is the beginning of their grungy-nerdy-math rocky-asymmetrical musical sound.

And they were in high school when they made this album. HIGH SCHOOL. Puts me to shame. 

They also have a youtube channel where they recorded a ton of their live shows so you can literally watch the band grow over the years.

Fav. Tracks: Tongue Tied, Marmalade

 

The Masquerade [2019] – mxmtoon

I listened to mxmtoon for the first time like 
        a week
      
 ago, and this album, The Masquerade, is SO GOOOOD. It’s her first full album, and was released after her senior year of high school. It features the song “prom dress,” which went viral on tiktok in 2018. The album is a big collection of love songs, and it opens with some bangers. Unspoken Words, Prom Dress, Blame Game – a lot of bops. But 
        the most important song in the entire album
      
 is the 6th track, my ted talk. In this song, mxmtoon reveals that she’s never been in love before. She explains that she writes these songs as if she’s an expert, but she’s only fooling herself. I think this singlehandedly makes the album at least 11 times better. Now, not only can you relate to the love songs if you have been in love, but if you haven’t been in love, you can relate to mxmtoon on an even deeper level because you too want these things you don’t really know anything about. With this one song, she succeeds in hitting two major groups in the apparent target audience– teenagers in high school. Just look at me: I’m a guy that didn’t even go to prom. I can’t relate at all to prom dress, and yet I love that song so much, because I know that I don’t relate to it! It’s a big metaphor! 

Also, mxmtoon plays fortnite and posts about it on her instagram so yeah. pretty cool.

Fav. Songs: prom dress, blame game, dream of you

 

Hard Feelings [2017] – Future Teens

If Tomtsu is one of the only Boston bands that I know, Future Teens is the other one.

[I have a lot of thoughts about this. I think that if I went to MIT before the mainstream rise of spotify and personal streaming platforms, I would know a lot more Boston bands. Where would I get my music? From record stores or friends. So the music I buy is limited by physical transfer. And furthermore, I would have to be lent music by my friends!]

Future Teens was formed in 2014 by a group of friends [pictured above] who created a band to perform for a Fourth of July BBQ. Their music is described as “Bummer-pop” which to me sounds how it felt to apply to college, haha. Kind of like how crying really hard feels good afterwards. It’s comforting. I like it

I found this album freshman year of MIT and listened to it on loop during freshman fall. It was the first album that I listened to from beginning to end on repeat. They’re so witty and clever with all of their song titles, and when I saw them live that November with my friend, Noah R. ’27, they retuned there guitars between every song, haha.

They also sold Future Teens Trading Cards at the checkout. Top Tier band.

Fav. Songs: Expiration Dating,  In Love or Whatever, Bored and Alone [off of the 2023 Deluxe Edition]

Older Boys [2014] – Art Sorority

Words cannot begin to describe the deep and immense love I have for this album. 

Art Sorority (formerly 
        Art Sorority for Girls
      
), is the personal project of Daoud Tyler-Ameen. Older boys is his second album, and is made up of songs he wrote while in college and afterwards. He uses lines that cut sharper than a knife and chords I didn’t even know existed. He puts so much passion into these songs as he writes about relationships, growing up, his father, and a bunch of other things that I probably don’t even fully understand. Each song is like a little universe, and every time I listen this album never disappoints. 

I shared this album with my friend, Caleb, and we both have grown to deeply appreciate this album and the time that we shared it. For Caleb’s birthday I was able to get THE ACTUAL Art Sorority to sign an album cover to make this custom CD: 

[neither of us took a picture of the cd, i will add when Caleb gets back to me.]

Thanks DTA! 

DTA is also the drummer in the band Bad Moves, which has made a ton of bangers, and I would listen to their 2018 album while driving in my 2010 Nissan Altima in high school. Bad Moves has now disbanded, but DTA recently announced new Art Sorority music, so be on the lookout for that!

getting back in the groove,Aiden H. '28,5,2025-09-03T00:00:00-04:00,"Once upon a time in a land far, far away

A group of schoolchildren gathered to recount their days.

One says they cried, one says they laughed, but they all agreed in one very unfortunate path.

That when the leaves fall down, sky turns blue to grey

The freshman will forever cease to live in their PNR ways

Instead learning the trials that come to all.

Beware, the sophomore fall!

***

Uh so yeah I’m gonna be a sophomore, and just saying that didn’t feel like dramatic enough of an opening. I wanted it to sound like an old nursery rhyme or something, but I also didn’t care that much so I wrote it in 
        like 3 minutes.
      


But anyway, people say sophomore year is the worst, but it’s also kinda the year class-wise, at least for 10B. You’re done with the GIRs and starting classes specifically for your major, but everyone in the major still has to take them, so the class sizes are still larger and the classes are well-known.

Well funny enough (I planned it), this happens to be the first day of classes on campus, so I got an exclusive look into the so-called awful time everyone is having! This will be nothing too crazy, but it is for sure something I will want to look back on at the end of the semester to see if this excitement is just first-week delusion or the start of a new chapter in my MIT career (and feelings towards it).

Here are the classes, in order of appearance:

5.07 – Introduction to Biochem (MWF 9:00 AM)

I was like a teenager on the phone with their first crush: sitting in the back, kicking my feet, smiling and blushing trying to hide my excitement. I have ALWAYS wanted to take a biochem class. I might seriously take 
        5.13
      
 just so I can take 
        5.08,
      
 depending on how this class goes. It almost feels dissociative to be in this class. I feel like biochem has a lot of topics that we go our whole lives, in and out of the classroom, vaguely knowing that they happen but never really understanding step-by-step. Like babies know they’re alive, kids know we have cells, high schoolers know we metabolize, but no one really knows what is actually going on. To actually be in the class knowing that in like 7th grade I was sitting there thinking “This will all make sense one day” is trippppppy.

Judging the syllabus though it’s gonna be pretty lethal…

5.601 – Thermodynamics I (MWF 10:00 AM)

I have a love-hate relationship with the little thermodynamics that I know. In high school chem and 
        5.111,
      
 I did very well in the thermodynamics units, always finding the work to be fairly easy and not painful to do.

Having to sit down and listen to thermodynamics, though, does fill me with enough boredom to tranquilize a horse, or like, Godzilla. I’ll do the pset I’ll learn the topic whatever whatever, but today was just like defining temperature and pressure. Praying we get past PV=nRT in the first week.

18.03 – Differential Equations (MWF 1:00 PM)

Long story short I was gonna ASE this class and then missed the sign-up deadline, so I lowkey know the first half of the class, and the second half I’ve heard is harder but very very doable. Most people at MIT take this class anyway, so I have no abundance of people to help me.

The professor is a very fun and energetic Russian guy, but he was just reading the lecture notes word for word and maybe adding an example here and there. If it doesn’t get more useful it might be an “Aiden goes to lecture when he doesn’t already know a topic” kinda class.

10.10 – Introduction to Chemical Engineering (MWF 2:00 PM)

Every single sophomore who declared 10/10B/10ENG has to take this class right now, so it’s just 44 of us in a room, fresh-faced and wide-eyed trying to figure out basic ChemE. It gives a strong sense of community among us since we’re all sitting in there at the same time, so super cute.

On the other hand, the professors and peers described the class as very very challenging. They are either:

- Trying to hype themselves up and in reality the class is just fine

- I won’t make it past October

Time will tell!

11.041 – Introduction to Housing, Community, and Economic Development (TR 9:30 AM)

This is the only class I didn’t have today, so this one will have to remain a mystery in the public eye for now.

When I read through all the HASS classes to pick one, this was at the top of my list because:

- It is so societally and politically important.

- It is something I could never learn to the same extent on my own outside of an academic environment, full of professionals and hand-selected literature to teach me (whereas I feel some HASS classes are things I could learn/do on my own time without much penalty).

It is a 1.5 hour discussion-based class, which means lots and lots of readings!! The final project is to design your own city and defend it to the class, so you already know I’m about to have the craziest city name you’ve ever heard.

***

I simultaneously feel so prepared and so underprepared for the coming semester.


        I didn’t do much this summer
      
 and it was beautiful. I did do my UROP part-time, but it was remote and asynchronous, so I mostly did it in bed or past 11 PM, so I don’t really count it as “work” as much as a 9-5. Most of my days were spent waking up late, seeing friends, watching TV, swimming, or seeing a movie. It was, all in all, entirely peaceful.

In part because of this summer, and in part because this is my 14th year of school, this is the first time in my life I’m not itching to go back out of boredom. School has always very much been a cop out for me, and for the first time I’m kinda enjoying just living. (Still need the A’s for grad school though so bye-bye drive-in movies and swimming in the reservoir). While this makes me slightly less inclined to sit down and do a pset, I think it means that I’m at a better place where I’m enjoying life more, so I’ll take it as a good sign.

With everything in me, I want to try and still do things outside of class as much as I can, to make “summer” last longer. Here’s a list of life things I want to do in tandem with the academia that is about to suppress it. This isn’t meant to be a super in-depth or rigid list, but more just ideas of things I would like to force myself to do more (i.e. sticking to numerical goals is not that big of a necessity as long as I do something a little bit, but also that’s what people who don’t finish their goals say so adkfhgduhfv):

- Read more during the semester. Not too much more, just a little before bed every night to help me fall asleep instead of going over my to-do list for tomorrow. Three books this semester and I’m happy. Right now I’m reading Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil by 
        V.E. Schwab.
      


- Blog four times a month??? My reasoning is that if I can already call my mom once a week with life updates, then there has to be at least something to share, even if boring/tedious/crash-out core.

- Exercise. I hate it. It makes me feel bad about myself. I hate gym culture. I hate that everything is now protein-supplemented when most Americans already get way above the recommended amount of protein. Nonetheless, would I rather feel semi-bad about myself for an hour a day or fall and break a hip at 60?

- Budget. Now that I switched from Maseeh to East Campus for housing, I’m not on a meal plan and have to consistently buy groceries and cook for myself. My goal is to spend no more than ~$500/month on food while also not subjecting myself to Instant Noodles every night.

- Get cool winter clothes. I’m thinking like trench coat and scarf, but that might be very last year. I am definitely far from a fashionista, and have largely not cared about clothes my entire life. And while I still don’t care, I do notice that waking up and putting on an adult outfit makes me feel more productive and I’m less likely to crawl into bed in the middle of the day.

- Find something new. I feel like my goals are always me telling myself to increase the amount of me doing things I already do/know I should. Maybe there’s a reason I’m not doing them. Maybe a new hobby is waiting for me that could incite a passion for leisurely activities that don’t make me feel guilty for not studying. I want to do anything new to any extent. New club. New recipe. New daily habit. Even a new cool like trinket or gadget for my room I could show people. Something completely new to get me excited.

A part of me feels like this is a huge jinx, and this will become something I never live up to, how in a couple weeks I’ll post about how hosed and stressed I am, and in a few years when a random person does an inevitable blogger deep-dive, this will be a post they stumble upon and then see I didn’t post for months or read at all etc. etc. But just like 10.10, only time will tell!

Happy fall semester!🍁",,0
"[Guest Post] This is Junior Lab, not Junior Theory",Ellie F. '28,2,2025-09-01T00:00:00-04:00,"8.13, or as it is more commonly known, Junior Lab or JLab, is the first experimental class in the “standard” 8 path. Most 8s take it 
        Junior Fall
      
 after >=3 semesters of theory classes.

The first few weeks (the Intro Period) are spent ensuring everyone has a common base of experimental skills. Practically, this means many small tasks in areas such as programming, statistics, LaTeX, and electronic equipment. You then do an “intro” experiment, either the Photoelectric Effect or Michelson Interferometry, which is a test-run for the workflow of a “full” experiment. For the intro experiment, there are only 3 hours of data collection (as opposed to the normal 15 hours) but you still give a full 15-minute presentation and write a 4-page paper. These are graded for completion! The format is hard the first time, but much easier the second so this is your chance to do paper and with no consequences if you miss the mark. The comments from your professor and your first practice will then make your first graded assignments go much smoother. Then, you choose two “full” experiments to work on for 5 lab sessions and write an associated paper + presentation (I did Johnson and shot noise and 21 cm radio astrophysics, two amazing experiments 10/10 I absolutely recommend). Everyone designs their own 3rd experiment using a pair of CosmicWatches, which measure muon flux. At the end, you polish your favorite presentation and give it in front of the whole class (not just the professor and TA) and any other people who might drop in.

Look at how much stuff is packed into the first three weeks. It is literally ⅓ of the calendar 😭

 

JLab has a bad reputation. It is a class that people hear about before they even declare physics. Some common phrases to describe it are “stressful,” “time sink,” “frustrating,” and “draining.” For some of us though, JLab is one of the best classes in the physics curriculum. I’m here to tell you why this class is amazing. 



In the intro period, there is a discussion regarding what constitutes a 
        good lab notebook.
      
 There are several funny things in the sample 
        notebooks
      
 but this is my favorite part. First of all, every day is calibration day. Secondly, the phrase 
        “I love electromagnets”
      
 has three words in it. ‘I’ has one letter in it. 
        Sean
      
 mispelled every word in that sentence, and I crack up every time I see this. Even your instructors make typos :) 

This series of comments does kind of encompass JLab: mistakes, funny moments, and experimental physics. 

JLab was the first place I felt I 100% belonged in physics. Coming into JLab, I was under the impression that most physicists were theorists. I didn’t think I was a “real” physics major because I liked hands-on work. As an engineering double major (in Course 16, AeroAstro), I cared about building things, testing, and troubleshooting. As far as I saw, physics majors cared about math, creating 
        thought experiments
      
, and the innate beauty of equations. I thought my interest in physics was that of an enthusiastic amateur but that I didn’t have the “right personality” to be a physicist. 

Enter JLab. For the first time in 8, I saw myself in my instructors. My professor, TAs, and the lab staff were excited about hands-on work. They talked about real, imperfect systems, not idealized equations. Answers to my questions were grounded in observables. The weird effects from the design of each specific apparatus were considered important, not details to be brushed off because they’re not “fundamental.” One of my friends once described  
        8.06
      
 as “systems aren’t in equilibrium and how to cope with that.” In a similar vein, JLab is “systems aren’t isolated and how to cope with that.” It had always bothered me that physics PSETS seemed contrived. In JLab suddenly my professors wanted to talk about all the extraneous effects besides the theory being studied.  

This was eye-opening: I misunderstood a huge portion of the profession. Experimental physics combined things I loved in both engineering and physics: it was hands-on and the driving question was “why” (whereas in engineering it is closer to “how”). Initially, I thought that they (the powers above in the physics department) had taken an engineering class and disguised it as a physics lab class because the activities in the intro period were so reminiscent of lab and design questions on my engineering PSETs. Engineering made JLab feel 
        familiar.
      
 It was amazing to learn that physicists care about the same things I do! 


        JLab
      
 would not exist without the lab staff (Sean, Aaron, and Cory 
), professors (for me, Gunther and Christoph), TAs, and 
        WRAP
      
 staff. The class is logistically very complex (see the calendar above), and they do a huge amount of work behind the scenes. 

More importantly, they want you to learn. Lab staff and professors have, and continue to, think about the best way for students to spend their time. They are not giving you busy work or trying to make your life hard. If in doubt, ask what the purpose of an assignment is. There is always a purpose. In general, if in doubt, ask. The teaching team has answers to many questions both JLab-related and non-JLab-related. 

In addition to being absurdly good at teaching, the people on the teaching team are just generally awesome! They care deeply for what they do, and a part of that is engaging with students. Go talk to them!!! Getting to hang out with cool people is also part of the fun! Go get advice and have interesting conversations and learn that they have pets and plants and opinions on 
        trains.
      


Back to the class……

I loved that the “end” of the experiment was poorly defined. The syllabus doesn’t say you must measure a quantity to a certain precision or include a certain number of calibrations to earn a certain grade. Rather, you must make a defensible measurement through performing an experiment. This ambiguity can be hard because you never really know if you’ve met expectations. Because of this, I defined success based on whether I felt satisfied with my results instead of based on grades. Feedback helped me calibrate “good enough” (this includes in uncertainty analysis, soft skills, paper layout, and so on) but my focus was on achieving a personal goal, not achieving an unknown benchmark for a grade. Since I defined the endpoint, I could justify my workaholic tendencies pouring a lot of time into the experiments. If I set the “end” then I was doing the work for myself, not for a grade or a class. And if it is for myself, why shouldn’t I put in as much time as I want?

For my favorite experiment (21 cm radio astrophysics), I realized that something was wrong with the instrument. I looked at a reference point and didn’t get the expected result. This bothered me immensely and I spent the next month constantly searching for the source of the error. My “endpoint” was when a calibration matched the expected result and I was going to keep working on the experiment until I achieved that. One time Sean asked me if I knew I didn’t have to continue trying to solve the calibration problems. I knew I didn’t have to do it for them. But I had to do it for myself. It was like an itch I couldn’t scratch. 

The experiments felt like projects rather than assignments. This was great for me: I’ve always been far better at projects than exams. In a project, the end goal is broadly obvious, but the specific details to achieve that are up to me. In JLab, there was scaffolding in the lab manuals, but it was ultimately my project and therefore I could choose the direction to take it in. That was what I loved most about JLab: if I was willing to put in the extra work, I had the freedom to choose my own path. I could explore as many rabbit holes and do as many side quests as I wanted. 

I was free to abandon the lab manual, and the lab staff would then support me with the new analysis. They didn’t say “oh that’s interesting, but is beyond the scope of this class,” provide me a rough answer, and tell me to do something else. I had to drive the direction of the analysis, but they were resources I could ask questions to, bounce ideas off of, and try to solve problems with. In any experiment, when I realized I was just spinning my wheels, they helped me find ways to keep moving forward. 

Before I realized there was a problem with the radio telescope, I thought I was having a ~skill issue~ with basic algebra and geometry. I redid my math over and over again and could not find anything wrong (because I wasn’t wrong). I made all the lab staff check my math. I was ultimately met with “I don’t know.” Similarly in 8.14 (JLab II), I spent hours going back and forth with Oris about my analysis strategy for my exploratory project because I needed someone to brainstorm with. That was my favorite place to exist. I loved being so far off the “normal” path of the experiment that if I needed help, my instructors were equally as unsure as I was.

Interestingly, JLab also increased my interest in theory. For my Johnson and shot noise presentation, I brushed over the theory because I didn’t follow the derivation. Gunther was not happy with this and told me I needed a proper derivation in my paper. Unhappily, I went to go read the original paper. I followed the derivation, which was written in words not in equations, and when I had the “click” moment in the derivation I was so excited. I was telling my friends about it for days. For my next experiment, 21 cm radio astrophysics, I was then much more excited to delve into theory (which I didn’t because I had bigger fish to fry in addressing the calibration errors). 

I loved asking about the engineering of the apparatuses because the explanation was always accompanied by an explanation of the underlying theory. These provided the justification to problems I had learned in theory classes. Having a tangible observable or piece of instrumentation that I want to understand means that I need to understand theory better. 

In general, I need theory to fully interpret my experimental results. Theory helps guide what experiments are designed and it gives me the framework to separate confounding variables from the physics being studied. If I don’t understand what other things could be causing something, how do I know what is actually causing something? Experiment and theory are symbiotic and I didn’t realize I was missing half of that relationship before JLab.

This doesn’t make theory classes easier, though the physical and experimental intuition helps. Rather, it motivates the problems we study in theory classes. For example, take a point charge directly above a circular hole in a conducting plane. That’s not a practical problem. If I instead think of it as an electron on a straightaway before it goes through a velocity selector, suddenly I 
        care.
      
 That is a practical problem. That is why I study physics. JLab gave me the background to reframe theory PSET problems into more practical problems which created a positive feedback loop between experiment and theory.

At times JLab was certainly “stressful,” “a time sink,” and “frustrating.” 
 JLab was very different from anything I had done previously in physics. The path to success was not the same as in the other 8 classes so strategies I had grown accustomed to weren’t helpful. After all, it was Junior Lab, not Junior Theory. 

But, for the first time in physics, the joy of learning didn’t come with a catch. I could put in more time and actually get better results. While I didn’t particularly enjoy the 
        papers or presentations
      
, they were infinitely preferable to a written exam. I was able to predict questions I’d be asked in my Q&A 
 and answer those I didn’t anticipate. I made plenty of mistakes in JLab (see the screenshots from my lab notebooks below), but they felt like a sign I was on the right track, rather than proof I was lost.

I gave an awful CosmicWatch presentation. It was horribly embarrassing to look Gunther, a particle physicist, in the eye and butcher an explanation of his field. He took the Q&A to explain how cosmic ray muons are produced (which should have been slide 0), gave a brief overview of particle physics, and said he disagreed with my major uncertainty calculation. It was mortifying, but rather than just brushing me off with a bad grade, he corrected me. The instructors’ critiques are a sign that they care. They are choosing to give you more of their time because they believe you can do better work. That’s the point. We make mistakes (sometimes huge ones) and in Junior Lab, we then go fix them. 

You know what feedback I didn’t fix though? For every single paper and presentation in 8.13 (JLab), I received feedback to increase my font size on plot axes. One of the comments for my final paper was “Figures could still use somewhat larger labels.” Every time I’d think “that’s an easy fix, I’ll remember it” and then every time I’d forget.

I did remember to increase it for the first 8.14 presentation! Then Christoph said it wasn’t large enough. Rip. In 8.14 we have “experiment reviews” which are dry-runs of our half-baked presentations on the last lab day for an experiment. In the review for my second experiment, Christoph told me my font size was “perfect.” It was 4 points smaller than the one he said was too small the previous week. He said nothing about it in the subsequent presentation or in any of our lab presentations so it’s fine now, I suppose. 

Conclusion: matplotlib 14 pt font is too small for Gunther, but 16 pt font is okay for Christoph. Default PowerPoint fonts are too small for Gunther but okay for Christoph. Except Christoph wants the slide numbers 2-4 pts larger.

Beyond genuinely enjoying being in lab every day, I got to do fun things like pour liquid nitrogen, work with a laser, and go up to the roof of 54. My camera roll has many, many, many JLab photos but here are some of my favorites! 

And I’m not the only JLab enjoyer! Over the last year, I’ve been approached by other 8’s who want to tell someone about a cool thing they did in JLab or a funny interaction. I’ve had people tell me that taking JLab changed what part of physics they want to go into; it certainly changed my path. For all the voices loudly that this class isn’t fun, from what I can tell, there are just as many who enjoy it. 

To future JLab students, I leave you with two final things. 

Firstly, take 8.14!!! It takes the most fun parts of 8.13 (the experiments), adds a handful of miscellaneous assignments which have a very good time-in to usefulness-out ratio, AND has the exploratory project. The exploratory project is amazing because you get credit (and money) to do your own experiment. It is just messing around with a topic you are interested in and is SO MUCH FUN. Unlike 8.13, you don’t have a big learning curve at the start of 8.14 so the class is much more relaxed. The quality of my analysis improved dramatically in 8.14 because I could focus primarily on improving the depth and quality of my analysis without simultaneously trying to learn all the other not-strictly-technical-but-still-necessary skills in 8.13. And it is much easier to balance than 8.13. It is a ton of fun — I absolutely recommend it!!!

Second, please add quotes to the #quotes channel in the JLab Slack. It is unfortunately underutilized, and many funny things are said in lab. Here are a couple that aren’t there for inspiration:

“Is this a book of shadows or a grimoire? It’s a grimoire. It’s a grimoire.” – Sean holding a giant book of gamma ray emission lines

“I’m going to try to make a step function in your data” – my advisor to me in a plane while we were collecting CosmicWatch data 


The flight path in question. See those big drops on the right? The nose of the plane was pointed frighteningly far down. The step function was achieved reasonably well though. Gunther did think this font was too small. Now I think the bigger problem is the serifs but oh well.

“I wonder why only terbium has wings…. maybe it’s because 
 RED BULL GIVES YOU WINGS!!!!” – Erin, then together

“If Sean isn’t cooking, I don’t belong in the kitchen” – Cory

I LOVE TATTE💖💖💖,Aiden H. '28,3,2025-08-30T00:00:00-04:00,"A Love Letter to Tatte

August 30th, 2025

Dearest Tatte,

It has been an awfully long while since I’ve graced upon your tiled floors, and I know that you could only be awaiting (all of) my money to support your fine establishment. Yet I return with the greatest of news–I have arrived!

After so many hot summer nights in Colorado reminiscing on your shakshuka, dreaming of your labneh, thirsting after your pistachio croissants, I run into your doors like it’s the first time, ogling at your immense pastry selection and chic decorations. It is easy to feel lost in the sea that is Boston cuisine 
        (bars),
      
 but even with so many options to choose (don’t get me started on our mutual enemy: Flour Cafe.), I of course come straight to you!

In fact, I sat down with a new menu item (spinach, corn, and egg plate) just this morning, grinning like child in a candy shop.

Although my visit was cut short to direct my mother to the airport, do not fret at the sight of me leaving! It will only be a very short matter of time before I see you again, grabbing an afternoon pick-me-up between 
        my new classes
      
 or 
        deciding to get out of my dorm
      
 between psets for a much needed comfort meal. Here’s to a new year!

xoxo,

Clinging to the Coattails of Identity,Allison E. '27,5,2025-08-29T00:00:00-04:00,"The summer before you come to MIT, there’s a bunch of forms to fill out–housing preferences, 
        FPOP applications
      
, advisor forms… You thought the get-to-know-you questions ended with college apps? Nope!

“Tell us about who you are, your background, and your interests (e.g. where are you from, your interests and hobbies, what you do for fun outside of class, what your advisor should know about you).” It’s a question that loosely summarizes identity as two things: where you come from, and what your interests are.

So, where am I from? That’s easy, and maybe moderately interesting. I’m from Hawaii–famous for our beautiful beaches and perfect weather, but also for our unique culture. If you’re in the market for somewhere to be from, I give Hawaii a resounding endorsement.

Saying I’m “from Hawaii” isn’t an entirely true statement, though. The real claim to being “from Hawaii”–to being a true “local”–generally involves being born and raised on island. I was not born in Hawaii. My dad was, and his parents, and their parents all were, so I grew up eating spam musubi and portuguese sausage, listening to Ka‘au Crater Boys and Iz, and learning to boogie board. But I lived in North Carolina up until middle school, and even several years after moving to Hawaii, home to me was still in NC. Hawaii’s beaches and weather and culture never really became a significant part of my identity.

So am I “from North Carolina”? A mainland girl at heart? Nothing can beat my dad’s smoked barbecue brisket, or the smell of fresh mulch in spring. Some of my best memories are of Fourth of July celebrations, when my little neighborhood world would coalesce into a patchwork of picnic blankets, char-grilled hotdogs, and cold Capri-Sun, where we’d wait for the family next door to light up their stash of fireworks smuggled across the South Carolina border. 

But, then again, it’s hard to proudly claim the mainland identity of “American” when I’ve also grown up in a 
        place that America forcefully conquered, illegally annexed, culturally repressed, and militarily exploited
      
. It’s hard to proudly claim the identity “American” when a guy at McDonald’s tells me to my face that I’m not actually from here. It’s hard to proudly claim the identity “American” when there’s so much about America that I’m not proud of.

To be honest, my solution in high school was just… not to care too much about where I was from. It just wasn’t a big part of my identity.

Ok, so what about my interests and hobbies, then? Well… this was also a tricky one. My first reaction to reading this part of the prompt was “… I don’t think I have any hobbies? Crap! I don’t have any hobbies!?!”

Sure, once upon a time I had hobbies. In elementary school, I summed up my identity exclusively with hobbies, all on a little charm bracelet: knitting needles, soccer ball, and a colorful stack of books. And honestly, I’d say that was a pretty accurate picture. Like a lot of people, though, I lost many of those hobbies when I started middle school. In theory I still liked crafts and reading, but I hadn’t picked up a pair of knitting needles or a soccer ball in years.

But hey, I was about to become an MIT student, right? Surely I had academic interests as well. And yeah, physics was cool, math problems were satisfying to solve, and space was fun to learn about. The thing was, though, I didn’t do any of these things for fun. I didn’t do math in my free time, or watch YouTube videos about Rayleigh scattering, or keep up with the NASA launch livestreams. If I woke up one day with absolutely zero interest in physics or crafts, I didn’t think I’d have an identity crisis. I didn’t think I’d be a different person. 

Instead, every time I tried to answer that “tell us about who you are” question, whether in college apps or desktop backgrounds or Discord “About Me” descriptions, I always ended up identifying myself by the extracurricular communities I was a part of. When I thought about who I was, I thought of trying to sneak pieces of blue painters tape onto the backs of my Sci Oly teammates. I thought of fastening the clasp on a friend’s marching band uniform. I thought of waking up at 3 am to a “team alive?” message on a Science Bowl group chat. I thought of covering our math team coach’s chalkboard with dotted lines instead of actual math, and of joining a circle of fifty girls to stretch out after a cross country practice. 

So when I first read the prompt “Tell us about who you are, your background, and your interests,” I was frustrated at how it boiled down identity to just background and interests. It maybe even felt like my identity was a little invalid.

After a few minutes of typing a slightly-annoyed response to the prompt, though, I realized that I was being a bit dramatic. “Oh no! How dare they ask a simple get-to-know-you question instead of demanding a detailed dissection of my mind, heart, and soul!” This is not another college application, Allison. They just want a way for you to connect with your advisor. You’re done with college applications, Allison. You’re done with—oh shit. You’re done with high school, Allison. You’re done with marching band, Allison. You’re done with Sci Oly and Math Team and cross country and…”

[Cue existential crisis]

So… yeah. That was the kicker. My identity was completely tied up in communities that I was leaving behind. Everything I had based my identity around for the past four years was going to disappear in three, two, one…

 

Zero.

 

It’s September 2023. My freshman year has begun, and I don’t really know who I am anymore. I can’t even be “the STEM kid” anymore, because it’s MIT, and everyone is the STEM kid. So who am I now?

Well, everyone is asking the same questions. “What’s your name?” “Where are you from?” “What’s your major?” 

You repeat the answers to those questions enough times, and eventually that version of identity becomes good enough. I became Allison, the girl from Hawaii, majoring in aerospace engineering. I cooked local Hawaii food for my friends–chicken long rice, butter mochi, and somen salad–even though I never ate much of it at home. I embraced my role as the token American in my international friend group’s conversations about culture, comparing our customs of respect, discussing middle school social dynamics, and touting the supremacy of 
        Fahrenheit
      
. I declared 
        Course 16
      
 as my major and joined a NASA challenge team to learn more about space exploration.

It’s the kind of identity that feels safe. I was placing myself in a very box-shaped box, as if I’d taken a sharpie and drawn a line around my identity, highlighting it in bright yellow for everyone to see. 

And yet, as much as these are real things I care about, a part of me now feels like I’m just clinging to the coattails of an alter ego’s identity. An alter ego who actually loves the beaches at Waimanalo, and who actually watched Perseverance’s landing on Mars. Hell, I’m not even an aerospace engineering major 
        anymore
      
. Maybe this identity I’ve been building is a fraud, or a costume I’ve been zipping myself into every day. 

Is it? Is it? Is it? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I don’t know. 

I’m still trying to figure out who I am outside of the simple, structured shorthand, so I don’t really have a good conclusion for this blog. I know that I love shenanigans, and snow, and big skirts, and laughing uproariously at things that maybe aren’t so funny. I know that time with friends is more important to me than my studies. Is that enough to make an identity? A pile of statements? I don’t know. But we’re figuring it out, I suppose. I guess I’ll always be figuring it out.",,0
my semesterly planner,Veronica P. '27,0,2025-08-18T00:00:00-04:00,"In less than a week I’ll be hopping on my flight back to Boston, and I’m so excited that I’m just about ready to kiss the Logan Airport floor, maybe even passionately make out with said airport floor 
.

Anyways, without meaning to I’ve gotten attached to this organizational ritual to prepare for the start of each new semester. I think some bullet-journaling-sleeper-agent in my brain kicked in orientation week freshman year, deciding that a digital calendar simply wasn’t going to cut it. Instead, I took advantage of my brand new Goodnotes subscription to create my own digital planner, whose format I have remained loyal to five semesters down the line.

 

behold, the planners!

There are only really three components to each setup, and I’ve found these are the perfect spreads I need to feel like I have my bearings without overdoing it. Everyone’s brain works differently, of course, but the act of writing things out really helps me internalize information. So, if you’re looking for inspiration— or just to reaffirm that Google Calendar is all you need— here is my setup broken down:

weekly schedule

The first page of my calendar is devoted to my recurring weekly schedule: from classes, to meetings, to highly-frequented office hours. This comes particularly in handy during those first few weeks when I’m still trying to remember room numbers or the minute difference between my Monday and Wednesday lineup.

this spring’s weekly schedule, where I TA’d for 8.02 and was notably fond of 2.005 office hours

monthly schedule

Next in my planner you’ll find a page for each month of the semester. I write down holidays, assignment due dates (color coded of course), events I’m looking forward to, and other appointments. Getting this birds eye view helps me plan ahead for particularly stressful weeks, or get motivated by the promise of a three-day weekend.

this year’s february

running todo list

The very final page of my planner is the most frequently edited, and that is my todo list. It tends to contain 5-7 days worth of tasks at any given time, with completed tasks being erased to make room for the next set. This is also color coded by class, and I add the due-date to the side of each one. Often, I’ll start my mornings off by outlining the tasks I want to tackle before the end of the day.

this page gets wiped regularly, so i guesstimated a random spring week

 

And that’s it!! Time to bask in these final precious weeks where my todo list doesn’t feel absolutely full to the brim. Happy back to school season, everyone <3","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1273-400x264.png

Rejection Therapy,Kayode D. '27,6,2025-08-16T00:00:00-04:00,"Today I flew back to campus!

I returned earlier that most students because I am an Orientation Captain. I have to come early for training and to help prepare everything for the 
        prefrosh
      
 impending arrival.

I was in the airport for my 8AM flight from Louisville to Boston, when I ran into Andrew P. ’28 Haylea B. ’27! They were flying early as well for orientation and 
        REX
      
, and our seats were next to one another!

On the plane

I listened to You Did It! a delightful new album by a band called Bugs Frogs & Snakes.  Would recommend!

When the plane landed, we made jokes about clapping so the pilot knows they did a good job. Otherwise how would they know, you know? I suggested asking for a photo with the pilot. Hailey mentioned a recent trend on 
        tiktok
      
 called “rejection therapy,” where people ask for things that they know they won’t get knowing they’ll face rejections, so that they become more used to it. Here’s a video:

The thing is, though, that in this video, he isn’t rejected, and they do let him climb inside the firetruck! So I said I was gonna do it, I was gonna ask the pilot for a picture. Andrew said he would, too, to make it less awkward.

When we got down there, we asked the pilot, and he said yes!

Andrew P. 28′, Shawn the Pilot, and Kayode D. ’27

We began talking with him about 
        how long he had to train to be a pilot
      
 and 
        how the Titans are gonna do this season
      
. Then he asked if we wanted trading cards.

DID HE JUST SAY TRADING CARDS??? Like, PILOT TRADING CARDS?? Like, I can talk to MORE PILOTS and collect PILOT TRADING CARDS????

My nerd brain neurons were activated. He grabbed his briefcase and pulled out a stack of DELTA AIRLINE TRADING CARDS.

He told us that they have these on all 
        Delta Airline planes
      
.

This rejection therapy experience worked, but not in the way that I expected at all!! Now I want to take pictures with EVERY pilot I meet! You literally never know when someone might hand you a trading card [👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀].

So now it’s  🫵 YOUR TURN 🫵 

As you come to campus for the first time or for the nth time, ask your pilot for a picture! Ask for a trading card! Put a picture in the comments! I wanna see what the other ones look like.

Also, don’t fear rejection, I guess? That’s probably the moral of this story, but I can’t get over how STINKING COOL MY AIRPLANE TRADING CARD IS. Maybe I’ll try doing things that are awkward more now. I watched a few more of those rejection therapy videos and they are so awkward, but look like they teach so much. I hate “failure”, but I know how good it is for you.

Also, reject technology, embrace tradition. Why limit yourselves to the confines of “technological advancement” [escalators] when you can unleash your potential and forge your own path? [take the stairs]

OK, I need to go to the store now because I have no food.

…

Update: I bought only fruit and now I just have fruit. If you killed my character I would drop trading cards and fruit, like a common enemy.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pilot-picture.jpg

proof of life,Gloria Z. '26,2,2025-08-16T00:00:00-04:00,"preface:

- this blog is comprised of various snippets I wrote in May, very loosely stitched together because I gave up on trying to have a thesis. also the writing is not very snappy oops

- the soundtrack to this blog is the album Blue Moon Safari by Air and Vegyn :-)

Last fall, I took a lighter academic load, two classes, so that I could work an internship during the daytime hours. I was writing embedded code for hardware systems, which was somewhat engaging, but, in true Severance fashion, I felt myself blink out and in of existence as I crossed the threshold of the office each morning and evening. The meat of each day was some combination of staring at Jira, VS Code, C++ docs, and the free snack selection in the mini-kitchen; what I remember best, instead, are the bones before and after, the slow trek through Cambridge and Somerville, first past looming biotech towers, then through not-quite-suburban residential areas, then into an area in the midst of construction, still carrying the vestiges of 1900s industrial Cambridge. The image is vivid: a placid fall scene with sidewalks covered in paper-mache leaves and a strange sort of black dirt residue, with adorable houses lining the two-lane (no bike lane!) streets. They sported dusty candy colors, worn and chipped in all the right ways; in the front lawns, there were half-open grills, smudged plastic toys, and low-slung lounge chairs faded by weather and use. Proofs of life.

I found myself staring at these houses each day as I passed, wondering about the poor souls oxidizing inside. I felt myself grow thirty years older in the span of a block; the horizon melted from my thoughts, replaced by stacks of unopened mail and grocery store receipts. A ticking timer on a carton of milk and a slab of chicken waiting to be thawed. An overwhelming sense of doom would trickle and pool in my chest, like syrup, softening.

Maybe it’s because I grew up in the suburbs, but I’ve always felt a creeping sense of dread at this vision of settling–not settling as in settling for something less, but settling as in stopping, resting, putting down roots deep into the dirt. With this dread came an aversion to all those elements of domestic or “traditional” life: having kids, getting married, buying a single-family home. Filling up gas, having a mortgage. Planting a sapling in the front yard. I’ve realized I like the feeling of always being somewhat agitated, having something on the horizon, and, probably unrealistically, I have this idea of “adulthood” as a flat circle: mostly always the same, spinning uniformly, stable, settled, secure, satisfied. In some way, then, I’m scared of being satisfied–not in a sigma male productivity core way, but in an almost childish way, like a kid who has eyes bigger than her stomach and wants to have it all, no matter the cost.

Every summer I feel that I get a taste of this settling. Whether I’m doing research or working an internship, life slows down, to an almost sluggish pace, no more random events, no more chance encounters, no more long nights in the library. My calendar is empty save the occasional social event, and I don’t need notifications to remember what’s going on in my day: I leave the house at 8:02AM and take the 8:13AM bus; my days are work plus workout plus meals, and maybe one other thing if I have the time and energy. The weeks, minus minor differences, seem to blur together, especially when I’m in the office. It’s somewhat monotonous, yet very comfortable. After all, on many counts, life is better than when I’m in school. I sleep consistently and well, I eat healthy meals at regular times, I feel generally more in control and steady, more relaxed in my off hours. The weekends mean free time and leisure, rather than extra time to catch up on psets. I have more time to watch movies, to try new restaurants, and to spend extended periods of time in nature.

And yet, there’s still a part of me that thrashes and whines: “Is this it? Is this all?” It feels uncomfortable to rotate slowly in place, without some menacing goal on the horizon. So maybe this is why people enter midlife and run a marathon. (As someone who picked up running this summer, this is mostly a dig at myself.) Grabbing coffee from the micro kitchen, I can blink and see the afterimage of ten more years unrolling in front of me – graduating, working, having a family, baking bread on the weekends. By all means a happy life, really. 

Maybe I’m preempting a midlife crisis (and therefore inciting one), prompted by an impending graduation and an immense sense of newness with each passing season. Over the past year I’ve felt a guttural drop into early adulthood, not a swan dive off a cliff but a slow winding descent, as I started booking my own flights and travel plans and scheduling monthly payments into my Roth IRA. First apartment, first taxes, first conversation with my mom as (almost) equal adults rather than child and parent. At the same time, the future slit itself open and fell splayed like a cake box; my classmates graduated or took leave and generally dispersed, calling new cities “home” and sinking their own pincers deep into the black dirt. I felt that there was never any rush after all. I felt more pressure than ever to pick the figs up off the ground.

Anyway –

May in Boston means 65 degrees, air the same temperature as your body, on the precipice of sweat. The end of junior year means sitting in a sticky circle with friends you think you understand a little better now, tracing conversations you’ve already had a million times, but now with slightly different vocabulary and a bit more shared history. It’s asking them how much they value their relationships versus their work, in a meta impersonal sort of way, and hearing the same answer that you would give, but maybe not the answer you’re supposed to want to hear. It’s folding all your belongings over themselves into two tired boxes, carrying them by hand over the bridge, and stashing your bike in an anonymous emailer’s backyard shed. I had spent spring semester frantically and methodically reducing, simmering my life on medium heat until the moisture steamed off, trying to loop into a point I couldn’t quite grasp. There was a strange freneticism to the semester, of collapsing a billion possible futures into one, and of gently parting soft lips and peeling one back into many, every conversation tinged with slight hopeful premonition.

points if you know what movie this is from

May in Boston is – false beginnings, casual goodbyes, a sky seeping honey and salt. It’s pinch, blink, smile, turn. It is the summer ahead like an overripe orange. It is joy, after all.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ye-800x325.png,1
first time in cdmx,Aiden H. '28,3,2025-08-15T00:00:00-04:00,"Last week, I left the country for the first time! This was really important to me for a couple of reasons:

- I had a premonition that I was never going to leave the country. I always get this before I travel anywhere (e.g. “I’m not actually gonna get there tomorrow because something–a storm, tornado, 
        international pandemic
      
–will stop this trip from happening), so actually leaving and having a life outside of what I’ve always known get realized was really striking.

- I was going to my dream destination! I have always wanted to go to 
        Mexico City.
      
 I love the architecture and the dense parks and the vibrant city life that is missing in the increasingly desolate and dying Midwest.

So for four-ish days my girlfriend and I went to visit my cousin who lives in the city. Here’s a photo dump/itinerary of what we did:

Monday, August 4

fly DEN -> LAX -> MEX and get obsessed with 
        Good Coffee, Great Coffee
      
 for the entire 10 hours

Tuesday, August 5

We woke up starving and went to get brunch in Condesa around Parque México, which is only like a 5 minute walk from where my cousin lives. It’s here where I got my first chilaquiles (my favorite food?) in Mexico and was giddy the whole time.

From there, the main activity/sight of the day was Coyoacán, a neighborhood on the southwest side of the city famous for dense markets and Frida Kahlo’s house. They were pretty strict about taking photos inside of the house, but it was definitely pretty. I always get weird in museums, so a part of me did have a existential moment about how these international icons and forever-important historical figures literally slept in the room I was standing in, but I would argue this adds to the ambiance.

After stalking around Coyoacán for a couple of hours, we went back north to eat dinner at Ling Ling, which, as much as I hate to admit, was a TikTok recommendation that was really good. It’s a Japanese fusion restaurant on the 56th floor of a building overlooking the city to one side and Chapultepec park on the other.

Wednesday, August 6

Wednesday was everything Chapultepec park: the castle (which is apparently the only castle in North America to ever hold royalty), the anthropology museum, and just walking around the forest.

Chapultepec Castle was genuinely the coolest thing I have ever been to in my life. You have to hike about 10 minutes up a cobblestone path and are greeted by castle grounds with multiple (multiple!) live string quartets and pianists playing as you walk around the museum.

After spending hours in Chapultepec, we speed-walked around the park into the northern neighborhood of Polanco to binge eat tacos, quesadillas, and churros at a taqueria. From there, we walked back over the anthropology museum.

The anthropology museum is incredible and very good for anthropology-people, but I am not one and by this point in the trip we had already walked like 40,000 steps, so we wrapped up slightly faster than expected to go eat and pass out.

Thursday, August 7

This was our last full day, so we tried to pack in a lot. The most important thing we still hadn’t done was the most touristy–Zócalo and the historic center of the city. First we went to Palacio de Bellas Artes which has the most stunning architecture I’ve ever witnessed:

From there we went and had lunch (I got enchiladas!) and then went to the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Aztec ruins, and then the National Art Museum.

We spent the rest of the night packing and going out to eat with my cousin, so that’s a wrap!

Friday, August 8

monday, but in reverse

***

Overall, I absolutely loved my time and feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to go, but I definitely feel like there is so much to do left in the city. We didn’t have the chance to travel right outside the city to take a hot air balloon ride over the ancient pyramids, or visit most of the East side of town. I hope to go back next summer for a couple days, if not before.

Aside from the sightseeing, the trip provided a lot of epiphanies I would be remorseful if I didn’t share:

- This is a very very very privileged epiphany to have, but being in a country for the first time where 
        I do not speak the language fluently
      
 was enlightening. Obviously I knew going into the experience that it would be difficult, and I feel fairly open-minded and empathetic about the struggles of immigrants, but truly experiencing it (even from the privilege of being on vacation and not having to figure out immigration processes or government systems) was very eye-opening and an experience I think everyone should have.

- I’ve never felt more White. I am technically half-White on my mom’s side, and quarter-Mexican/quarter-Lebanese on my dad’s, so I’ve always been fairly ethnically ambiguous. Being in Mexico, which I legally and biologically am a recent descendant of, really forced the return of a long-standing struggle I’ve had as someone who is to a certain extent non-White, but am soooo White-washed. I grew up entirely with my White family in a White neighborhood as White-passing only learning Spanish in a classroom–there is absolutely no world in which I could start to compare my experiences to those who are viewed and treated as non-White. Yet a part of me also feels a pull to this other side. When I’m with my dad and his family, I “pass” as non-White with them. I visited my wella in Kansas a week before I went to Mexico, and was suddenly thrust from the White world I largely live in back into my “familial roots” of Mexico. We played lotería and ate enchiladas and sopa de fideo as wello told us in Spanish again about how he walked across the border as a kid. I can speak slow Spanish to my grandparents and feel very comfortable with my ability to read or write, but have too much anxiety and lack of experience to really talk and comprehend in Mexico–another reminder that I’m only Mexican on paper and not in actuality. To what extent are these experience valid? Is it part of my “culture” (whatever that really means), or just little stories I have dotted throughout my life about people around me who aren’t White. On paper, legal documents, and even in MIT’s systems, I am not listed as “White”, but “Hispanic/Latino”. In person, I would tell you that I’m White with a little question in my voice. It feels wrong to identify with a people and language and culture and struggle that I don’t know, but it also feels wrong to completely reject it to.

- Mexican food is the best and nothing beats it.

Hasta luego!

The Courage to Change,Kayode D. '27,14,2025-08-11T00:00:00-04:00,"Last summer, I got into running. And it was really fun! I enjoyed it a lot! So much so that when my friend offered me her ticket for the Cambridge Half marathon last fall, I accepted. But first, I went on a run through Boston and tried to run to the airport [ 
        THIS WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA DON’T TRY THIS IT”S IMPOSSIBLE 
      
 ]. I never ended up running the race after that. I did ended up writing a blog about it all, though.

This summer, I wanted to get back into running. I’ve been on break for too long, and it’s time to get back at it. So among a bunch of other goals, I told 
        myself
      
 that I was going to run a half marathon by the end of the summer. 

But that didn’t end up happening. My friend, Paul I. ‘24 recently told me that I don’t keep my word. And that’s no shade to him at all! He told me that I say I’m going to do a lot of things, but don’t follow through. I reflected on myself and realized that he’s right. I have no trouble coming up with cool ideas but my execution is not there. I have SO MANY ideas for projects and blogs and things I want to do with my life, but I am not seeing any sustainable progress towards those goals. And most of that comes from never starting. And that sucks.

…

Growing up, my family played a lot of board games. During covid we would play a full game of monopoly every night for weeks. You heard me right, a full game. Of MONOPOLY. Every night. And sometimes when I was losing I would get upset. But my dad would just repeat the same thing over and over: “Change your strategy.” If my brilliant plan wasn’t working, then why not switch directions? The only thing worse than beating a dead horse is betting on one, so why keep putting your hope in something that isn’t working? Sure, it could magically start working next turn and you could win it all. But it hasn’t magically worked so far, and it hasn’t magically worked any of the other nights, either. So what’s so different about tonight?

I realized that I needed to change my strategy. I’m trying to magically will myself to change, like somehow I’ll wake up tomorrow and just have the motivation and mojo to do everything I’ve ever dreamed of. But that’s a bad strategy– I would know, it hasn’t worked for me yet. 

So now I know I need to make a change. But how? How do I get out of this rut of overthinking and spinning a wheel in place and actually start moving towards my goal?

Go to someone stronger than me. 

 

Part 2: The Piano Analogy

I struggle with asking for help. It’s something I’ve been working on, but it’s still hard. I feel like I should be strong enough to get things done on my own, and I shouldn’t need help. In reality, I do just OK and refuse help belligerently.

One time I was asked what wish I would make if I had a genie. What immediately came to mind was something I’ve been wishing for a long time: That I would wake up tomorrow and magically know how to play the piano beautifully. Any song I could think of, just like that. 
        I feel
      
 like I can speak through drumming, like there is no buffer between idea and actualization, and 
        I want to be able to do that on piano.
      


But as I told my friend this wish I had, I realized what I was missing out on. I was skipping all of the hard work. Yes, it sucks. And it’s hard. And it’s not always fun. But nothing worth doing is easy. If I woke up tomorrow and just knew how to play piano magically, I would only be cheating myself on what makes piano worth playing! It being hard is what makes it fun to do. So I don’t want to just know it all instantly, 
        I want to work for it.
      


But recently I saw a second side to this analogy. If I have turned down this offer for instant magical piano skills, I am now sitting at a piano, trudging through learning to play. A friend or mentor comes up to me at my little piano and says “Kayode! I see you’re learning piano. You’re struggling a little bit. Here, let me teach you what I know.” I reply, “No! If I take handouts from people like you, I’m cheating myself out of the experience of learning! I need to grow on my own!” 

And doesn’t that sound so stupid? The book of Proverbs, chapter 12 was literally written for people like me: “Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid… the way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.” 

And I hear this and I say “That’s harsh, isn’t it?” But that’s the truth! Time and again, I try to do things–not just playing music, but even living life– without any help from those around me. I try to do it all by myself, as if that proves I am capable of doing it all on my own, when I don’t think that’s the lesson I need to be learning. It hasn’t worked for me yet. 

 

Part 3: Enter B-Dawg

My friend, Brendan, is a BEAST. We grew up together, and I knew he was the perfect person to ask for help. I told him about my running aspirations and my fears with so little of the summer left. He got really excited and we signed up for a more manageable race: a 10k. 

At first I thought this was lame. Why not go for the gold and do the half marathon? Maybe because I have never run in a real race ever and needed a benchmark to actually see my efforts actualize? I started running every night, and eventually was able to run 4 miles in a go. I got this in the bag.

My big running song this summer has been “Baseball Card” by Worthikids. I’m on the rise. 

As we prepared to run over the next few weeks, Brendan told me he was going to stick with my pace, and that we weren’t going to stop. We were going to finish this thing. 

 

And we did! 

Haha, he never let me stop the entire time. We ran or jogged or walked for a bit, but we did the whole thing without stopping. We ended with a time of 1:12:00, which is pretty good, I’d say! Better than never running at all, at least. 

I walked and he encouraged me, and we ended up running a full 10k! I ate like 5 bananas when it was over. Brendan told me that I would want to run another one in two weeks, and I did NOT believe him. But now it’s been two weeks…and lowkey kinda yeah. I could do that again. Whatever, man, I’m learning that when I’m wrong about something it’s not the end of the world. 

 I think i don’t like strava. I mean I don’t really know what any of these numbers mean in a greater context, but i don’t need to know them. It’s just for what little clout i could garner with an 11:13 10k, haha

Tough Mudder?

After getting home, my dad told me that I should join him the NEXT weekend for the Tough Mudder. 

If you don’t know what that is, It’s like a 5k through the woods and mud, and there’s all these obstacles along the way. There are walls to climb and trenches to crawl through, and even an electric barbed wire. This is the kind of thing that band nerd Kayode would have noped RIGHT OUT OF in high school. But if I could run a 10k, I could run half of that where I’m allowed to stop at obstacles. And so I did. 

 

Tough Mudder!!!

This thing was literally a blast. It was in my old hometown in Columbus Indiana, and was like summer camp and survivor mixed into one. A grand old time. I did it with my dad, brother, Brendan, and some other people from my church, and for the first time in literally my entire life, I felt athletic. I know that’s such a dorky thing to say, but I’ve always thought of myself as a band nerd who was bad at sports and anything athletic. That was just a mental jail! I could’ve been doing stuff like this the whole time!!

I texted The Boys right after and said we are 10,000% running a Tough Mudder this semester. Although, there aren’t any slated for this fall, there is a spartan race in FENWAY PARK this fall, so I might try to do that.

So the moral of the story

If you can’t find the courage to change, ask someone for help. I know I needed it, and I still need it now. I have soooooooooo many things I want to do, and so many blogs that I want to write. But I’m so obsessed with being perfect that I can’t even bring myself to write them. I’m sure someone out there wants to read about how Cru has been at MIT this last year, or how I placed SECOND at the MIT 2.007 competition, or maybe somebody wants to see Minesweeper Monday Episode 3…but probably not. No one ever asks me when it’s coming out or anything like that. 

But that’s my goal with this blog, and this school year. To keep my word. And I don’t mean with the precision of a diamond encrusted plasma cutter. Just something–anything– to get moving.

So that’s what this blog is. I know my dad will say that this blog is too long, haha, but I needed to write it. Because until I start, I’ll never get anywhere. 

When I used to get art journals in school, I would scribble all over the first page to break any idea that this journal had to be perfect. I would get so scared of making a bad drawing that I would never make anything. I was afraid of failure. 

No more! No more trying to be perfect! We’re making a lot of mistakes this year so we learn and get better!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/strava-running.png

"[Guest Post] Because Racecar, Friendships, and Family",Gloria Z. '26,7,2025-07-31T00:00:00-04:00,"This is a blog by Monica C. ‘25 about her experience on the MIT Formula SAE team! Eight years ago, her brother, Kevin C. ‘17, wrote a guest post of his own about his time on the team, so now we’re bringing it full circle 😊. You can learn more about the team at https://fsae.mit.edu/.

Background and Introduction

I’m Monica C., an M.Eng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (6-2), and I wanted to write a blog about MIT Motorsports, a team that builds, designs, and competes a Formula style electric passenger racecar. Each year we build a new racecar from scratch, starting from the design stage to two annual competitions in May and June, where we race against colleges across the nation in the Formula SAE competition series. Our team consists of around 80 people now, divided into Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, Autonomous, and Business. 

I’m the Software and Autonomous Engineering Lead, which means I am responsible for what I like to call “the soul of the car”: custom PCB low level firmware, data acquisition and telemetry, controls algorithms, and our very first autonomous driving system.

The Cool Stuff™

Our team has been around since 2001, and we started building electric vehicles in 2014. This year we’ve built our first 4 wheel drive vehicle, a major advancement in our team knowledge and technical prowess. This year is the largest technical jump we’ve made in my time on the team, requiring us to learn how to build a custom gearbox, our 550-Volt custom battery, controls algorithms for torque vectoring, and decoupled suspension. Our car’s 
        0-60
      
 is 2.5 seconds, and we placed 9th at our most recent competition out of 90 teams. Our team is also developing our first driverless racecar. But none of this would be possible if we didn’t love the team we were on.

 

Being in Motorsports has taught me a lot about the engineering process, but more importantly, it’s taught me what it takes to work on a cross-functional team.

What I’ve learned as an engineer

My advice boils down to: anything worthwhile building is hard, no one is going to have all the answers. Just go for it. 

1) To be a good software engineer, you must first be a good engineer.

During my time at MIT, especially in the 
        EECS
      
 department, I’ve noticed that it’s easy to get funneled into one specific kind of software engineering role: building software products for software companies. I’ve heard classmates complain about there not being enough classes that teach you frontend/backend development or more practical skills that are used day to day in the industry. I think the real point of MIT isn’t to learn how to use specific tools, it’s to teach you how to think.

Through my work at MIT Motorsports, I’ve realized that software engineers can do much more, particularly when working on hardware-focused teams.

Being a software engineer in a hardware-heavy project is a unique experience. You’re not just writing code. You’re responsible for understanding mechanical and electrical systems you didn’t design, figuring out how different components interface and communicate, and often connecting all the pieces together. You spend time reading datasheets to understand sensor limitations, learning how signals propagate, and solving problems that span both hardware and software.

For example, from February to March, the 
        EE
      
 and software teams push to test our electrical system off the car by placing all our boards on a table and wiring them together for a full integration test. We call this process “EE on Bench,” where the final goal is to spin the motors that power the car with our custom battery. During that time, the software is actually mostly written, so I spend most of my time helping with assembly. I help make the wiring harnesses, assemble the boxes, and do full integration tests with the help from the electrical team.

EE On Bench Assembly: the box in the middle is our main low voltage components. This was the first time we saw everything in the boxes fully packaged, hence Marissa L. ‘26 ‘s enthused expression.

This is our main car controller PCB that we design ourselves! Most of the software runs on this tiny 4 inch compact setup.

To write good software, you need to understand the design requirements and constraints. What components does the software interface with? Who is going to be using the code, and what is their skill set? What are the latency, memory, and power design requirements?

These are engineering questions. They are unrelated to writing code and syntax, but they shape your end product. Knowing how register timing works or how to use specific Python libraries helps with implementation. But writing good and useful software requires thinking carefully about integration, usability, and trade-offs; problems that engineers solve no matter their discipline. As a CS or EECS student, it’s often easy to lose sight of those values when hung up day to day in the implementation details and debugging code. Most importantly, I’ve realized how easy it is to get caught up writing code without asking yourself why am I writing this? I think the boom of the software and artificial intelligence era has encouraged people to learn how to code, but software engineers need to learn how to design. 

That is why to be a good software engineer, you must first be a good engineer.

2) Learn on the job

Nobody tells you how to build a driverless racecar. There’s no book with step by step instructions, lecture slides, or professors that have 20+ years of experience that are advising you. Formula SAE is a crash course on being pushed off the edge of a cliff and learning how to fly.

When I decided this year to build an autonomous subteam, I realized a lot of it was thinking about how in class we’d learn a lot about perception, motion planning, and controls, but how few opportunities there were to put all those concepts in practice. I wanted to create a team who wanted to learn how to build an autonomous car by building one. The autonomous team consists this year of 10 software engineers who, together, have learned about many different fields, including optics, motion planning, and even fundraising :).

None of us are AI experts; many of the autonomous team are freshmen who hadn’t even taken introduction to machine learning yet. But what I was selecting during recruiting were team members who were willing to take the risk and get their hands dirty.

3) You’re just as capable now as you will be 2 years from now

Before I entered MIT, and even as I started as an undergraduate, I really looked up to the juniors and seniors on the team or in my classes who seemed so sure of themselves and to me, so much smarter. But now that I myself am a senior about to graduate I realized that they probably didn’t know that much more than me. They learned it all themselves. My best mentors didn’t really teach me any step by step processes. They instead gave me projects and the emotional encouragement that I could do it.

Transitioning from student to engineer requires starting to make your own design decisions and advocating for your own system. The best engineers I’ve met have a common trait: they’re not afraid to ask questions or look like they don’t understand something. That’s how they learn.

4) Making mistakes is how you learn

I think there are limits to this statement that are vaguely in the realm of “move fast and break things.” But generally speaking, I’ve seen too many student-run teams or startups fail because they aren’t decisive enough. They spend months in the “kickoff” phase of a project or idea and never commit to the first decisions, first purchases. Building anything worthwhile has its risks, and part of what I learned during my time in college is to stop being afraid of making mistakes. I purchased the wrong type of ethernet hub 4 or 5 times, and then we realized we didn’t even need it since we discovered we needed a hardware trigger for our cameras. But how would we have discovered that if we never tried? 

What I’ve learned as a friend and teammate

1) For the project to excel, the team must excel

From years that were more of a struggle, we learned that the team has to work well together in order to build a good car. Those years showed the younger generation on the team the vital importance of putting the team first before the car. When I say a good team, I don’t mean technically excellent; I mean a team that is capable of working together as a unit. 

Therefore, since then, we focused a lot on building the team. Focusing on things like team bonding, trips, and just having fun in the workshop. We go on an annual ski trip, retreats, and competitions together! Throughout the year, we eat dinner together multiple times a week, watch Formula 1 races together in our shop, and have social events including mixers with other build teams and movie nights. If the team likes being around each other, they will enjoy working together to build the car. 

Ultimately, if the team doesn’t like working together, the project won’t get done. Once we learned that, we built the best car in our team history in 2025.

2) Empathy is the most important quality for a teammate

Sometimes all that people want is someone to listen to their concerns. On a team where you work 40+ hours a week, it is natural that disagreements come up, and we are not perfect people. As a leader, I’ve noticed that the most important thing is to listen. This might seem obvious, but I’ve had to learn how to be a good listener. I’ve come to realize that empathy, that is deeply feeling and understanding people’s feelings, has a few components:

- Why: Get to the root of what is causing people to feel the way they do. This is the most important part. Sometimes people just want to voice their concern but don’t necessarily have a good plan for how to handle it, which is why they come to you for help. Emotional support and validation is the most important aspect of this. 

- How: Understand whether there are concrete actionables to resolve the problem. People feel the way they do based on what has been occurring around them. Are there actions that are currently hurting them? Is there a better way we can support them? 

- Follow up: Listening isn’t just a one time thing. It’s important to follow up in the weeks or even months after to re-evaluate the plan. 

3) Sometimes the best thing to do is to go to bed (or go get boba)

When people are working super hard and it gets late at night, there’s something like sunk cost fallacy that occurs and people just keep bashing their head debugging instead of going home. Problems often look better in the morning with a fresh mind, as hard as it is to stop working when you’ve invested so much time. Going to bed early sets you up for a better attempt the next day. 

One perk of working on Motorsports is that we have a boba shop and ice cream store right down the street. We often take breaks to go walk there and get a sweet treat when things aren’t working as we expect. We also have a playlist that we listen to throughout our late nights working together, which I will attach here:

Family

Eight years ago, my older brother Kevin Chan ‘17 M.Eng ‘18 wrote Because Racecar and it’s fun to reflect on how much has changed:

“While our team can only dream about carbon fiber monocoques, four-wheel drive systems with in-hub motors, and semi-active suspensions…”

I’m proud to say that our Model Year 2025 car features our first four-wheel drive vehicle with in hub motors. This car also features our first decoupled roll-heave suspension. My whole family made it out for my last competition this year!

My dad and mom, Eric ‘85 and Mary, raised both of us to have a deep love for problem solving and engineering. In many ways, Formula SAE is a dream our family came up with together, albeit indirectly. My parents raised us to be able to fix our own bicycles and cars, to help around the house with maintenance, and encouraged us to pursue whatever silly things we wanted to build. None of them were even phased when I told them I started building a driverless car.

Me, my dad ‘85, my brother ‘17 MEng ‘18, and my mom at our June 2025 competition! Kevin was a design judge for the competition this year.

Purpose

Some people ask me, “why do you do this to yourself?”

They ask me this because it’s hard to believe an MIT student would spend 40 hours a week doing anything except their schoolwork. When the nights are long and the car is not working, I often ask myself this question.

Sunset in Michigan on the last day of our competition. It was so surreal to be surrounded by so much rural landscape when we’re used to the hustle and bustle of Cambridge.

One of my favorite feelings is when we’re out on the track testing. If you close your eyes, you can hear the sounds of the car, which often indicate to you how the car is operating, how much the driver is slipping, whether any components are interfering. Often, listening to the car will tell you more than seeing it. You can hear everything working together, the cooling, the controls, the drivetrain, etc. I get a moment to process that wow. We built that car.

But if you listen a little closer, you hear the laughter from the team watching the car that we built driving around. “Woah, I can’t believe it! It’s going so fast! It sounds so good!” I can hear my teammates pacing around, watching the car closely. 

On one hand, you have the car, a physical manifestation of our work as engineers and the countless hours poured into it. On the other, you have the people, joy, and friendship that was required to get there. For me, MIT Motorsports is a combination of all the things I love most about being at MIT. Working with incredibly talented engineers and scientists to build something cool, partly for fun, partly because of the challenge.  

But mostly, it’s because we love what we do and who we do it with.

MIT is a hard place, as any student at Tech knows. Some days are hard to get through and understand why we put ourselves through it. I used to think my dreams would get smaller after I achieved what seemed a lofty dream of attending MIT. But to my dismay, my dreams only got bigger. And on the days that are hard, as there are many, I am guided by the people around me, my team. 

The most important lesson that I’ve learned through my time at MIT is that we build things to attain the craft and scientific prowess, but anything worth building takes a village. You need the right village to build a fast racecar. Technical knowledge allows you to accomplish your goal, but people provide the purpose.

[Guest Post] Take Me *Home* to the Ballgame,Nicole Cooper,1,2025-07-31T00:00:00-04:00,"Of all the things to happen in college, I never expected baseball to become the antidote to my homesickness.

I’ve always been a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals—it was practically a requirement to live in the small town I grew up in. But it actually wasn’t until I left Missouri for college that I started following the team as closely as I do today. It’s no coincidence that was also when I started to feel homesick. I was no stranger to being away from home and my family at that point, since I’d gone to overnight camps during my summers for up to three weeks at a time. But something about college felt different.

My brother and I at a baseball game as kids

Suddenly, the end date for my stay was years away instead of days or weeks. College was supposed to be my new home, but it was so different from the one I left behind. It was so much bigger, so much busier, so much louder. And no one I knew was there to go through it with me. When my mom left to drive home (yes, all 1200 miles back to Missouri) after my freshman orientation, I broke down crying.

Despite the homesickness, there wasn’t a single moment when I regretted coming to MIT or wished I’d chosen a different college. I knew MIT was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up and that being here was the right thing for me, even if it was unfortunately far from home. Thankfully, over time I learned how to manage the homesickness. I joined clubs where I was able to find a great community of friends. Knowing I had friends I could lean on helped make this place feel more like a home and less like a temporary stop along the way. But another factor that helped me feel more settled was keeping that connection to my hometown, knowing that just because I’d left my home didn’t mean I’d lost it. And I was able to do that through baseball.

Because when I close my eyes, I’m back in the car with my dad, listening to the game on the radio as he drives me back and forth between scholar bowl (think team trivia on steroids), tennis tournaments, and math competitions. I’m back in my grandparents’ house, the game on the TV as we complain about all the decisions we would make differently if we were managing the team. I’m back at weekly dinners with my extended family at Culver’s (if you know you know), the ballgame playing in the background.

My dad visiting Fenway Park for the first time for a very rainy (and cold) game between the Cardinals and Red Sox!

Maybe you hate baseball (in which case I’d argue you just don’t get it, but that’s a conversation for another time). But whatever it is that connects you to your home, hold onto it. Let it get you through the homesickness, through the times you feel displaced, through the times you just need some sort of comfort. Because those times likely will come—especially if you’re from far away or an environment very different from the city atmosphere of Boston—but they’ll be easier to manage if you have that connection to your hometown to ground you.

After all, college may take you far from home, but it doesn’t have to take home from you.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-10.23.03%E2%80%AFAM-1000x740.png

"Robots, Space, and the Stories In-Between",Richard O. '28,8,2025-07-30T00:00:00-04:00,"One thing about me is I love science fiction. Whether it be movies, books, shows, or short stories, science fiction always gives me an opportunity to imagine life in a world different than ours and envision what future technology and future societies can look like. I actually talked a little about my science fiction obsession in my MIT applications since sci-fi is part of where I get my inspiration for wanting to be a part of the computer science world. That being said, I’ve found myself indulging and catching up on a lot of science fiction shows that I’ve been saving up during the school year in between my work hours this summer and decided to share a few of my many, many favorites:

Foundation

Richie Rating: 10⁹/10

Current Status: Finished/Caught Up

Concepts/Themes: Interplanetary Conflicts, Future Societies, Government, Corruption, Time Travel, Math, Technology, Ethics, Cloning, Artificial Intelligence, Space

Richie Analysis: If Star Wars and Dune had a baby, Foundation would be the child. This show is the pinnacle of what science fiction shows should look like. Cinematic production, intriguing storyline, and amazing acting all while bridging together so many different science and space concepts into one beautifully executed show. Basically, some super smart math professor predicts that the entire galaxy is about to enter into a state of chaos for several thousand years but is exiled for his predictions by the sitting empire and tries to gather people to fix things himself. It’s based off of an original novel series by Isaac Asimov with the same name that I have yet to read so I can’t really compare the accuracy of the adaptation, but either way this show is so amazingly well done. Getting to the end of episode 1 is all you need to be hooked on.

Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4QYV5GTz7c

Pluto

Richie Rating: 10/10

Current Status: Finished/Caught Up

Concepts/Themes: Artificial Intelligence, Robots, War, Investigation, Emotions, Corruption

Richie Analysis: A beautifully written Japanese animated short series about an investigation into the death of several artificially intelligent robots that exist in a world where AI has reached the same level of intellect as humans. From AI ethics and politics to war and grief, this series has so many amazing layers and character lines that tie into one overarching story that really makes you contemplate a lot of different societal topics. It’s been a while since I’ve watched this, so the trailer below can give a better explanation as to what it entails.

Invasion

Richie Rating: 9.8/10

Current Status: Finished/Caught Up

Concepts/Themes: Apocalypse, Survival, Future Technology, Military, Alien Communication, International Cooperation, Family, Friendships

Richie Analysis: Best apocalyptic sci-fi show out there. Essentially a colony of extraterrestrial creatures start overtaking earth and the show follows several different stories of characters all across the globe experiencing the same conflict and slowly begins to merge all their stories together. Lots of foreshadowing, political disputes, ethical discussions and conflict.

Lost in Space

Richie Rating: 9.5/10

Current Status: Been a while/Need to rewatch

Concepts/Themes: Robots, Space Exploration, Planetary Colonization, Problem Solving, Survival, Family, Friendships, Social Dynamics, Trust

Richie Commentary: Man it’s been so long since I’ve watched this one, but this show is what got me obsessed with space exploration shows. Used to watch it with my family and just remember being in awe after each episode. From what I remember the show follows a family on a ship on course to a planet in the Alpha Centauri star system but ends up getting marooned on another planet after their main ship gets damaged. Main character, Will Robinson, meets an AI robot and the show follows the family’s experiences as they try to return to their intended planet. Trailer below will give better details.

The Sand Man

Richie Rating: 9.5/10

Current Status: In progress (on ep7 of s2)

Concepts/Themes: Reality, Life, Death, Dreams, Greek Mythology, Ethics, Responsibility, Promises, Trust, Family, Relationships, Morals

Richie Commentary: Cinematic masterpiece. More of a magical fantasy-based show but is so beautifully produced that it deserves a spot up here. Main character is called Dream, and he essentially controls the dreams of humanity. But on top of that he has a lot of interesting relationships with people in the human world and outside of the human world. A lot of interplay between different mythologies such as Greek and Norse. Most episodes focus on a main plot but some of the more intriguing episodes drift away from it and focus on side characters

Scavenger’s Reign

Richie Rating: 9/10

Current Status: In progress (on ep 8)

Concepts/Themes: Space Exploration, Survival, Trust, Nature, Artificial Intelligence, Conflict

Richie Analysis: A beautiful animated series about several people who get deserted on a unique planet after using escape pods to get off of their damaged freighter ship. Some of these survivors get separated and the show follows each of their experiences on this planet that is home to some odd and interesting creatures and plants and how they adapt using the foreign life forms they encounter to survive.

Interstellar

Richie Rating: 9/10

Current Status: Been a while/Need to rewatch

Concepts/Themes: Space Exploration, Family, Trust, Decisions, Time, Reality

Richie Analysis: You should probably have heard of this movie by now. Anyways: a great story about a dad who goes up into space to get data on some viable alternatives for humanity to replace Earth with after their society began experiencing a mass food shortage. While in space he experiences some drastic time dilation due to different space phenomena, and the movie basically follows the experiences he has as well as those on earth (including his daughter) who experience time a lot faster than him.

Concepts/Themes: Space Race, NASA, Moon and Mars Exploration, Relationships, Family, Government, Conflict, Decisions, Trauma

Richie Analysis: A well written alternate retelling of the space race between the US and the Soviet Union during the latter half of the 1900s. Imagines a world where the Soviet Union set foot on the moon first and what the start of a mars race would look like. Really amazing show.

Richie Rating: 8/10

Current Status: Been a while/Need to rewatch

Concepts/Themes: Moon Colonization, Climate Change, Scientific Discovery, Catastrophes, Trust, Mysteries

Richie Analysis: Loved this show. Essentially, earth began experiencing a water shortage due to climate change so several scientists are sent up to retrieve a sample of something that could help address it on an abandoned lunar base that experienced some sort of catastrophic event and bring the sample back to earth. Lots of suspense. Lots of mysteries. Great story. Watched this 3 years ago with my dad and brother and sadly still have yet to hear about a season 2.

Concepts/Themes: Artificial Intelligence, Alien Societies, Friendships, Government, Scientific Advancements, Ethics

Richie Analysis: Honestly just a very…random show. Essentially there’s an intelligent species coming to earth and a ton of random phenomena start happening. And then the intelligent species send these weird VR goggles and start manipulating people’s visions and then manipulating people and then technology and yea. It’s just a crazy show. Lots of cool future technology ideas tied in, so definitely worth a watch.

Dune I & II:

Richie Rating: 7/10

Current Status: Been a while/Need to rewatch

Concepts/Themes: Interplanetary Governments, Resource Acquisition, Family, Prophecy, Love, Survival, Conflict

Richie Analysis: I’m gonna be honest – when I watched both Dune movies I was barely paying attention to the plot and was honestly just fangirling over the visual effects, world designs, and camera work. So, yea I’m not even gonna try to tell you what it’s even about cause I honestly barely remember, so I’ll let the trailers do the talking and will probably rewatch for the plot whenever Dune III comes out.

Richie Rating: 7\10

Current Status: Complete/Caught Up

Concepts/Themes: Space Travel, Artificial Intelligence, Alien Interaction, Interplanetary Travel, Space Phenomena, Survival, Family, Cryogenic Sleep

Richie Analysis: Mmmmm. This show was alright. Watched the first season with my dad like 2 years ago. Ending of the first season made my jaw drop and I realized like a month ago that they made a second season so I finished watching that. But basically, some aliens leave an artifact on earth so a crew is put together to investigate and follow a signal it produces in hopes that they will uncover its origin. Pretty decent space travel show that shows you all the things that can go wrong in space though the second season was kind of meh.

Severance

Richie Rating: 6.8/10

Current Status: In progress (ep5 of s1)

Concepts/Themes: Corporate Society, Memory Auditing, Family, Life Choices, Consciousness, Emotions

Richie Analysis: Unique show that follows these people who opt-in to a procedure at an office for a corporation called Lumon that basically makes them forget all their work memories when they leave the office and all their personal life memories when they re-enter the office. This essentially forces the workers to live two different lives. Interesting show that I think I need to keep watching.

Richie Rating: 6.5/10

Current Status: Complete/Caught Up

Concepts/Themes: Survival, Cloning, Extraterrestrial Life, Corruption, Power, Politics

Richie Analysis: Movie about a guy who signs up to join a spaceship crew and work as an “Expendable” or disposable human worker that gets reprinted with the same memories every time he dies. Think I might’ve liked this more as a show because the whole story felt like it could’ve been slower, but it was a decent watch.

my hottest STEM takes,Aiden H. '28,25,2025-07-28T00:00:00-04:00,"I famously have perfect taste, and with little to do over the summer, I’m left to just sit around and ponder endlessly, refining my taste and opinions indefinitely.

I offer you the following takes with limited to no explanation. Feel free to argue in the comments…I’m ready to defend.

1. Proofs are boring

Don’t you dare show me a mathematical proof. If I care that much, I’ll have the internet explain it to me like I’m five. 90% of things I’m learning very much can be explained in simple words or with common logic. Who is asking to read LaTeX and then going “let’s show this to other people–it makes a lot of sense”?

I’m not saying we shouldn’t have mathematical proofs, I’m just saying that these should not be the ways in which I’m learning something. It should be merely a formality on the way to making something common knowledge.

I choose not to concern myself with the “jth particle” or “nth term”.

I choose happiness.

2. 
        Course 16
      
 is just 
        Course 2
      


This is mostly just out of ignorance, but isn’t 16 just specialized 2? You just do plane mechanics. Also what is mechanical engineering?

3. Organic Chemistry is a great class

Loved it.

4. Pie Charts are good

It is such a valid way to present information, especially demographics and any classification.

5. Φ is pronounced fi, not fee

Why when talking about greek life everyone agrees it’s fi, and then suddenly in physics y’all are switching sides and saying fee.

6. Always put spaces in code

Readability > typing “efficiency” in every case



On that note…

7. I’m not using recursion unless it’s by accident

If I just so happen to have my natural, logical instincts be recursive, then I will write the code that way. I will not sit there thinking about time complexity and memory storage yada yada and drawing a little recursive path on a piece of paper.

If it’s that serious then it either a) has to be done with recursion, so lectures/tutorials/the internet will tell me how or b) it will be edited by ChatGPT to be recursive.

Also I thought recursion was bad-ish.

8. Golgi is pronounced goal-g, not goal-guy

Do NOT disrespect the apparatus like that

9. Mendel’s Laws Are Awfully Named

“Segregation” is a type of “assortment” and it notably has an “independent” nature to it such that the alleles are “segregated” “independently”.

It should just be gametes vs daughter cells.

10. The number 7 should always have a dash when handwritten

11. Matrices are brackets not parentheses

cmon you know what’s right

12. Lim has a cursive l, ln has a print l

Last but not least (if not most important)…

13. Math is blue

science is green, english is yellow, and social studies is red fight me byeee","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-5.23.45%E2%80%AFPM.png

My design won an MIT merch contest,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",7,2025-07-23T00:00:00-04:00,"Author’s note: The original title was going to be “I DUPED THE COOP!” but I decided that was too much. I still wanted to mention it though.

 

Back in March, the Harvard/MIT Coop announced their very first merch design competition for the graduating Class of 2025 (that’s me!). Four winners were going to be picked overall, with one undergrad and one grad student from each university. Each of the winners is going to win $500, and four finalists were going to win $100. The objective was to “craft bold, memorable designs that capture the unique spirit of the Class of 2025.”

I’ve thought about making custom merch since freshman year, but I’ve just been too lazy to start. So when I got the email from the Coop, I knew it was my calling. This was the universe telling me to go for it and make my dreams come true.

What I submitted

Under the “What inspired you to draw your design” question in the submission form, I wrote some bullshit about how I wanted to capture the complexities of the Class of 2025 experience: coming out of the COVID lockdown and right into college, not knowing what to do after graduation, realizing that your friends are moving away, waiting for grad school decisions, etc.

I wrote all that because it’d be funny to write a serious justification for whatever the heck this was supposed to be. I didn’t expect to win; that wasn’t really my goal. All I wanted was to make somebody on the judges’ panel laugh, or at least mutter a perplexed “…what?”

Turns out, I’m not the only one with an odd taste in graphic design.



I got this email in the middle of a media studies class I was taking. I had to excuse myself to go the restroom so I wouldn’t interrupt the class discussion about online privacy with my idiotic laughter.

Mind you, the Harvard/MIT Coop sells official Harvard/MIT merchandise. Visitors from all over the world come into their stores, so I’d imagine it’s important for them to capture the essence of their respective universities. But now, the MIT Coop had to figure out how to publicize this neurotic rat-animal-thing along with their usual selection of merch. Boy, they tried.

When I went to pick up my $500 check, I expected them to go “haha SIKE!” and then laugh me out of the building. Nothing happened, and I successfully deposited my check. That money probably came from an innocent alum who thought they were supporting a library or something meaningful like that. It found its way into my hands instead, and a week later I spent a part of it on GTA IV.

I really want to know what the judges were thinking when they made me a winner. Did they not get enough submissions? Did they want to prank the Board of Directors and the general public? Or did they see something in this vulnerable and anxious creature that they resonated with?

To be fair, I wasn’t entirely lying in the submission form. I’ve tried writing a senior year post that would wrap up my personal college experience, but every attempt ends up going on and on about how I should’ve done things differently. I guess I’m not alone in this post-graduation ambivalence though, because whenever I showed this drawing to my friends, they would say something like “IT’S BEAUTIFUL” but then end with “God, I feel that though.”

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve also made fond memories at MIT. However, it can feel disappointing to not get the story-book college experience that I hoped for. But this is one of those fond memories, and I get to brag that I designed official MIT merch. Props to the Coop for taking a chance on my ugly, yet endearing, creation.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_mit_shirt-400x400.png

[liveblog] presenting at the Open Sauce maker expo!,Kanokwan T. '26,3,2025-07-20T00:00:00-04:00,"Jul 20, 2025 at 11am

My friends (Asal V. ‘25 and Isaac L. ‘25) and I built Waterscope, a microscope that uses water instead of glass for magnification. It’s cool because we can change the magnification continuously, which is impossible with glass.

At Open Sauce, the maker expo in San Mateo, we’re at booth I22. If you’re around, feel free to stop by!

It feels like we’re presenting a small town middle school science fair project. Look:

how to be a microcelebrity,Janet G. '27,5,2025-07-18T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m not very good at impulse management. In my last (real) post, I spent 
         like 15 hours writing 
      
 about the food I ate for a solid month. At the end of it, I admitted defeat:

like a bear who has stocked up on food stores from the plentiful fall, i too shall go hibernate in my cave for the winter. see y’all later

like a bear who has stocked up on food stores from the plentiful fall, i too shall go hibernate in my cave for the winter. see y’all later

… and proceeded to fall into a food coma 
         for the entire spring semester. 
      
 Anyway, spring came and went, we’re now in the middle of summer, and last night I couldn’t sleep until 3am because I hit a critical mass of a desire to write. So here I am. Hello again! 

I knew I wanted to write something, but in my flurry of thoughts last night ideas kept on popping up and getting knocked down. So as a bit of a cop-out and hopefully a new jumpstart, this blog will be about how and why you might want to blog and become the microcelebrity of your dreams. Meta, I know.

For some background, I’ve barely written anything blog-like over the past half year for a multitude of reasons, mostly enumerated below. 

- Basically all my previous blogs were pretty high-effort and image intensive, which meant that they took at least 10 hours per blog. I was, like, actually dying in the Spring semester, so I definitely didn’t have enough time to write anything of substance.

- I shopped around three 
         CI-H 
      
 classes, all of which made me write a lot, and I did not particularly feel like vomiting more words after being forced to write so much. 

- As an international student, reading the news during the spring was not an enjoyable experience. I also couldn’t stop reading the news. I was trying to figure out what I can and can’t say, and the stress was all a bit too much. 

- Aside from the blogs, I also felt tired of writing about myself. I wrote a lot over the past two years. There are a ton of blogs that I have since made private; I wrote a yearly letter that was thousands of words; I write over 100 personalised Christmas cards to my friends every year. I publicised ~80% of my writing, and this really screwed with my self perception. Will talk about this later.

- I got really insecure about writing. I felt like my writing was too fluffy, too overdramatic, too self-important. I felt like I needed to live more life and read more before I had a right to put more writing into the world. 

- Finally, I felt really weird about the collapse of meaning with the onset of AI. Did my writing mean anything anymore? Or was it just a way for the scrapers to source information about me and construct a bastardised version of myself that anyone could query ChatGPT with? 

But here I am, writing about myself on a public platform, and planning on writing more. 

Why? 

Because I think blogging is worth it, and I think maybe you should consider it too.

0) What counts as blogging?

Blogging, as I’ll define it, is about jotting down personal thoughts/takes, and then putting them out into the world via one platform or another. If you jot down personal thoughts and keep them to yourself, that’s called journaling. If you jot down something that isn’t personal thoughts and then put them out into the world, that’s like, propaganda or something. 

1) Why you might want to blog

I think there are primarily three classes of benefits that come with blogging: personal, professional, and social. 

I think personal benefits are the most important, because they stand independent of any external validation/feedback that you might get. In any case, even if you write something and you only show it to a few friends/family members, it’s worth it. These benefits also apply obviously to journalling, so if your privacy concerns are too high for you to count blogging as worth it, you should just journal instead. 

1) Blogging helps you record down experiences and thoughts for later. 

You get to remember what past you cared about; there’s also something so idyllic about recalling the ‘good old times.’ You also get to review past mistakes that you made, and try not to make them again. I love reading old diary entries for this reason — how I’d felt petty against some kid who had laughed at my lack of loom bands, the little games I played with my siblings, the first time I took the courage to go to the local dairy and buy a 2 dollar ice block. I still read the letters to my past selves over the past few years, feeling bittersweet and relieved about things that happened and did not. 

2) Blogging helps you make thoughts legible and synthesize ideas in the context of your own life. 

I think many of the MIT blogs are great examples of this: I’ll reference Aiden H. ‘28 and Allison E. ‘27’s blogs here, 
         although I know many many other bloggers have done the same. 
      
 Allison’s recent blog on life tokens captures such a lovely idea about living life to the fullest; Aiden’s blog about boringness captures a different but similarly meaningful idea about being content with what is already here. Both of them made me think a lot, and they capture these ideas in grounded little snapshots in a way that made them stick in my mind. I was not lucky enough to write those blogs, but I have had a similar case with my blog about instagram and choosing to not engage with social media. I can tell you for sure that it made me think more deeply about the life I’m living. 

Beyond these personal benefits, I think professional and social benefits are also pretty important and tend to scale up with audience.

3) Blogging helps you with articulating and communicating ideas that you otherwise might loosely understand

The Feynman Technique is a pretty famous learning technique. 
         There’s also the trick for asking questions on forums, which is that you ask a question, and then give a bad answer for it on the forum. Other people are more likely to correct a bad answer than be the first to give an answer, 
      
 so in the same way, if you write a blog on some concept, you could also get good clarifications on the ideas because you’ve put your understanding out there for other people to correct.


4) Blogging helps you meet people you resonate with! 

There’s a quote that I think is really funny, but is also really true: “everything is a dating app if you try hard enough.” Of course, I’m not saying that you should write a blog so that you can pull. You can do that if you want I guess? But the more generalisable observation is that if you think about dating apps as a way to just meet people you might like, blogs are a way for you to meet people you resonate with. You get to showcase your thoughts, and people who resonate with your thoughts might reach out, in which case new friendships and relationships (;D) just may as well bloom! Henrik Karlsson, an essayist who writes a lot about meta-blogging, has a great post about this.

5) Pleasant surprises 

Something similar but not quite identical to the previous idea is that you can get pleasant surprises. These can include interesting people, but also the occasionally cute fan-mail and old friend who texts you about a blog you write. I remember everyone who has reached out to me about my blogs before — whether emails, comments, in-person or otherwise — and I am always grateful to each and every one of you <3 

6) Fame, income, career… a book deal… eternal legacy blah blah blah 

Alright, we all can dream. But this is a possibility, no matter how slim! 

2) Why you might not want to blog

1) Too much effort 

Sure. Writing takes time; if you’re going to write something that the public might see, it’s probably worth a look-over and proof-reading before you put it out. That takes time and effort, and when you have school/work/other life stuff, it makes sense to deprioritize blogs. But I do think it’s worth it to do hard things, and things expand to fill the time you give it. I’ve been doing some private daily writing with a few friends, and it’s been great for helping me write without burning myself out again. 

2) Loss of privacy 

This is a fair concern. Scrapers can take your content and let people use this against you; you should probably also not share all of your thoughts online for both professional reasons and otherwise. I also worried a lot about scrapers taking my content; at some point, I think I just realized that I was probably losing way more data than a few blogs, so on net the benefits are probably more worth it. 

3) AI slop 

This was a surprisingly big reason that contributed to my inactivity. I felt a little tired of all the AI slop that I was reading everywhere. What do you mean I can’t use my elegant em-dash without being taken for ChatGPT anymore? Is there any point in writing work you want to be seen if it’s just going to be drowned out by people literally churning AI slop out by the day? It’s pretty upsetting. Until I thought about some pieces I used to like a lot, and then realised that they were also slop in a different way. There’s already plenty of bad writing out there; you can’t escape it. Also, this is hopefully liberating in the sense that you can sleep soundly knowing that even if your writing is shit, there’s probably worse shit out there that people are somehow reading and praising anyway. 

4) Over-narrativization 

I talked to Kayode D. ‘27 about this a lot; a pit people who write too much can fall into is “too much writing, not enough living.” Spending too much time in your head does things to you. Sometimes you should focus on living life in the present rather than trying to document everything, and sometimes you should not live life just to fulfill a specific narrative. Andrew, a good friend of mine and one of the best writers I (personally) know, has some good notes about this. 

3) How do you blog?

If you think maybe the benefits are worth the potential costs, here are a couple of ways to get started with blogging. 

If you don’t know what to write about, there’s a lot of blog prompts out there. Streams of consciousness are okay; just feel free to record whatever you were thinking about. If there’s any concepts that you want to understand better, you can also spend time writing about that. 

If you feel insecure about your ideas, you can also just treat blogging as a way for friends to keep in touch with you. Back when I kept a private blog, my friends would respond and comment and it was a really lovely way to keep in touch. Once you get over the activation energy of your first blog, the other blogs may be easier than you think. 

4) Where do you blog?

- Old people use wordpress and wix (but only if you’re really feeling cursed). 

- Substack is the hip new platform that everyone seems to be on, and it’s easy to make a domain and get started. I hosted a private blog on substack in the past; they make it pretty easy to control most things about your blog

- If you’re feeling more independent and high-tech, you can also host your own mailing list / website for your blog. There are a lot of website templates out there that you can pull from github; I’ve had no personal experience with this, but there’s a lot of information out there anyway. 

- And finally, we should maybe acknowledge the elephant in the room…

5) 🫵 YOU could write for MIT admissions! 🫵

Blogging for MIT admissions has been one of the best things I’ve done in college. The benefits are numerous: 

- You get to hang out in the admissions office. It is a beautiful space with large windows that let in a lot of sun, and a beaver plushie that I have fallen asleep on at least three times. Did I mention the snack palace? 

- You get to hang out in the admissions office with the bloggers. Every two weeks, you get paid to yap with these very very cool people and just catch up with each other’s lives. I think the admission bloggers have this really wonderful diverse set of backgrounds and experiences, and it’s always super interesting to hang out with fellow bloggers! I could say a lot about every single blogger and their quirks. It’s like we’re almost friends, which is pretty cool. 
no comments about the parasocial relationships that I have from sniping everyone though…


- no comments about the parasocial relationships that I have from sniping everyone though…

- You get to hang out in the admissions office with the bloggers, and the people who work here, I guess. 
         They’re kinda cool and I’m not even being paid to say this. 
      
 They need to stop being so interesting, kind, and fun to hang out with so that I stop getting 
         derailed for like an hour 
      
 every time I pull up to the admissions office. 

- 
         The platform is based. 
      
 I don’t know about you but I spent a year obsessively reading the Admission Blogs because I thought the bloggers were super cool and it was fun to get a window into their life, even if I wasn’t going to get into MIT let alone the blogs. Little did I know…

- The above point also means that you occasionally get cool fanmail and really sweet comments! It’s super lovely and I’m so honoured that people actually Perceive Me when this happens. 

- Also free art of a likeness of yourself is pretty cool.

With that said, you should not apply to blog with admissions if…

- You don’t go to MIT. Sorry, in that case you’re just not eligible. 

Otherwise, why not? Use the application as an excuse to write some stuff down and recognise how rich and interesting your life is. 

- And here, I really want to be clear that “thinking you’re not good enough” is NOT a good reason for not applying. Your life is worth thinking about, and regardless of whether you get in as a blogger, you will be able to take away writings & reflections that you wouldn’t have done! 

Anyway, I had a lot of fun writing this. I might start writing again when I have time, but in the meantime this blog has persuaded me that I should start genuinely writing again. I think I’m literally just pent up with not journalling OR blogging OR essaying for the past couple months, because I’ve been busy writing briefs and long ass slack messages or whatever. 

If you’ve made it to the end of this, congrats! Thanks for reading — I am always grateful for the infinite series of coincidences that lead my words to other people. I hope to come across yours one day :) 

And perhaps, just perhaps… I’ll see you in 
         The Office 
      
 one day! 

Additional notes: 

I wrote this, and then while proofreading, realised that in fact Vincent H. ‘23 wrote about like exactly this on his blog a couple weeks ago. And that I had read it. Whatever ideas overlap here is possibly a convergence but more likely reframed from his piece; you should read his piece too! https://mindslice.substack.com/p/what-is-the-point-of-blogging

There’s a lot of blogging advice out there. This is an opinion piece, so please feel free to get other opinions on blogging (although you will be biased towards people who decided to write in the first place, so try and just talk to your friends too).","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-17-at-11.54.24%E2%80%AFPM-1.png

Day in the Life of a MIT Mechanical Engineering UROP Student,Kayode D. '27,5,2025-07-14T00:00:00-04:00,"One of the coolest things at MIT is how easily undergrads can join research through UROPs (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program). I did my first one this past semester and finished it over the summer, working in Professor David Wallace’s lab. Alongside a grad student named Chuck, I helped design underwater robots for students at a university in Portugal. Here’s a quick look at some highlights from the project—and what a 
        random day
      
 might’ve looked like!

The Final ROV design I was building towards this summer 🤩

 The biggest challenge in this was that they did not have the labs and equipment we have, so if it breaks it needs to be repairable with Home Depot parts. 

 

9:38 – Wake up really late because my alarm didn’t go off. 

This summer, I’m staying at ET, an off-campus fraternity. What’s really interesting is that while everyone has a room to put their stuff in, almost no one sleeps in them. Instead, everyone sleeps on the third floor of the house, in a giant room with bunk beds like at a summer camp. It is kept dark and quiet 24/7 to not disturb anyone’s sleeping, and we use vibrating alarm clocks to wake up. I unfortunately set mine incorrectly and did not wake up on time. Whoops.

10:00 – I BlueBike over to MIT Campus

As MIT students, we get a discount on the Boston bike share system, called BlueBikes. For $50 a year, you get unlimited rides on the bikes around Boston and Cambridge. This is an absolute STEAL for when the T doesn’t go where you need and you don’t have a car. [Having a car on campus is pretty impractical unless you’ve got a frat parking spot. Otherwise, parking is expensive and unnecessary most things you need are within walking/biking/train distance.]

 

10:30 – Meet up with my advisor, Chuck. 

 



Where I met and worked with the lab. fully stocked [or at least connected within campus] to everything I could need for the project, including emergency muppets.



When I met with Chuck, we talked about an ongoing issue with the ROV—that’s a Remotely Operated Vehicle, basically an underwater robot controlled by a person at the surface. Most of my work for this UROP has focused on designing and building these ROVs.

Here’s the problems we were having: 

When the ROV propels forward, a torque is put on the system causing it to flip over and drift upwards. My first idea didn’t work the way I expected it to, and we still wanted to do something to counteract the torque. So what did I do? 

 

11:00 – I HIT THE BOOKS!!!

I went to Barker Library to research ROVs and how designers counteract this problem. Most ROVs have the motors places in line with the COM, so they don’t really have this problem. 

Thinking back, I remembered a lecture from last semester’s 2.007 class, Design and Manufacturing. Professor Amos Winter talked about how he designed a new fan blade for XYZ company when he was younger. He had no clue how fan blades worked, but he knew he could research airplane wings, and that led him to his design that increased air flow by a good amount!

I had tried this approach, researching how tail wings on an airplane and rudders on big ships work:

 

So I researched how they worked and made a design for new “wings” to add to the robot. 

From this and measurements of the ROV, I was able to make a design for the rudders [which I drew onto the sheet metal and is now on the robots halfway across the world. Sorry I didn’t take a picture…].

 

12:30 – Lunch at Chipotle

Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of food on campus during the summer. You have to walk a little ways out to the Chipotle by Kendall Square, or 
        Roxy’s Grilled Cheese
      
 up Mass Ave. 

I ran into my friend, Isa J. ‘27, at Chipotle. I don’t remember what we talked about, it was a month ago. I think we talked about having a 
        bonfire
      
with whoever was still on campus at some point. 
        It never happened.
      


 

1:15 PM – Go to Pappalardo to make part

Pappalardo is one of the biggest Mechanical Engineering makerspaces on campus, and it’s where 2.007 is held in the spring semesters. I’ve tried making sheet metal parts at other places on campus, but none come close to the speed at which I can iterate and create at Pappalardo. This is thanks to the three horsemen of my fabocalypse: The Shear, Break, and Punch.

Most makerspaces have bandsaws and drill presses for woodworking, but few are set up to cut sheet metal at the thickness I needed. But with these tools, you don’t even need electricity! It’s powered by sheer will…and the shear will, too!

 

2:00 PM – Time to test!

I met back up with Chuck at the Alumni Swimming pool to test out the ROV. 

 

The rudders work great! Yippee! 

 

4:00 – I clean up and go home!!

While I’m rinsing off the ROV, an older gentleman mentions to me that he used to do testing in the Alumni pool when he was an undergrad. I asked what he was testing. 

His name is Dave Schloerb. His senior thesis was designing a speaker to be used underwater by divers to communicate. He told me that it didn’t work perfectly and that the thesis likely does not exist online, so I probably couldn’t read it. It was a really interesting conversation, though. 

Later on, I looked him up online to see if I could find his work. 

 

Excuse me??? Dave Schloerb is the GOAT????

In 1974, Dave submitted an article to Skin Diver Magazine which you can read here. When he was in high school, he wanted to spend 24 hours at the bottom of the lake near his house. So with the help of a buddy, he constructed a two room base out of oil drums and scrap metal. Using a pump and hose to pipe water down to the base [dubbed “Julius”], he started his time spent in the murky depths. Read on to see how things turned out for our hero!

He went on to do projects for a diving company after college and came back to get a masters, continuing his pursuits with underwater engineering. Literally so cool.

… 

MIT is so cool. Like obviously it’s a cool place, but what CJ Q. ‘23 said is also true. The best part of MIT is the people. People here get curious about something and actually go build it, test it, break it, and try again. I don’t think I fully understood that in high school, but I’m glad I can be here now. And you don’t have to be creating underwater bunkers in high school to belong at a place like MIT, heck I was making board games out of cardboard in high school. But those sort of passions can be applied and reapplied to future ideas and pursuits, and it makes these super cool things. Whether it’s building a robot, designing an egg incubator out of a trash can, or figuring out how to wake up with a vibrating alarm, there’s room for all of it.

Maybe I’ll try to get coffee with Dave this fall. 

…

We also tested the robot in the Charles river later that week:

Tour of an MIT student’s notebook,Anika H. '26,5,2025-07-08T00:00:00-04:00,"Note: This is not a guide to keeping a notebook because everyone has their own style of taking notes and keeping organized. But if you’re looking to start keeping a little notebook or everything and have no idea where to start, feel free to use this as inspiration.

my scrungly boy

Historically, I’ve only ever finished three notebooks out of the dozens I’ve had over the years, including the most recent one. The first was a composition notebook filled with spelling practices from elementary school. The second was a multipurpose notebook that I handcrafted and bound in 8th grade, filled with sketches, diary entries, and brainstorming. My most recently completed one, which I finished a month ago is also multipurpose, though far more technical with more diverse content.

It has everything has notes from all my classes, doodles from any TTRPGs I happen to be playing, notes from my summer internships, sketches, technical drawings, and scrapbooking.

Obviously, it’s impractical to take a picture of each and every the 100+ pages I’ve scrawled across, so what you’re getting will just be the highlights. The brown colored pages are from the completed notebook, and the white dotted pages are from the current one I’m using right now.

 

Diagrams and Technical drawings

If I had to pick, this is my favorite part of my notebook. I use CAD (Solidworks, Fusion360, OnShape) for different projects, but because drawing is way faster for me, I like to sketch it out first to get the rough shape and dimensions down and also have a preliminary design to get feedback on.

Class Notes

My notes vary from day to day depending on everything from my interest in the subject, the pace of the lecture, how much sleep I’ve gotten the previous night, and how nice the ink pen I’m using feels on the page. Especially for technical classes, I like to include diagrams to help with understanding. They’re not the best notes to give a friend when they miss class and want to catch up on what happened, but they’re good enough to be helpful for psets and test review.

I will also keep note of things that confuse me by writing little footnotes and such around that actual content. I find it a little funny in hindsight how crass some of them turned out to be (usually a good indicator of frustration)

Scratch paper

These are the messiest parts of my notebook. The main way I was able to finish my notebook was by accepting that it was not going to be neat and ✨aesthetic✨ the entire way through. I generally believe that “form follows function”, and as such should prioritize using the notebook for what it’s intended for before worrying about how nice it looks.

Scribbling stuff down is a part of how I process, and really useful to me for both calculations and brainstorming.

Planning and Brainstorming

This is usually just a short bullet point list of stuff I need to do. Some specific projects have more elaborate details.

 

Art and other drawings

I really like playing tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons and Dragons and Mothership, and throughout each session I’ll draw a few pictures of the world we’re in, our characters, and the monsters we encounter.

Sometimes I go outdoors to sketch landscapes and passing strangers. I’ll live sketch once in a while if I have free time or don’t feel like doing real work. Sometimes, Alexi will organize sketch nights in Random Hall, where we hunt down a willing victim to model and pose for an hour while we draw them. Our sketch lengths increase in time from 30 seconds to 1 minutes, to 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Margin sketches are just evidence of me getting distracted or really liking the pen I’m using.

Scrapbooking

When I was almost finished with my notebook, I decided it wouldn’t be complete without a few pictures, so I printed, sorted, and glued them in. Most are vaguely categorized by topic. I have several pages with Tetazoo, some of cats, some of family, some of classes, and one page filled with just mugshots I got of my friends.

Other notes

Here are some bonus pages that I didn’t really know how to categorize:

I do these things and think they are helpful but I would stop just short of calling it advice

Page numbers: I like numbering my pages, because it lets me refer back to pages for notes I took on the same subject or a diagram that would supplement it. My new notebook has a table of contents, which is really really nice, but I was too lazy to make one for my old notebook.

Contact information: If you plan on keeping a notebook or sketchbook of any kind, you should write down your name and contact information on the first page in case it gets lost. I know from experience that losing a sketchbook you’ve worked hard on is one of the most devastating things that can happen to an artist. It’s not that much different for notebooks, especially if it has all your class notes.

My preferred writing implement: I don’t use pencil for my notes when I can help it. I like the finality of using an ink pen and enjoy leaving a record of my mistakes, not to mention it shows up better on the page and doesn’t fade.

My pen of choice is the 0.1mm Pigma Micron pen. It uses archival ink, so the ink doesn’t bleed when it gets wet or fade over time. It flows wonderfully, and the only problem I’ve encountered is that the tip is fairly fragile. When I drop the pen on it’s tip, it either splits into two or leans on its side, making thicker, more inconsistent lines. For finer details, I use the 0.05mm one, though the lines are too thin for notetaking and the tip will shrink back into the metal support if I push too hard on the page over a period of time. When available, I use white gel pens for highlights on my drawings.

Ballpoint pens are ew. Still prefer them to pencil though.

Holding the book together: My old notebook has a button clasp and my new one has a rubber band attached to the back to hold it shut. Many of my pages have come loose, so it’s nice to have a way of keeping everything together. When it’s bouncing around in your backpack with laptops, books, and all the rest of your stuff, keeping it shut will prevent pages from folding and tearing out.

 

If by your last page you have formed an emotional attachment to your notebook, you’ll know that you’ve kept it well.

good luck to all my notebook and sketchbook fiends out there","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notebook-400x533.jpg

Life Tokens,Allison E. '27,1,2025-07-06T00:00:00-04:00,"When I was younger, one of my favorite board games to play with my family was “The Game of Life.” It’s a bit like the mobile game BitLife, I suppose. You start as a young adult, and walk along the pathways of life–choosing a career, getting married, having kids, getting promoted (or fired), buying a house, and eventually retiring. The goal is to collect as much money as possible over the course of your life. There’s a bunch of different squares that you might land on–some are “payday” squares, some are “lawsuit” squares, and some just involve random actions like paying taxes or donating to a charity. Sometimes, though, you land on a “LIFE” square. Each of these squares represents an interesting life experience–maybe you visit the Grand Canyon, maybe you host a family reunion, maybe you break a world record. 

More importantly, though, when you land on these squares, you also get to pick up a 
        life token
      
, which you cash out at the end of the game in exchange for money–$10,000, $20,000, even $50,000, equivalent to the payday salary of a “computer designer” in-game.

The reason that The Game of Life has to quantify life experiences as money is just game mechanics–
        the game rules determine the winner by amount of money.
      
 But I think it’s a value system that has truth even outside the rules of the game.

Right now, while we’re young, there’s plenty of short term gain from interesting life experiences–joy, new knowledge, friendship, etc. Sixty years from now, though, the ability to look back on all the interesting life experiences we’ve had will be all the more valuable to us when we’re all retired, our friends and family have dispersed, and our bodies are too worn out to do much. If/when I turn 80, how much money would I give up to have the memories and experience of cooking a sixteen-dish Thanksgiving with ten college friends? Honestly, probably at least $2,000. How much to have dragged 24 pumpkins through the streets of Boston? Maybe $300. How much to have investigated possible arson in Burton-Conner after a 4:00 am fire alarm? Probably at least $500. 

I’ve spent the past year or so living by this philosophy. Shenanigans are worth it not only for the joy in the moment, but also for the value of their memories later in life. It’s led me to incredible tomfoolery–building a snow fort at 3:00 am, howling at the moon in Central Park, chasing the aurora at Tufts on a random Thursday. Each of these memories is worth more to me than most of the objects I own, but we don’t have a good system to value experiences the way we do objects. So I think about them as life tokens, and I collect as many as I can.

P.S. I once convinced a friend, Ojas G. ‘27, to snort a line of 
        li-hing powder
      
 using the life token argument. At first, we were going to pay him $5 to do it, but I managed to convince him that it would be worth at least $100 in life tokens when he was retired and reliving the good old days, and he agreed to do it. I stand by the truth of that claim. He might not 😆","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/91XSa1fIoTL._AC_SL1500_-800x540.jpg

Be a Blogger 2025!,Ceri R. '16,9,2025-07-01T00:00:00-04:00,"It’s July again, which means that:

- I started a co-op Stardew Valley save file with my partner and am trying to squeeze in some night gardening when I can to stay cool during extreme heat waves

- I’m fleeing to the mountains for a much-needed vacation, where I will sit in backyards & photosynthesize & float on a river & not think about emails for a couple weeks

- it’s time for anyone who wants to blog to let us gently poke through your writing, as if we were a beekeeper examining a hive in an unusual location

MIT students are the Institute’s best ambassadors and community-builders. Admissions Officers (AOs) can explain complicated processes and provide words of wisdom, but we can’t write about what it’s like to experience Interphase EDGE/x, or live on Conner 2, or host an adMIT for Sin LíMITe, or UROP, or become a mentor for Project Manus, or learn a cool new thing in class, and so forth. The mission of the blogs is to help our students communicate what MIT is actually like. We do this by hiring students who have good judgment, a compelling voice and perspective, and the disciplined exuberance to post at least twice a month on average. We may ask you to help advise creative projects in the office and serve as a touchstone for student culture. We pay you for this work. It’s a pretty good gig, to be honest. This application was designed mostly by student bloggers to help ask and answer the kinds of questions that might be useful for identifying their kin. Your submissions will be read by a small committee made up of AOs, senior bloggers, and a few blogger cruft. Please note that *only* current MIT students may apply to be bloggers (i.e. no prospective students or students at other colleges). This application is open to all MIT undergraduates of any class year. This application will go live on 07/01/2025 and close on 08/01/2025. Anyone who has started their application by 08/01/2025 will have a grace period of 7 days to complete and submit it. We will begin reviewing complete applications in August, and we hope to select and alert bloggers before orientation if possible.

To ASE Or Not To ASE,Aiden H. '28,3,2025-06-26T00:00:00-04:00,"It’s June! Which means of course you’re not interested in the graduating seniors, or Hank Green’s commencement address, or all the cool things people are doing over the summer–you’re interested in me, because I just finished my freshman year, and what a scary and tumultuous time it was! Nonetheless, it is done.

Looking back to last summer, everything I questioned about coming into MIT is absolutely not all what I should have been concerned about. Tragically, I see my peers falling into the same trap. On 
        r/mit,
      
 all of the prefrosh seem to be freaking out over imposter syndrome/is MIT too hard/am I smart enough to be here. And while I do see validity in these questions, what I think is more important is how they answered–instead of answering yes/no, I think simply understanding the class system and the choices you have freshman year will clarify what academic situations you can find yourself in (not just “am I smart enough to be in it”).

Allow me to half-explain/half-give advice on academic preparation for your freshman year.

PNR

This is the simplest and most commonly known, so we’ll start here!

Freshman fall, all classes are taken on PNR, or Pass/No Record. This means that if you get a passing grade (70-100) it will show up on your transcript as simply a P for pass. No it doesn’t matter if you got a 71 or a 99, it will be exactly the same. If you receive a failing grade, it simply won’t show up at all (there will be “no record”). These classes do not contribute to your GPA.

Freshman spring you will start earning letter grades for passing that do affect GPA, but you still will have NR if you fail a class. Failing grades only “count” starting sophomore year.

This should take a lot of the burden off of your shoulders, because you simply won’t need to meet the same standards freshman fall that you did in high school. Yes, MIT is harder than high school, but getting a 60 on a test won’t be the end of the world in the same way. Also, if you’re curious about your academic abilities in these upper-level classes, you literally have a trial period to assess yourself so you know where you should place yourself in classes moving forward.

ASEs are exams taken before every registration season that allow students to test out and receive credit for a class by taking the final for that subject. Scores for ASEs do show up on transcripts but do not affect GPA. ASEs can be taken during any year at MIT, but are most common entering freshman fall because ASEs also fall under PNR.

Some ASEs are known to be more difficult than others. 
        5.111
      
 is known to have a much lower pass rate than tests like 
        6.100A.
      
 This shouldn’t entirely scare you, though, because most of this is external factors (the average MIT student knows more code than college chemistry). The biggest thing to be aware of is how different the ASE is from high school/prior content. 5.111 notably covers content that is not included in AP or IB chemistry, while 18.01 is pretty similar to AP Calc BC. Depending on the test you want to take, you might need to learn new content on your own. No matter what, you should study before.

Now the bigger question: should you even take an ASE, and if so, how many?

In my opinion (which is not fact and not the only one you should refer to), this is how you should approach taking an ASE:

I have extreme interest in this topic and have already taken a similar college-level class — Go for it! You have nothing to lose on PNR, you like the subject, and it wouldn’t be a time suck because you already know a decent amount.

I have taken an AP/IB equivalent and think the class would mostly be review — Take it if you want, but study before and review the test content to see if you’ve actually covered it all before.

I hate this subject and don’t want to spend a semester learning it — This is fair and a common reason for taking an ASE. Go for it if you have a lot of spare time, but remember that you’re still learning the content either way. Is it worth your summer studying something you don’t like instead of taking it with friends later on?

I haven’t taken this class but I think I should so I look smart and can get as far ahead as possible and get started on senior-level classes ASAP — Don’t.

While ASEs seem like a great thing (they can be!), there is something to be said about taking these classes with your peers. Being too studious can bar you from everything else that makes college and MIT special. There was always something fun about walking out of my dorm at 7:00 PM to go to a physics exam and seeing 700 other students trek across campus at the same time, all knowing we were about to go through the exact same pain at the same time, and then hearing everyone on the way back gossip about the answers and that one proctor who was really annoying for no reason etc. etc.

My biggest piece of advice: don’t try and go crazy on the ASEs just cause. There are so many people who have to take every single GIR, and are still just as successful and smart as everyone else here. Yes, you will graduate on time–the majors are designed to be that way.

For me, I’m going to MIT so I can go into biotech, not physics research–there’s no reason I should be a physics genius before having taken the classes (or the bio/chem classes, too, considering I’m here to learn and therefore should not expect myself to know everything that I’m going to be taught in my major).

There is very very little shame here that I’ve experienced. Everyone has a collective understanding that we’re cracked nerds, so we don’t walk around flexing about AP/SAT scores or what we self-studied. In fact, I feel like I talk about academic validation so much less than I did in high school because I know everyone here is smart and just trying their best. No one will praise you if you take an ASE. No one will shame you if you take a slower-paced class. You’ll be fine nonetheless.

Math/Physics Prep

By far most people freak out that they don’t fit the “math genius” standards of MIT students in popular culture. I’m here to tell you that you don’t need to know the graph theory from Good Will Hunting or win the MIT Integration Bee to be adept enough for MIT math.

As a part of the GIRs, everyone must take 
        18.01,
      
 
        18.02,
      
 
        8.01
      
, and 
        8.02.
      
 Unlike potential expectations/assumptions, most students will take these classes. It is rare to meet someone who knows all the material of the classes already for two reasons: 1) Most people don’t have access to/don’t spend the time studying ahead in these subjects in high school, and 2) The MIT version of these subjects (8.01 and 8.02 specifically) are notably harder and involve more complex foundational math. The most common class to have tested/placed out of is 18.01 through an ASE or a 5 on AP Calc BC (a 2009 newsletter said about 1/2 of the freshman class does–however, I don’t know if this is still true). From there, a handful test out of 18.02 or 8.01, and even fewer test out of 8.02. If this is you, that’s beautiful! I, and many many other students didn’t

To make things even more confusing, these classes come in ~flavors~. Each class has a regular and an “advanced” version (e.g. 8.01 and 8.012). The “advanced” version is typically much more mathematically rigorous with a focus on proofs, but covers the same content and counts for the same credit. (Before you ask, no, taking the advanced version does not make you cooler, it just means you might have a harder time or you really really love the math behind Newtonian Mechanics). The vast majority of students will opt for the “regular” version.

18.01 and 8.01 also include slower-paced versions (18.01L and 8.01L) for students with no prior experience or students who find the grueling pace of your first semester to be easily fixable with these versions. These classes continue into 
        IAP
      
 and have that extra month to spread out content over. People on the outside of MIT assume we judge when people do/want to learn at a slower pace, which is absolutely not true. Every single time I’ve heard 8.01L come up in conversation, it has never been “oh my god are you stupid why aren’t you good at physics” and has always been “I should’ve taken 8.01L, too”.

So where should you start? You’ll talk with your advisor when you register for classes, and I should of course not be the only person you take advice on this from, but if you ask me:

Physics

If you like physics and got a 5 on both AP Physics C exams: Take 8.02 or 8.022

If you don’t like physics/forgot it all and don’t know how in the world you got two fives: Take 8.01 or 8.012

If you take AP Physics 1 or 2, or didn’t get two fives: Take 8.01

If you’ve never taken any physics: Take 8.01L or 8.01

Calculus

If you like math and got a 5 on AP Calculus BC: Take 18.02

If you don’t like math/forgot it all/don’t know how you got a 5: Take 18.01A/18.02A (good if you don’t want to completely restart but also don’t want to jump straight into multi)

If you only took AP Calc AB, didn’t get a 5 in BC, or would just feel better learning it again: 18.01

If you’ve never taken calculus: Take 18.01 or 18.01L

 

tl;dr you’ll be great!",,0
alone in cologne,Veronica P. '27,2,2025-06-26T00:00:00-04:00,"I counted today, and since freshman year orientation I have said goodbye to my parents ten times.

The first time they dropped me off at MIT, my mom couldn’t contain her tears. Holding my hand, she was the only one of us truly overcome with sadness. She’d squeeze tighter and tighter, as if enough pressure would coax the misery out, but, for all she tried, the moment refused to hit me. Almost accusingly, I remember, she pivoted towards my dad, “How can you not be upset? Are you not going to miss her?”

 

“Of course I’m going to miss her, but why would I be sad? I’m too excited for her.” 

 

My dad had moved even further for college. After qualifying for a scholarship program, he traveled from Venezuela to Germany without knowing a single German sentence. As a student, he could only afford to call his family once a month— a drastic change for a sixteen year old. (He spent my entire childhood swearing it was fifteen, but after his fortieth retelling or so my sister and I gathered enough skepticism to do the math)

If I had to guess, there are a number of reasons he revisits the experience so often. Anytime I felt too scared, too young, too out of my comfort zone, he would use his story to convince me that I was capable of more than I believed. He always seemed to look back on his German years as one of the best periods of his life. From a young age, my sister and I were raised with his itch to travel, with that sense of independence and exploration. For my dad, watching me leave Texas was like watching everything he had ever wanted for me come true.

 

And every goodbye since, for both of my parents, has mirrored the emotions of that very first time. This tenth one, however, was particularly sentimental; inspired by my dad, I’ve set off to intern in Germany for the summer!

 

Back home, my little sister is preparing to go to college herself. Not to be outdone, she’s moving out of state as well. She’s one of the bravest people I know, but even so, it’s hard not to see the fear in her. She’s closer to my parents than I was at her age; since visiting me in February, she’s struggled to stomach the idea of leaving home. Recently, I tried to tap back into how I felt when I was in her shoes. For some reason, I couldn’t remember being nearly as scared.

Perhaps that’s because, for the most part, I’ve always held the same mindset as my dad. I remember not feeling as homesick as many of my friends freshman year, I was too caught up in the novelty that was right in front of me. If anything, I wasted no time in applying to MISTI, in finding ways to spend my breaks even further away from Texas. When I reflect on my adventures, I’m quick to recall that sense of accomplishment, the thrill of having ventured out into the unknown.

But that thrill has to be earned somehow. It has to be earned through fear. If I dig a little deeper, into the less savory parts of my memory, I can recall those nights of crying to my mom on the couch, of slipping into accidental tears over FaceTime.

And while this is my tenth goodbye, my third MISTI adventure, this time around the fear feels more acute. I’ve called my parents more in the past week than I usually do over an entire month. I thought I was immune to homesickness, and here I am, feeling it two years too late. My previous MISTI’s have been no longer than three weeks, in countries where I had a better grasp of the language and culture. Here, I feel uncharacteristically hesitant to venture out on my own: certain I’ll miss some social cue, certain I’ll come into harm’s way.

 

Despite this, my dad’s encouragement has its permanent place in the back of my mind. I trust that if I lean into the fear, I’ll ultimately be glad I did. I remember as a kid, he’d drag me onto rollercoaster after rollercoaster. During the line, I’d watch the ride and knot my stomach around every single loop; I’d beg him to let us turn around, try to convince him that this next ride was truly too much for me. But without fail, by the time we lifted our seatbelts, I was always exclaiming “that was AWESOME!” and racing to ride again.

So, last Sunday, I set off without my roommate to take a day trip to Cologne. At lunch, I sat behind another American girl, also a table for one. When the waiter arrived with our plates, I found that we had ordered the same exact dish. My phone buzzed with messages from my parents. Maybe I wasn’t so alone, after all.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3666-400x225.jpeg,1
the fear and delight of fire spinning,Anika H. '26,9,2025-06-21T00:00:00-04:00,"quick note: i did a TED talk with kano about fire spinning once, but we were asked to do it four days before the event, so we had three days to prepare, and i shrivel from embarrassment every time someone mentions or finds it. so, i’m writing a very high effort blog about fire spinning to redeem myself and wipe that talk from my memory.

when afterthoughts burn and the day comes to close, a fire in my hands, a warmth in my soul.

Once upon a time…

I joined MIT Spinning Arts when I was a freshman, and since then I have spun countless props on fire, danced and performed with it, gotten accidental fire haircuts, and lit myself on fire (on accident and on purpose). Besides committing to MIT, joining Spinning Arts was the boldest decision I made in my life, but also one of the best. I’ll spare you the whole “the real fire was the friends I made along the way!” speech, because I’d spend forever and a half gushing about how cool and supportive and hilarious everyone I met there was. By joining this community, I went from tiptoeing around a lighter to loving fire with a passion just short of a pyromaniac’s.

Is it real fire?

Yep. We don’t have a magic coating that makes us fireproof, which means it’s hot and will burn you if you screw up. The fire isn’t any less real than the one you sit around toasting marshmallows in on a camping trip.

Isn’t it dangerous?

Of course it is, but so is football, and archery, dance, and sailing, all for slightly different reasons. Fire spinning is just another sport with it’s own set of precautions people need to take to stay safe. The only reason we can look dangerously hot (pun totally intended) is because we have proper procedures and trainings. Every firespinner has at least one “safety” with a fire blanket. We have a separate fuel dump area from the spinning field and a double bucket system in case things do catch fire. And for every prop we spin and every move we try, we spend hours practicing it off fire before we try it on fire for the first time.



We have this and many more measures in place to keep ourselves alive and uninjured WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TRY THIS WITHOUT PROPER TRAINING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. While I’d love this blog to be the reason someone new joins the club, I’d rather not be the reason a lovely stranger on the internet ends up turning into a human-shaped flaming hot Cheeto.



How does fire spinning work?

Fire spinners use props that they light on fire and manipulate. It consists of at least one wick, and a handling end. The handling end is for the spinner to control the fire, and can be any length of rope for a dynamic prop, or a rigid structure for static props. The wick itself does not burn and instead soaks up the fuel, which is then lit on fire. the burn time of the prop varies depending on the size and shape of the wick, as well as the speed you’re spinning it at.

Here’s a rough list of common props! This is not an extensive list though, there are way more.



Some people choose to make their own props, and you can get pretty creative considering the grip and wick can be basically any shape and attached any way you want. Aside from the fire frying pan, people have made hook swords, a fire bird puppet, puppy darts (which slide from a puppy hammer into a meteor dart, and even laser cut their own intricate fan designs out of aluminum. As far as number of different props goes, the list includes this and whatever else you crazy engineers come up with.

Practice practice practice

Many club members choose a one or two props they specialize in and hone their skills, getting into really really advanced tricks. As such, we end up with some absolutely cracked staff and poi spinners. I chose the route where I try a lot of different props and get okay at them before getting excited about another challenge and trying something new. I would consider myself practiced at about four props, though I have tried everything i could get my hands on. There’s also the crazy talented people who spin a lot of props and are good at all of them, but it all depends on how much time you spend practicing.

There are other fire arts including fleshing (contact fire), fire eating, and fire breathing, that club exec has formally reintroduced after a lot of planning and effort (including both training and paperwork). I mainly do firebreathing, practice fleshing occasionally, and don’t really eat fire. This would make the post too long, so I’ll maybe talk about these some other time.

Why I like fire

After all that talk of fear danger, I still chose to stay, because it’s really really fun. It’s not something I can fully describe in words, but I will try anyway.

When I’m spinning fire, I forget about everything else. Basically, when I’m spinning, I’m in “the zone”. It’s a level of calm and focus I usually don’t get in the hectic day-to-day of an MIT student.

Fireshows are always some of the best highlights of my year. I get to show off how much I’ve improved, and I get to watch my friends perform insane tricks and choreography. We love the audience and the audience loves us too. When I’m not performing or safetying, I’m cheering my lungs off in the crowd. So if my throat doesn’t hurt the next day, I didn’t cheer loud enough. At the end of the show, I go find my friends to go throttle them and tell them how freaking awesome they are, and we’re all talking and congratulating and giving each other rib-cracking hugs, and I absolutely love these moments.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/fire-1-400x439.jpg

Pictures From a Year of Classes,Richard O. '28,4,2025-06-20T00:00:00-04:00,"So, about a month ago, I submitted my last exam for the year in Johnson Athletic Center which marked the end of a very, very, very long first year at MIT. So, like the first and second two times, I’m going to finish off the year by giving you all a full run down of everything that happened during this last semester…but with pictures (because I like pictures).

Part 14: January Shenanigans

So as you may know by now, MIT has this silly one month period during January called the Independent Activities Period (better known as IAP – learn more about it here, here, and here) where you pretty much get to do whatever you want with your life for the whole month of January. So for me, I spent this month learning some new skills while finishing up the second half of 18.02A.

But before leaving for Boston, I decided to go on a hiking trip with some of my friends to a place called Old Rag back in VA.

 

 

 

 

So yea I somehow learned how to snowboard that day and left with a pretty bruised tailbone:

Story time: So in order to get back to the train station we needed to take this bus right. And the bus had only 2 times it cycled between the mountain and the station in the afternoon: 4PM and 6PM. So we had planned on leaving at 4PM to play it safe. So before we left I wanted to get a vid of me snowboarding down so I did like my last run at 3:30PM. Got to the bottom of the mountain and realized I never pressed record… So here I am thinking: “dang – I didn’t get a single vid of my first time snowboarding”. Turns out, by the time we got to the bus station we missed the bus by like 30secs cause it really left at like 3:55PM. Pretty much a blessing and a curse cause now I had two hours to get a new video before we absolutely had to make the last bus. (We actually also missed the second bus and had to get driven by one of the mountain staff to the train station with like 10 seconds to spare before the last train left for the night…but that’s a story for another time).

Part 18: That Weird Period between Spring Break and Finals

Weather got warmer. Campus got livelier. World became more colorful. And finals were looming around the corner.





Part 19: The Second Great Finals War

So eventually…it was that time again. Finals season was back. I beat the institute during first semester, but this semester the stakes were higher. We had a total of 3 battles: 8.02 (Electricity and Magnetism), 6.1010 (Fundamentals of Programming), and 6.1200 (Discrete Math for Comp Sci). Would’ve been four but CMS.100 (Intro to Media Studies) had a final paper and presentation instead of a test so we’re only counting three.

Last day of school was on a Tuesday. So, the Grand Lock-In began with reviewing all of 8.02 from the beginning on 9 large chalkboards in the Green Building Lecture Hall from 18.02A.

 

So, at some point, Tuesday turned into Friday and the battles had begun.

- Friday. 8.02. 9AM. Johnson Athletic Center. Just me, a pencil I had to borrow from a friend because I forgot you need those to actually take an exam, and the life-altering memory of the reviews I watched from Mohamed 

- 3 hours later. Noon. Test Complete. Boom. Knocked out. Beat that battle and had two more to go. Richie: 1, Institvte: 0

Next was 6.1010 on Monday and then 6.1200 on Tuesday so I had the weekend to study both but 6.1200 had ALL my attention because I knew that battle was gonna be rough…

- Monday. 6.1010. 1:30PM. Johnson Athletic Center. Just me, another pencil I had to borrow from a friend because I forgot you need those to actually take an exam again, and my belief in the power of environment diagrams

- 3 hours later. 4:30PM. Test Complete. Boom. Knocked out. Beat that battle and had one more to go. Richie: 2, Institvte: 0

And then it was time…

The 6.1200 final was almost as scary as my 5.111 (Chemistry) final. But if I survived 5.111 I lowkey could survive anything…including 6.1200. And I did.

- Tuesday. 6.1200. 1:30PM. Johnson Athletic Center. Just me, a third pencil I had to borrow from a friend (Spencer this time), and me praying that the 6.1200 professors would not force me to write a mathematical proof for why the sky is blue and the Earth is round (Though that probably would’ve been the nicer treatment)

- 3 hours later. 4:30PM. Test Complete. Boom. Knocked out somehow??. Beat that battle and won the second great finals war. Richie: 3, Institvte: 0.

 

FREEDOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM (I have 6 more finals seasons to go – plus who knows how many more for grad school💔)

Part 20: Impossible Challenge – Pack Your Whole Life Away in 24 Hours

After that final, I had about 24 hours to finish up on packing my room and getting all my stuff to our storage pod. But before that, Chocolate City had a little celebration for our seniors in the New House courtyard.

 

 

 

Part 21: This is Where I Yap About What I Learned and What Not

At the beginning of the year, DoingWell at MIT had us all write letters to ourselves that would automatically be sent to our MIT emails at the end of the year. This letter finally came back about a month ago and reading it pretty much summarizes all the different experiences I’ve had this past year. So instead of trying to write up some new summary, I’ll share that letter here in hopes that it explains all the ways I think I’ve changed this year and resonates with anyone going through some sort of new academic experience.


The following is a letter from the past. It was written on August 30, 2024 . Dear Future Me, By the time this message reaches you, I’m sure you’ve probably grown in ways you would’ve never expected yourself to. You’ve probably built communities and relationships with people that you never expected to become close with and have learned a lot about who you are along the way. By now you’ve probably realized how hard psets really are compared to how I think they are as I’m writing this. You’ve probably edited hundreds of photos and videos and posted blogs on the admissions page that have probably inspired people you will never meet. You’ve probably learned more about our world’s different systems and how you want to change it. You’re probably stressed right now. Or maybe you’re satisfied with everything. You may be confused or lost. But at the end of the day remember that getting to MIT was only a dream at some point that you ended up making happen. Cherish that. Be proud of it. And continue to find ways you can improve yourself and the lives of those around you. Nothing is too far out of your reach and the best time to start making change is now, but always remember the people that helped you along the way. Because without them, life wouldn’t be the same. Congratulations on making it through your first year and good luck on the rest!

for change in (expected + unexpected):,Allison E. '27,1,2025-06-19T00:00:00-04:00,"Before coming to MIT, I consumed a lot of Content™ about college. Probably too much content. Some of that was my own doing, whether it was YouTube advice videos or romanticized audiobooks or way too many of the MIT Admissions blogs (oops). But some of it was also partially unwilling, mainly via the endless stream of short-form videos spoonfed to me by various algorithms. Whether or not I consumed this content intentionally, though, it all added up to a lot of expectations—both conscious and subconscious—about what college would be like. Picnics on a sunny quad, aesthetic library study sessions, late night conversations… the list goes on.

But now I’ve been here for two years. At real college, not imaginary internet college! There’s been a lot of the ways my life has changed, both expected and unexpected, so I figured I should compile a (non-comprehensive) halfway-done list!

Expected — Weather

This is the one that everyone from [insert place without seasons] probably brings up way too much. I’m exceptionally guilty of this, because even though it’s completely expected, it’s still exciting and confusing and most definitely different. Most people who know I’m going to school in Boston remark on how cold it is, but the most jarring part isn’t actually the lower temperatures—it’s how abruptly the weather can change. At home, the closest I came to checking the weather was reading a school email once every month or two: “With the consideration of our current rainy conditions, I am letting you know that slippers are allowed for tomorrow”. Now, I have to check the weather every morning to decide how many layers to wear, whether to bring an umbrella, etc.

For reference, here’s some 
        snapshots
      
 of October weather in Cambridge vs. Honolulu:

As you can see, I was incredibly weather-spoiled at home. So far, though, the radically different weather has been really fun! I like cold weather much better than hot, and it’s fun to put together outfits with layers or snuggle under heavy blankets at night. Also, I LOVE SNOW.

Expected — Sleep Schedule

In high school I went to sleep around 10:30 pm, and woke up at 
        5:30 am.
      
 When some of my friends started college on the east coast, sometimes I’d text them in the evening, eventually signing off with an “I should go to sleep…” And then they’d say “I should probably do that too.”

Hawaii Standard Time is six hours earlier EST…

Based on that alone, it was pretty evident that college was going to change my very respectable high school sleep schedule. And, as my roommates can attest, it most certainly has—my bedtime is now around 3:00 am, and I wake up around 
        10:00 am
      
. In general, I’m getting about the same amount of sleep as in high school, but the problem is that I’m more naturally an early bird. That’s generally a very lucky thing to be at any time except for college. I feel more tired than the number of hours say I should, and when the days get short I’m sometimes only awake for three or four hours of sunlight…

In my defence, I do have classes or club meetings til 8:30 pm several days a week, and since most of my friends do as well, we’re mainly able to hang out late at night. Thankfully, most days my classes also start around 11:00 am, so I’m able to sleep in much later. But yeah, these are largely excuses. I could go to sleep at normal hours, but I think I’ll just wait til I graduate 😆

Expected — Schoolwork Difficulty

Everyone says that MIT is hard. 
        Everyone
      
 hears that MIT is hard, and everyone tries to prepare themselves for the fact that MIT is hard, and then everyone is sad when MIT is, in fact, hard. By everyone, I mean me. Freshman fall was great, because 
        PNR
      
 made the transition much less stressful, and last semester I tried my best (and I think succeeded at) renormalizing my expectations of grades away from the obsessive straight A’s. But that doesn’t mean MIT still isn’t hard 😭. I think the biggest challenge so far for me has been that PSet problems require much more creativity than I’m used to. A lot of them feel more akin (in spirit) to problems I’ve seen in math competitions like the AMC–except that for those tests, a score of 70% (on a multiple choice) might put you in the top 5% of competitors, so the pressure of solving any given problem isn’t as intense. PSets are often collaborative efforts, which definitely helps, but it’s still been something to adjust to. (It’s been two years). (I am not adjusted). (Send help).

Expected — Food

As hard as the folks over at Soylent are working to eliminate humanity’s constant need for food (I firmly disbelieve that Soylent belongs to this category), my body needs food. Several times a day. In reasonably large quantity. How to food?

As I’d heard before arriving, 
        MIT’s dining halls
      
 are decent, but tiring if repeated. I knew I’d want to start cooking relatively often, and cook I have! It’s been really fun playing with new recipes, cooking with friends, or trying to replicate foods from home (Hawaii has the BEST food and I will fight you on that). I’ve also re-confirmed my conviction that the best way to make friends is freshly baked cookies :)

Unexpected — Roommates

Dorm rooms! Roommates! Shared bathrooms! Oh my! This is probably the most archetypal aspect of the American college experience, and consequently the one for which I’ve been force-fed the most misleading content. After a thousand different TV shows and YouTube videos, I was under the impression that my college roommate, especially my freshman year roommate, would either become my best friend or my worst enemy. That they’d shape my college experience, the other friends I’d make, and the kind of person that I’d grow into. It felt like a lot of pressure for someone 
        randomly chosen out of a hat
      
, and I was worried that if I didn’t become best friends with my roommate, I’d be missing out on a core part of the college experience.

These are all lies. LIES, I TELL YOU! 

Ok, maybe not lies. There are definitely people who become incredibly close with their roommates, and people who have absolutely terrible experiences. It’s 100% worth the effort to try to get to know your roommate(s). But my freshman year roommates are not my best friends in the whole world. They’re amazing people, and were absolutely awesome to live with. But we weren’t attached at the hip like people are in the movies. And more importantly, I didn’t miss out on a core part of the college experience because of it. I made the most incredible friends outside of my dorm, and we had all those special moments without being roommates–4 am conversations in study rooms, giggling on couches in lounges, and cooking up monstrosities in dorm kitchens. And in a stroke of great luck, this past year I even got to move in with my bestest of friends, Miranda :D

Unexpected — Sleep Ability??

I’ve always had trouble falling asleep—nothing debilitating, but it always takes me a while. Because of this I was a little worried about falling asleep with roommates, especially since I was sleeping on the 
        earlier side
      
 for the first few months. Turns out, however, that I’m constantly just TOO TIRED for it to matter. I can now fall asleep in ten minutes with the lights on, people talking, and the window wide open, and I’ve even slept through an air mattress being blown up! I know that this doesn’t work out so nicely for everyone, so I’m really grateful that sleep is coming so easily to me now, but I guess occasionally our bodies are more adaptable than we think?

Unexpected — Confidence

I have never felt as confident and comfortable in my own skin as I do now. I think this is partly a function of being more social, and partly a function of being a nerd at a nerd school surrounded by nerds who think being a nerd is cool, but whatever the cause is, it’s great. I can make phone calls without needing a 20 minute cool-down period afterwards. I can strike up conversations with new people without running out of things to say three sentences in. I don’t think about laughing too loud with my friends, and if I feel like skip-run-dancing down dorm row, I’ll do it (…if it’s 4 am and the street is mostly empty). It’s an improvement from a very low baseline, but it’s still a step up that I didn’t expect. 

Unexpected — Social Needs & Energy

I’ve always considered myself an introvert, sticking to the corners of rooms or outskirts of social circles, and generally feeling self-conscious. Over the last two years of high school, I definitely became more social, and a lot more comfortable with putting myself out there, but it always felt like I was just getting better at cosplaying extroversion, or just learning more social skills. 

After my first couple months at MIT, though, I started to wonder if I wasn’t an introvert after all, but rather 
        a very shy extrovert
      
 that was finding their people and slowly coming out of their shell. Freshman fall was an avalanche of social situations, and somehow I was coming out of them with more energy than I went in with. It was just… so much fun. When I did start feeling tired, I tried my usual self-care method–staying in and relaxing–but it didn’t seem to do much. Instead, every outing with friends left me feeling refreshed and re-energized. More importantly, when I didn’t have time for those hang outs, I could feel the loneliness getting to me. A lot. 

The tail end of freshman spring was rough. I was busy, my friends were busy, and the chasms of time between being together were widening, widening, widening. I could feel my mental health falling into those gaps, and it was scary to realize that I was relying on other people for my happiness. How does one deal with that? Well, I guess by coming up with a weird personal pseudoscience to explain it:

The reason I think this change wasn’t an intrinsic, introvert -> extrovert change, but rather environmental factors bringing out dormant extroversion is that I’m now looking back at high school with slightly different eyes. I did get energy from some social situations, I just didn’t have the chance to hang out with those people often enough to notice. I’ve also realized that just ‘being around’ my friends–studying in the same room, sometimes silent, sometimes with some background chatter–is just as beneficial for me as going out on an excursion. I think the reason I never noticed my ambient social time needs is that in high school, I always had it. My friends had a specific table in the courtyard where we sat every day. Before school, between classes, during lunch, and oftentimes after school til 6:30 pm, many of us would be there working, or chatting, or relaxing. Last summer, as well, I was working in an office with two other interns, and there was the same ambient social energy to existing and working in the same space as other people. 

In the year since I figured this out, keeping an eye on my social needs has helped a lot with mental health, and having my best friend as my roommate this year also doesn’t hurt :D. All this to say, I maybe should’ve been more flexible about my identity as a supposed “introvert” and paid attention sooner to what my body/mind were actually telling me about my needs.

Unexpected — Drive and Ambition

Sometimes, I feel like I used up my whole gas tank in high school, and for the last two years I’ve been coasting on fumes and inertia. I don’t think this is unusual, but it’s not something that I fully expected, and not to 
        this degree
      
. I think some of it comes from MIT being such an intense place. I end up using most of my drive just to get through classes, and when everyone around you is doing absolutely insane things–things you know you literally aren’t capable of–it sometimes feels like it’s not worth striving at all.

That sounds terrible. And from many perspectives, it is terrible. But I’m not entirely unhappy with my “lack of drive.” Sometimes I think of it as an issue of diminishing marginal returns. If I put in the effort to do well in my classes, find decent-but-not-prestigious work opportunities, and generally develop useful skills, that’s plenty enough to set up a future. For every extra hour of grinding, the additional reward diminishes exponentially, and the total amount of time I’d have to spend turning myself into the model MIT intellectual is simply enormous. I’d get so much more utility out of that time if I spent it supporting my friends, or making music, or helping run a high school science tournament. More importantly, in the words of Hank Green, 
        “your own joy can be something you produce.”
      
 Sometimes, I just want to produce joy for myself and my friends, and I’m ok with that. Because it brings another change:

From East to West: An American’s Cross-Atlantic Voyage,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",3,2025-06-10T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m currently in the exotic land of England. Over a week ago, I flew into Heathrow Airport on a dragon, and then I rode with a group of knights from London to Bristol, where I currently reside in a castle.

I’m here through MISTI, or MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives. Through MISTI, students can either participate in internship programs with companies and labs all over the world, or teaching programs where students teach STEM and entrepreneurship at high schools in different countries.

Right now, I’m staying in Bristol with Anika (READ HER POST HERE), who’s another blogger! We’re both working in the Dexterous Robotics group at Bristol Robotics Laboratory, although we’re in different projects. It’s a relief that I’m staying with someone I know, since this is the first time I’ve ever been in the UK.

My journey involved three phases:

- Flying from Boston to London

- Taking the train from London to Bristol

- Taking an Uber from the station to the flat I’m staying in (I could’ve taken the bus, but I didn’t want to drag my luggage all over the place)

The Journey to Heathrow, Fortress of the Skies



The few days leading up to my flight to London were hectic. I was graduating, so along with the two ceremonies I went to, I was moving all over MIT and Boston with family. I finally got that damn diploma that I shed so many tears over. Then, I had to pack up everything that was left in my room, and I moved out of Next House. As someone who lived there for all four years of undergrad, it felt weird. But I’ll leave post-graduation feelings for another post.

I arrived at Logan International with Anika through a shared Uber, and then we went off to our separate gates — she was taking Delta, and I was taking British Airways. I pretty much bummed around at the gate for two hours, where I finished the rest of 
        Season 2 of The Rehearsal.
      
 Admittedly, I was getting nervous. This was my first solo international flight, after all.

Half an hour before boarding, an old man rushed over and sank down in the seat next to me. He closed his eyes and heaved a sigh. Turning to me, he grumbled, “Of all the airports I’ve been in, Logan International is on my shit list.”

He sounded a lot like David Sedaris, with a similar amount of his wit. He asked me if I’ve been to the UK before, and I told him that it was my first time. When I asked him how much he’s visited, he said, “Oh, many times. I was a medieval history major back in my post-doc years, so I’ve given tours for cathedrals and such. England is a lovely place.”

It was an uneventful flight, and therefore a good flight. I watched Madagascar and the first half of Pee-wee as Himself, and then I dozed off. Throughout the short moments where I was awake, the sky sped from sunset to sunrise in only a handful of hours, like the world outside was on fast-forward.



My brief stay at Heathrow Airport was also uneventful. I was tired and gassy (shh don’t tell anyone else) as I waited for my baggage. I glanced down at my phone.

No mobile data. Uh oh. I turned the airport Wi-Fi on and off. Still no data.

Kids, when you get an eSIM before an international flight, make sure that it’s properly activated. I had to do this once I got to the flat, where there was stable Wi-Fi.

The Ride to Faire Bristol



Although I was data-less, I luckily had the foresight to download my train tickets beforehand. 

I had to take two trains: through the 
        Heathrow Express
      
 from Heathrow Airport to Paddington Station, and then with the Great Western Railway from Paddington (London) to Bristol.

When I reached Paddington, I was greeted by a massive glass ceiling that arched over several terminals. I had half and hour to spare before my train arrived, so I tracked down the Paddington Bear statue for a quick picture. As I waited in an empty seat near the departure boards, I could feel sleepiness finally start to creep in.

PADDINGTON! I haven’t seen the movies

The train ride was about an hour and forty minutes, and I was asleep for the first half of it. But when I woke up, the English countryside was passing by my window. It was a landscape that I had only seen in TV shows and movies. It was beautiful. Horses and sheep occasionally dotted the fields. When the train went through Bath Spa Station, the track was surrounded by canals and elegant structures tucked between trees and hills.

Yeah, I don’t have anything else to say about this part of the trip. It was my favorite part, though.

By the time I arrived at the station, I was famished. The melon sticks I ate at Heathrow weren’t enough to fend off the hunger pangs. As I hauled my luggage through the place, a warm savory smell drifted from one of the stores. I was so hungry that it might as well have sent me floating through the air like a cartoon character.



Sure enough, it led me to a nearby pasty shop. Pasties are kind of like folded pies, which are usually filled with savory fillings like meat and vegetables. One of the women gathered behind the counter saw me and said, “Sorry, love, our card reader is broken so we only take cash.” But luckily, I exchanged some dollars for pounds back at Heathrow, so I bought a chicken/bacon/leek pasty. To this day, I haven’t found a pasty that was 
         as good as that one.
      
 Maybe it was the hunger that warped my senses, but it was the best thing I had eaten in weeks.

Taking Up Resydence Withinst Our Noble Keep (Under the Suprevision of Our Landlorde)



I took an Uber from Bristol to the flat. Back in the States, I told my landlord that I would arrive at the flat at around 2 PM. When I got there, it was 1:30 PM. With no mobile data to contact her over Whatsapp, I awkwardly lingered around the front door with my luggage. I wished that I had bought another pasty.

A car pulled into the parking lot next to the flat. A white-haired elderly man stepped out with a bag of groceries. Curious, he stood and peered at me for a few moments. I nodded and smiled, and he waved back with a soft smile. He headed into the flat that was two doors down from me, dropped off the bag, and then headed back into his car before driving off.

I squatted there and tried to bust out a blog post on Microsoft Word before the old man came back, half an hour later. It was 2 PM, with my landlord nowhere in sight. He stared at me for a few seconds longer than before. Walking over to me, he asked in a quiet voice, “Are you moving in?”

Smiling sheepishly, I said, “Yes, I’ll be staying here for the summer. I’m waiting for my landlord.”

“Oh dear. You’ve been waiting for quite a while.”

And then, he says The Phrase.

“…would you like a cup of tea?”



 

If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve said, “Oh, I’m fine. But thank you!” Because why would I go into some guy’s apartment if I didn’t even know them?

But, this was not the United States. This past semester, all of the students in the MISTI UK program had to attend a handful of training sessions, where our program coordinator Stephen taught us that “Would you like a cup of tea?” is not just a question about drink preference, but a gesture of friendship and even comfort. To reject the Cuppa Tea is to reject such a gesture, to signal that I was not interested in establishing some semblance of social connection.

Heeding Stephen’s advice, I accepted. With a warm smile, the neighbor let me into his apartment. 

The Neighbours



Now, you should be wary of stranger danger. I don’t want to set a bad example and say that I had a 
        “feeling”
      
 that this would be a harmless encounter, especially since I didn’t have phone service. But, since I’m writing this alive and well, I have the privilege to recount what happened.

The man fixed me up a Cuppa Tea, which actually ended up being a glass of orange juice. We sat down on his couch with a polite distance between us, awkwardly sitting there in silence. I thanked him for the Cuppa Tea. I asked him if I could call my landlord, and he says, “Oh, I don’t have one of those handheld phones, but I have a landline over there if you would like.” He motions to an off-white plastic landline, next to a wooden old-fashioned radio and a pile of album covers for a band called The Drifters.

I usually get stiff around older people out of the fear that I’ll set a bad example for Generation Z, but I was even stiffer around this man. I was still trying to figure out English social cues, and I didn’t want to repulse this kind old man with American brashness. So, I tried out some light conversation.

“This is my first time in England,” I admitted.

His eyes grew wide. “You’ve never been in England?” he said, in quiet awe. “I’ve lived in England all my life,” he said, his eyes still wide.

Eventually, I said that I should check if my landlord is here. The man said, “Oh, I can take you to Matt, who lives nearby. He’ll probably have her number, since she used to live here.”

He led me to the other side of the row of flats, where he introduced me to a couple in their 30’s. They were quite friendly as well. “This is her first time in England!” the old man added as Matt let me borrow his phone. Right at that moment, my landlord pulled her car over by the street and hurried over to me. “I’m so sorry, my love!” she called. She wrapped me in a warm hug. “I was getting one of your keys copied, and it was taking longer than I thought!”

She gestured towards the old man. “And I see you’ve met Martin! He used to be my neighbor when I was here.”

“This is her first time in England!” Martin said, with the same amount of awe as before.

“Yeah!” my landlord said. “She’s from America! Isn’t that exciting?”

“Oh!” he said, his eyes growing wide with fascination. “I’ve never been to America. Would not like to, either.”

Not only does Bristol have rich 
        artistic history,
      
 but I’ve heard that Bristolians are known for being friendly and open. Even then, I didn’t expect the warm welcome I would receive from my neighbors on my very first day. I spent my last three summers on MIT’s campus as a student researcher, and as much as I enjoyed staying in Boston, I’m really glad I stepped out of my comfort zone to spend this summer in Bristol.

[Joint Post] THE WORLD’S gREATEsT CROSSOVER EPISODE,Anika H. '26,6,2025-06-04T00:00:00-04:00,"Note: Anika drew Anika and Jebby drew Jebby. If you can’t tell who’s who in the following series of pictures, you haven’t read enough blogs.

 

Everything is jarringly British in Bristol (wow what a shock). I know I’m in the UK, but it’s still surprising when I go to play a song and get an ad for body wash where everyone is talking with a British accent. The names are fascinating too. Under any other circumstance, I would have a hard time believing that Nempnett Thrubwell and Coombe Dingle are names of real places.

I’ve been here for two days and I’m really happy about my living situation, mostly because I’m in the same apartment with Jebby ’25 who’s chill and cool and awesome and super chill.

a place of culture

I’m scared to act as weirdly as I normally do in fear of contributing to the “loud unrestrained American” stereotype, so I did a bit of cultural research, including searching up a list of cuss words and their relative offensiveness so I can know what to avoid. I swear casually around my friends at home and I heard some cursing in the lab, so it might be somewhat okay, but you can never be too careful.

In public, Jebby and I both try to act normal, but at home we can use dudebro language and act as unhinged as we want. Based on observations, we can agree that we share half a braincell when we’re within the vicinity of each other.

 

Cooked or are we cookin’?

Considering the general reputation of British food, we decided it was best to cook most of our time here. Despite the expense of housing eating up most of our stipends, groceries were surprisingly cheap. After too many days of not eating real food, I was craving meat, so our first meal was a huge plate of salmon and eggs.

cooking our first meal in the UK

We ran into some issues in the kitchen though. There was no kitchen knife. I was stuck sawing through fish and raw potatoes with a butter knife until my collarbone hurt. Jebby got stuck in the corner spending an entire hour peeling 4 potatoes with the “peeler” that came with the kitchen supplies. You could probably peel faster with a seashell. We made it work though.

I think I tasted heaven in that first meal. I have drastically improved my cooking abilities since freshman year back when I was making rice cooker cocoa. Now, I’m proud to say I cooked so hard I knocked someone out cold for several hours (Jebby got a food coma because she ate so much because it was so good).

The Heeby Jebby’s

One thing I notice without fail whenever I travel somewhere are the local insects. I’ve caught at least 5 different species of spiders in California, more roaches than I can count on my hands in Boston, and have been absolutely fascinated by the fireflies and rhinoceros beetles in Italy.

Here, there seem to be a lot of stinkbugs and tiny little leafhoppers. We occasionally see an ant crawling around the kitchen, but I am glad that it is normal-sized and not the 1cm-long horse ants found further in the UK.

I love bugs. Jebby does not. She did not enjoy Noodle’s presence at all. I’m convinced she would be fine with the roach if it was more realistic, since the high saturation of the print made the bottom look really fleshy. Fortunately for her, I sleep with it at night so it stays in my room most of the time.

Blogaholics anonymous

Hanging around another blogger regularly gave me a lot more motivation to blog, hence why you’re seeing two blogs in a week. Maybe I’ll run out of steam later in the summer as my internship picks up, but I hope it’ll last for at least a few more blogs. You’ll hear about my time at Bristol Robotics Lab some other time. >:D

Unless we are #artsy#inspired, Jebby and I both take frequent breaks blogging because creativity takes a lot of energy.

MIT Bloggers Sniped Wrapped,Kayode D. '27,20,2025-06-02T00:00:00-04:00,"At MIT, a lot of groups use Slack to stay connected. It’s like a big series of group chats for work stuff or class materials. What’s really cool is that you can make separate tabs for different topics. It’s kind of like discord for your dad.

Most groups have a general announcements tab, some for different subgroups, one for random or fun things that happen, and [often among student groups] a stalking channel. This is where you put photos of other people in the group whenever you see them in the wild. A bit of jolly fun, right? [💀💀💀💀💀FORESHADOWING 💀💀💀💀💀]

I’m in three different stalking channels. One for Cru, one for Orientation Captains, and one for the MIT Admissions Bloggers team. So I thought it would be fun to do a blogger wrapped of the stalked photos we took!

Since the beginning of the channel on December 7th, 2024, there have been 91 snipes submitted to the channel. AND I WAS 30 OF THEM.

 

As you can see, I was in the channel an alarming amount.

And who was taking all of these photos, I hear you asking?

Hm. As I thought.

So there you have it! Janet and Ellie are the best lurkers/snipers on the MIT Blogs. Sometime I spot them ducking behind bushes or into trash cans like Nat Geo Wild photographers. Of course, I can’t slander the good name of Janet without giving her a chance to explain herself [in the form of a 200 character apology tweet]:

 “tbh i think it’s a skill issue kayode let’s be fr. anyway, plz treat this as the reason for why i haven’t written anything in the past 3 months ! i swear i’m cooking. my next blog is gonna be about t”

 “tbh i think it’s a skill issue kayode let’s be fr. anyway, plz treat this as the reason for why i haven’t written anything in the past 3 months ! i swear i’m cooking. my next blog is gonna be about t”

Ok, here’s photos stalkers took of me this year:

 

 

But ultimately, I still had the arguable best snipe of all:

Vindication.

 

So when the blogger applications open later this summer, think carefully. You may just end up with a group chat full of stalkers [who are all lovely people, but nevertheless stalkers].","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Most-Sniped.png

All the 2025 i3 videos megapost,Ceri R. '16,0,2025-06-02T00:00:00-04:00,"As a part of MIT’s unconventional housing process, rising first-year students typically consult the MIT Guide to Residences while they fill out their housing survey and choose where to live on campus.

This guide includes the Interactive Introduction to the Institute (I3) videos, which are produced by students to show off the community, physical spaces, and unique traditions of their residence halls. In the ’90s and early ’00s, these I3 videos were recorded to VHS tapes, and later DVDs, and mailed to adMITs, but with the advent of YouTube/Vimeo/etc they are now posted online (alongside tours!)

I’ve embedded all the 2025 i3 videos below in case you would like a glimpse into how MIT students describe their own communities to kindred spirits that they hope to live with. (A note that not all communities produce a video every year, so these aren’t comprehensive of all the housing options at MIT!) You can learn more about all the residence halls, and see more videos from previous years, at the MIT Guide to Residences.","https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSY4cMDWRPA

[liveblog] morbing at the airport,Anika H. '26,13,2025-06-01T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m doing a misti internship in the uk this summer, so I’m at the airport to fly out. I have been stuck in purgatory (aka. boston logan airport) for so long that blogging is the only thing that can keep me sane. the toilet got clogged and the gripping plot is slowly revealed over the course of the next many painful hours.

Is the blog still live: Nope (last update 7:05pm EST)

Am I there yet: Yes!

Hours in the airport: ~17

Hours on plane: 7

Gate changes: 4

Help desks visited: 3

Candies eaten: 9

Tears shed: not yet

People punched: thankfully none

 

4:15pm (etd 6:35pm)

i get to the airport with jebby. we’re planning on rooming together in the uk but we took separate flights.

 

6:35pm (etd 8:15pm)

the flight was supposed to takeoff. we get an announcement from the captain that we’re experiencing delays due to “lavatory blockage maintenance”. translating from corporate to normal speak, it means the toilet is clogged and they’re desperately trying to fix it so that people don’t have to hold their business in for the entirety of the 6 hour flight.

 

8:30pm (etd 10:15pm)

i’m still stuck in the airport after an imaginary gate change, a real gate change, and at least two more hours to go before i get on the plane to amsterdam. i’ve already missed the connecting flight to bristol.

oh, but it’s okay! because delta airlines gave me a 12 dollar food voucher! i can get 2.5 entire granola bars from the airport. definitely enough for dinner.

$4.40 granola bars

the two poor employees at the counter for our flight have been swarmed by concerned passengers for the past hour, and i’ve passed several groups of people discussing whether they want to cancel and switch flights. nobody’s having a good time, but i’m probably having a better time than the engineers stuck trying to unclog the toilet.

i’m hungry but don’t really know what to use the meal voucher on. if anyone is alive on the internet right now, you should put food suggestions in the comments :p

 

9:00pm (etd 10:15pm)

the brainrot has gotten to me

there’s no one in the comments, but a friend suggests i go find a dunkin or mcdonalds nearby. we change gates again.

 

10:02pm (etd 11:15pm)

we haven’t started boarding, so it’s probably going to get delayed again. dunkin’ was closed, so i got 8-piece dumplings with the voucher. It cost all 12 dollars save a quarter.

 

11:08pm (etd 12:05am)

i am dead. i am dying. on my grave it shall read anika huang, death by airport. we changed gates for the 4th time and the flight is still delayed.

in the hour i was not posting, i went out to the presecurity area to find the delta help desk to ask about changing flights. they said there was one two-plane flight at the same time, same locations tomorrow, and several three-plane flights tomorrow, which would require two layovers. given the option, i would ask to rebook straight to the london airport, but if my current flight doesn’t get cancelled, then my bag would still get sent to the bristol airport. i think i’m going to try and wait it out for another hour. if there is no good update, i’ll probably have to find a flight tomorrow, take the hotel voucher, and then cry myself to sleep.

the dumplings were sad, i am sad, and the toilet is probably still sad. it is known that boeings’ doors fall off mid-flight, but let it also be know that airbuses are prone to toilet problems.

i’m melting into a little puddle on the floor as jebby arrives in london within the next hour and i am still stuck in boston.

ellie has given me the idea in the comments that someone may be competitively pooping against the employees unclogging the toilet.

 

11:27pm (etd 12:05am)

i heard someone at the counter say it’s fixed! they just have to have the flight attendants and pilots go through security again or something. it’ll likely be delayed a little bit more, but it’s definitely not getting cancelled anymore. then again, i’d rather not get my hopes up in case things go to shit (haha gettit) again.

 

11:43pm (etd 1:00am)

his name is noodle

i briefly chatted with one of the passengers, and she said that she heard it was a baby bottle stuck in the toilet. while I’m glad no one had a catastrophic world-ending bowel movement, i’m also disappointed that someone lacked the common sense to know bottles go in the trash can. i take back my previous statement, i don’t think this is airbus’s fault

i have now spent 7.5 hours in the airport with only my cockroach plushie for emotional support. send help.

 

11:54pm (etd 1:00am)

the crew and the pilots just arrived at the gate! a round of applause broke out since we were now sure the flight was not cancelled. the guy working the front counters (plural because we switched gates so many times) for this flight finally got a break and went to go sit down on one of the chairs to have a well-deserved sip of apple juice.

 

12:24am (etd 1:00am)

boarding starts

 

1:40am

takeoff. as soon as the seatbelt sign turned off, i went and found an empty row to sleep in. i fell asleep intermittently for 5 hours, but as far as airplane sleep goes, it was pretty good.

 

1:30pm Local time in Amsterdam (7:30am EST)

landed in amsterdam. they rebooked my flight for 8:35am tomorrow, and by then my job would have already started. i stuff my cockroach plushie in my bag, grab my skateboard, and hurry off to a transport help desk.

 

2:17pm CET

i hear amsterdam is a beautiful city, what a shame I CANT LEAVE THE AIRPORT. if i took the rebooked flight, i would be stuck at another godforsaken airport for another 19 hours on top of the 9 i already suffered. i’m waiting in line for the help desk, so hopefully they can get me a sooner flight so i don’t have to awkwardly explain to my supervisor that i missed my first day because a toilet got clogged.

 

2:50pm CET

they managed to get me on a flight at 10pm. it’s in 7 hours, which is better than 19. This means I can still make it to work on time and get some sleep before that.

pro tip: if your flight gets really delayed, ask for food vouchers. there are also usually refund/reimbursement forms for incurred expenses that you can fill out.

im probably going to find somewhere to take a nap, get food, then explore the airport a little bit.

 

4:47pm CET

what i thought i was going to get

the pancakes that i got

 

i suppose airport food is sad everywhere. i saw mini pancakes up on a menu, and they looked really good, but they were about a tenth of the size the screen implied they were. tasted like a pancake. 6/10 (2/10 accounting for size)

 

 

 

 

5:19pm CET

gumdrops

red raspberry candy

holland candy mix

i got 10 euros worth of candy, and i intend for this to last me at least an entire month. there was a bit of variety, so i tried a little bit of each. the hard candies take a bit to melt so i’m still working through them.

the butter waffle is my favorite by far, but there are still two more i haven’t tried.

 

 



7:58pm CET (etd 9:50)

woke up from a nap. surprisingly good for table sleep. the gate information still isn’t here, which is a little weird because there’s only two hours left until i’m supposed to fly.

 

9:15pm CET (etd 9:50)

i am now typing on my phone because i didn’t have a eu adapter for my computer charger, and my laptop ran out of battery. i got some more food (good ol’ mcdonalds) and came to the gate. it looks like the flight is still on time, and boarding is going to start within the next few minutes.

as i wandered the airport, i saw some of the netherlands’ finest exports, including miffy (one of my favorite bunnies as a kid), tulips, wooden clogs, syrup waffles, and tony’s chocolonely. the latter had an entire store, but to be fair, it is really good chocolate.

big miffy is watching you

 

9:25pm CET (etd 9:50)

letsgooooo the gate is open! we’re on time baby

10:02pm Bristol

landed in bristol! i got stopped by customs, so it took slightly longer than expected getting out, but it didn’t take too long. the only thing they seemed surprised by was the very large, very soft cockroach.

i think i’ve learned a few things:

1. advocate for yourself. had i not yapped incessantly about needing to get to work tomorrow morning and being really hungry because of the delays, i would have had to spend another night at the airport starving. you would have witnessed more victorian dramaticism happening in this blog. if something unfair or unreasonable is happening to you, complain about it. that being said, don’t be rude, which brings me to my next point.

2. be kind to service employees. they work long days dealing with angry people and are probably not paid well enough. if you’ve had a bad day, they’re likely having one too. a little compassion and a lot of thank you’s go a long way.

3. skateboards are great for airports, especially if you are on a time crunch or plan to scour a large area for food. i zoomed around a lot, but did so carefully. skate slower around more people, avoid skating close to store entrances, and pay attention to your surroundings. also, if you’re going at breakneck speeds, you’ll probably get yelled at. i went at a relatively reasonable pace.

4. bring a soft thing. very good for naps. noodle was a great nap companion.

 

12:05am


I am alive and in Bristol, and I haven’t lost anything but my sanity. Jebby beat me by 11 hours to the apartment, but sweet reunions never come easy.

friendful,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",1,2025-05-30T00:00:00-04:00,"one of my labmates has a friend from elementary school who was on the latest season of love on the spectrum. another labmate watched it and told me it was really sweet how that person described their experience in elementary school as “filled with friends.”

i think that’s how my life can be described right now. filled with friends. friendful, if you will.

after five years at mit, i can say i feel more settled into myself than ever before. i’ve come to peace with a lot of the things that kept me up late at night in my early years here. i treat myself like i would an old friend. i take my shortcomings in stride and i don’t shy away from acknowledging my good qualities. i know myself and my limits, my patterns and my dreams. i generally know what i want and i take care of myself a lot better.

i’ve mellowed out, in a sense — the furious emotional ups and downs of my late teen whirlwind years are far behind me, but it doesn’t mean i disparage my younger self for behaving that way. they just had a lot of growing to do, and that’s something that can only come with time. now, i have more things in my emotional toolbox to pull from when i’m faced with challenges. of course i still have bad days and low points, but i’m genuinely amazed by how well i’m able to bounce back and keep facing forward rather than get stuck in a self-destructive loop.

i think younger mel would be pretty proud of how far i’ve come.

i’ve been thinking a lot about community in the past few months. mostly, how i wouldn’t be where i am now without the incredible people i’ve met along the way. and i know that can sound trite, but i genuinely mean it.

i think that i have a tendency to self-isolate when i’m not doing well, and that means texts and emails go unanswered for long periods. maybe it’s a bit of a pride thing — i can’t let others know that i’m struggling — but lately i’ve been leaning into asking for help when i need it. thinking about the steadfast support and love and sense of community i’ve received in all aspects makes me weepy, whether it’s:

- my grad student mentor getting me cake pops (all three flavors, because she didn’t know which one i’d like) and taking me out to boba after a rough night

- a labmate making me a seven hour long playlist

- people being willing to help me do timed transfers in my experiments so that i can run to meetings or appointments or grab lunch

- bonding over 80s new wave music with a labmate who then gifted me a depeche mode hat from a concert he went to in the 2000s

- talking about birding with my pi (apparently i missed the migratory peak but now i know that mt. auburn cemetery is a hotspot for birders!)

- joanna always being willing to grab lunch in kendall square or come to the whitehead institute (where i work) and hang out with me as i wrangle my worms or make spontaneous plans to get dinner and drinks and go out and talk about absolutely everything and anything

- shu going out of their way to visit me this weekend from new york (!!) and always being my number one fan on twitter and beli

- random chats with my roommates rui and tiffany who i will miss so so dearly when they are off in california (and my cat will miss them a lot too)

- having breakfast at brookline lunch with antara and supporting each other through the wild ups and downs this semester and attending her undergraduate thesis presentation

- hanging out with kat and andoni and luna at pika just like the good old days on florey

- every single conversation i’ve had with august and alex, ever

- getting advice from cami on certain matters of the heart

- going to the poetry store in harvard square with alan and getting gelato from amorino and sitting by the river under the cherry blossoms

- eating summer rolls with kelly in porter square and waffles from zinneken’s and going to vintage stores

- going to craft circles with lauren and leah and bonding over our love for fiber arts

- all of the incredible scientific mentors i’ve had who inspire me immensely

- joining wmbr in my last stretch at mit and being welcomed with opened arms

- the council of yuri…

- and so so so so much more.

i don’t know, man. this is probably going to be my last post as an official blogger — i’ll be finishing my meng in the summer (and i do have a couple more posts planned for that), but blogging will no longer be My Job™ once the clock strikes june 1st. the blogs were my very first community at mit, and i’ve watched them grow and change in so many ways in the past few years. i’m the last member of my blogging cohort left, which is completely insane.

i think i used to post a lot of sad things. i think i was figuring myself out. and i still haven’t figured myself out yet completely, but i have a much better understanding of how my brain works, and how i move through the world, and how other people fit into that picture.

what makes a blog a mel blog is a wistful little statement of hope at the very end. looking back at the endings of my old posts, it’s interesting how you can see me become more sure of myself over time.

- “drink it slowly and let the warmth remind you that you are loved, and that no matter what the universe tries to throw at you, you will find a way to handle it” (hot chocolate as a panacea)

- “You are so loved. Just hang in there.” (dear past me)

- “For now, I think I just have to hang on tight and keep surviving.” (bday burnout)

- “i tend to end my posts with a vague statement of hope, and this one is no different. i’d like to think that i’m an optimistic person. i hope for the best.” (all time ever does is pass)

- “I’ve completed one more cycle. I think I’m ready to start the next one.” (butterfly season)

- “My life is changing every day. Some days it feels like an unpredictable wildfire. Other days, when the flames have subsided and the rain starts to fall, I look down and see hints of green beneath my feet.” (from me to you)

- “But I’m trying, and there are people who think I’m doing enough, and I think that’s enough.” (me, existing)

- “you want to be okay.” (romanticize a quiet life)

- “And now I’m going to tell you that I love you, and that people love you, and that you are worthy and deserving of love that doesn’t make you feel like you’re sinking, and by telling you all of this I’m also trying to tell myself this, and maybe if I say it enough I’ll believe it.” (love languages)

- “I’m glad that I’m here.” (2024 ring premiere)

- “Because it’ll be okay. I’m really hoping it will be okay.” (tryharding)

- “I think I am trying to be more comfortable in my loneliness every time it decides to visit me again.” (ode to grocery stores)

- “we move forward, not backwards. and it will be okay.” (my problem list)

- “i’m doing things that i’m genuinely interested in. and that’s more important than anything.” (taking care)

- “i’m less lost than i was, which i’m proud of, and i hope that in the future i will become less lost than i am now, and i think that i will be okay.” (baby steps)

- “i have people who love me and want to support me and it’s okay to take things at my own pace. and it’ll be okay. probably. hopefully. maybe. i guess i just have to keep chugging along.” (contradictions)

- “you’re doing a really good job. these things take time.” (november again)

- “You miss the way things were. But you’ve come so far.” (learning how to drive)

- “i’ll handle the roadbumps as they come. i know i will.” (shifting seasons)

- “i think i can make it.” (real things)

so, here it is. a message to me and to you.

you are loved. you can and will find a way to handle anything that comes up. there are so many people who are cheering for you.

you will be okay. i’m sure of it.",,0

[Joint Post] Interviewing Two MIT Physics Heroes,Richard O. '28,0,2025-05-30T00:00:00-04:00,"This year, MIT learned that two beloved members of our community would be leaving the institute at the end of the year. Professor Peter Dourmashkin and Lecturer Mohamed Abdelhafez are two physics teachers that have supported the education of physics at MIT in a myriad of ways. From developing the TEAL structure of the 8.01 (Classical Mechanics) and 8.02 (Electricity and Magnetism) subjects that most all MIT students take to giving up hours of their time to making sure students feel comfortable with the course material, both professors have contributed so much to the physics community here on campus and beyond.

The VIPs themselves.

 

So, with that, fellow blogger Kano and I decided to conduct an interview to document their stories and transcribe them in a blog so that we could highlight the kinds of people that make MIT, MIT.

 

… and the interviewers in the beloved light room!

 

We hope this blog captures the impact that these two professors have had on our institute in their time here and provides a little glimpse into these two lives that the MIT community would not be the same without.

Introductions:

Peter Dourmashkin is a senior Lecturer who came to MIT in 1972. After attaining his PhD, Peter began working at MIT in 1984 in a number of different MIT educational initiatives ranging from the Terrascope program and Integrated studies program to Project Interphase and teaching in the Physics Department. “Eventually, the physics department said, ‘just concentrate on physics — just do that.’ So, I’ve been here a long time,” Peter said. Peter’s last day at the institute is July 31st, 2025.

 

Mohamed Abdelhafez is a lecturer in the physics department who has been with MIT for six years. Mohamed originally hails from Egypt where he completed his undergraduate degree and attended the University of Chicago to attain a PhD in physics. During his time at the University of Chicago, Mohamed realized he was more interested in education than research and came to MIT to pursue that passion. “I wanted to shift more into teaching and I was lucky that I got a postdoc here at MIT in physics education research,” he said. Mohamed has been teaching at MIT since 2019 and his last day will be July 1st, 2025.

 

MIT Experience

 

Following the introductions, we then asked both lecturers about their personal experiences with MIT. 

Following the introductions, we then asked both lecturers about their personal experiences with MIT. 

 

When asked about what they love the most about the Institute, Mohamed replied saying there were two things: The first thing was students. “I love MIT students. I feel like there is a very special connection between me and MIT students,” he said. “Students here are very motivated and very interactive and appreciative. They shaped me into who I am, really.” The second thing that Mohamed stated was the excitement that exists on MIT’s campus. “There is always something new and exciting happening. Nothing is static here. You have to be on your toes all the time and listen to new ideas.” 

 

In Peter’s response, Peter discussed the value he finds in being able to make an impact in the lives of the students he teaches. “When I go elsewhere, people ask me: ‘what do I do?’ […] I just basically say it’s an incredible privilege to teach at MIT because we do have some of the best students in the United States,” Peter said. Peter then went on to describe a story of an encounter he had with a previous student of his who had told him and his wife that Peter had helped him pass his 8.01 course which allowed him to become a computer science major. “And that’s just really satisfying. It has just really been a privilege. I consider myself incredibly lucky that I managed to stay here for this long,” he added.

 

We then asked the two about their first impression of MIT when they arrived. 

We then asked the two about their first impression of MIT when they arrived. 

 

Peter explained how he had initially been shocked with the environment upon arrival, not having originally been from a city, but then started to find people who made his experience more interesting. “So it was a transition period. Over time, you meet so many interesting people, it’s amazing,” Peter said. 

 

Mohamed then followed by explaining how, when he first came, he had fears of not being able to adequately support the students. “I was very scared that I didn’t have the necessary background to teach those kids,” Mohamed said. He then went on to explain how, very quickly, he realized that just like any other student, MIT students can struggle in physics classes too. “MIT students are very special and each of them in their own different way, but not all of them were finding physics, for example, very easy. On the contrary, I would say the majority actually have some struggles with physics and math – just like anywhere else,” Mohamed said.

 

Teaching Physics:

 

Zooming into their experiences on campus, we then wanted to focus on their experience in the classroom by asking them about their favorite memory from teaching physics. 

Zooming into their experiences on campus, we then wanted to focus on their experience in the classroom by asking them about their favorite memory from teaching physics. 

 

Mohamed started by explaining his experience leading to his first few exam review sessions while working as a graduate TA (Teaching Assistant)  under Peter. Peter added, “I remember Mohamed and I did it together. I remember just saying, okay, Mohamed, now you do this.” Mohamed then explained how he felt pretty nervous before the first review but then reassured himself that he had done the best he could to help the students when the review was over. For the second review session, however, Mohamed described his shock when he was welcomed by a hallway packed with almost 200 students. “I didn’t really believe that this was happening. I think that right there, I told them: ‘I think this will be my peak.’ […] But wow, there were maybe 200 students all thinking that this is helping them. So yeah, I always remember that night.”

 

Peter then answered by describing moments where students would work out problems on their own in the classroom and he could walk around and have conversations with them. “That type of connection is the feeling that it’s not a lecture, it’s a learning community, and that’s really special.” Peter then discusses how he really enjoys the moments where he sees a student is struggling and is able to say something that changes the way they approach the problem that leads to those ‘aha’ moments. “All those things, they just add up,” he said.

 

After this, we shifted to a discussion about physics as a subject and asked the two what their favorite concepts/topics were from 8.01 and 8.02.

After this, we shifted to a discussion about physics as a subject and asked the two what their favorite concepts/topics were from 8.01 and 8.02.

 

Peter answered with, “rotation translation of rigid bodies from 8.01” and described a class demo that’s usually done using a bicycle wheel that’s spun and then allowed to skid and roll along the floor. “We do a special case of it, with a fixed axis, but it generalizes to some really elegant and beautiful mathematics at the same time,” Peter said. He then added that Faraday’s law was his favorite from 8.02 because it has the most demonstrations and is the most historically misunderstood. 

 

Mohamed followed by explaining his appreciation for the abstraction that comes with 8.02, especially with Gauss’s law, having been a theoretical physicist and having a deep interest in mathematics. “Gauss’s law is a big mathematical abstract idea. You have to construct imaginary surfaces and stuff. So I love the first layer of abstraction that comes with Gauss’s law,” he said. Mohamed then added that Faraday’s law and the assembling of Maxwell’s equations were also his favorite because they provided an, “elegant way of describing the whole course.”

 

From here, we went on to ask how they had felt the teaching of Physics has changed in their time at MIT.

Mohamed explained how the implementation of learning sequences, which are online modules with videos and questions to introduce students to new topics before lecture, has improved since his arrival to campus. “I think that model has been refined year by year by Peter and other members in the group and I think now we have a better model than we had before,” Mohamed said. 

 

Peter then answered by explaining how the entire TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) format of the physics courses had started and been improved gradually during his time at MIT. The format of TEAL, according to Peter, was based on several different teaching models across different universities, and, over time, saw improvements such as the introduction of undergraduate TAs to bridge the gap between students and staff as well as the lightboard that’s used in the learning sequence videos. “So when you ask how the course changed, there were a hundred little changes like that since the very beginning,” Peter stated.

After hearing about all the thoughtfulness that went into the decisions made for the course, we then wanted to know if either of the lecturers had a favorite physics joke.

Peter replied describing a moment he has with students where they’re working with objects on an inclined plane. During this unit, sometimes Peter would usually approach a group of students and ask them which cylinder they feel will reach the bottom of the incline first. Knowing that the students would often know the correct answer and choose that one, he then holds the two cylinder at the top but then releases the one that they didn’t choose ahead of the other cylinder so that it reaches the bottom first while holding the cylinder they did choose. “So sometimes I’ll intentionally say things that aren’t right, because you have to break out of that mindset. You have to think independently and challenge everything that people say and decide whether it’s true for yourself. So sometimes I like to shake up the class that way, and that’s always fun. I love that,” Peter said. 

 

Hearing this enjoyable moment, we then followed up with a question asking how the two would describe their relationship with the student body.

Mohamed started by describing the feeling as magic. He explained how he struggled to understand the immense appreciation that’s been shown to him from students and how whenever a new cohort of students starts taking the physics GIR’s (General Institute Requirements) they immediately develop a sort of trust in him. “There is a huge trust in me, and I trust them. I really value this mutual trust,” Mohamed said. 

 

Peter followed by emphasizing the trust students have in Mohamed, stating how Mohamed’s work is usually done for the students in a selfless way. “He’s there to help the students learn. He’s not there maybe to show how smart he is or how much he knows and that’s immediately obvious and you can see that with personal interactions with people,” Peter said. Peter also added a comment describing his appreciation for Mohamed’s fast response time on the platform Piazza which is a tool that students can use to submit public or private questions to course staff about homework or course material. “When students ask Piazza questions, sometimes I’m sitting there and I see it. I’m getting ready to write an answer, but Mohamed’s already answered!” 

Peter then explained how spending so much time at the institute has changed his interaction with the students from when he was only a few years older than them to being much older than them. Looking ahead, however, he expressed excitement for the future of the current physics education group. “At this stage in my career, I consider it a huge accomplishment that the physics department has made a commitment to education,” he stated.

 

 

We then went on to ask a question for the blogger audience not on MIT campus that would hope to take a physics class at MIT one day and asked if the lecturers had any advice for these students.

Peter began by highlighting the importance of keeping a positive mindset. Having been an undergraduate at MIT himself, Peter explained how coming to MIT for the first time can make it really easy to experience imposter syndrome, but then explained how having the right framework of mind can make one’s time here all the more exciting. Peter then emphasized the numerous resources available for students in 8.01 and 8.02. “Everybody is an MIT student, and each person will realize their own potential. And so you don’t have to compare yourselves to other people. You just want to have a really positive attitude. Then when you graduate, you realize, ‘Wait a second, how did it go so fast?,’” Peter said.

Mohamed seconded everything Peter had said while urging the importance of getting stuck on a problem and not being hesitant to ask for help. In describing the learning process, Mohamed states that, “it’s okay to be stuck and spend some time on a problem and then ask for some help. Take your time to be stuck and to struggle a little bit, and that helps you. Without that, you’re not going to grow.”

 

Personal Life and Looking Ahead

 

In this section we wanted to learn a little more about the personal aspects of their lives and we began by asking if the two had any hobbies outside of physics. 

In this section we wanted to learn a little more about the personal aspects of their lives and we began by asking if the two had any hobbies outside of physics. 

 

Peter started by explaining how he had to postpone a number of activities since he began teaching physics. “We wrote a book on the physics of bicycling, but now I have to update it to eBikes and motors because we wrote it in the early eighties,” Peter said. Peter also added that he was really interested in the intersection of mathematics and music and he plans to continue playing the piano and pursuing his music passion by taking music theory courses. 

 

Mohamed followed by sharing his deep love for Arabic music. “I want to start a YouTube channel or something for the Arabic audience.” Additionally, Mohamed is a big fan of soccer and stated that he enjoys following the English Premier League but also added that he has a third passion for programming where he often uses programming in the context of his other two passions. “So I’ve written code for music that I’m playing on my own keyboard. And I also have written code for soccer for the Premier League. I’m a very big fan of just putting my brain into something that can help people, especially in the places where I’m passionate about.”

 

During this discussion of programming, Peter also pointed out that in his time at the Institute, Mohamed has had a significant hand in developing code that has helped to improve the organization needed in the backend of the physics courses. “Mohamed’s written a huge amount of code that has totally simplified my life and saved hours and hours and hours in terms of the backend of the course,” Peter stated. 

 

Building off the idea of passions and hobbies, we then asked how the two would unwind after a long day of working at MIT.

Peter listed several activities that included walking, talking, and cooking with his wife, playing the piano, taking care of his cat, as well as tending to a garden. “I might put an hour in the garden every day. It’s very meditative to get the soil in your hands and I like that a lot,” Peter said.

 

Mohamed then told us about his two daughters and how he would spend time with them after picking them up from school and then begin working after they fell asleep. With his two daughters getting older, he also noted that he found himself having more free time which has allowed him to spend more time learning how to play Egyptian music. “Any time I have now at home, I’m just trying to recreate any of my favorite songs from memory and then I post it on Instagram,” Mohamed said.

 

We then asked both lecturers what career they think they would’ve pursued in an alternate universe where they didn’t take on physics.

Peter answered by telling us that he had first come to MIT wanting to be a film major because of a film documentary program on campus, but, for a time, he had considered transferring to the California Institute of the Arts. He then told us a story about when he visited the school and met a film specialist (who turned out to be the creator of Star Wars) but then added that he was happy having stuck with physics because he felt he might’ve burnt out working in film.”So my alternative life might’ve been in film, but I’m happy that I didn’t do that,” Peter said. 

 

Mohamed then told us he either would’ve been a web developer or a musician and shared a story about his experience in writing songs for the scouting team at his University in Egypt where people would sing the songs he wrote. “I’m actually recovering my songs that I created and now I can play them. It’s magnificent for me,” Mohamed added. 

 

To finish off the interview we then asked both lecturers what they were most looking forward to when looking ahead.

Peter started by stating a number of upcoming experiences that include his daughter having her second child in September, spending more time exploring music, sports, and painting, volunteering for indigenous groups, travelling, spending time with his wife, and living. He then added that he would especially miss working with Mohamed for the past six years where he had the opportunity to learn from him. “There’s this very subtle process about ending your career, because sometimes people look through you and every transition in life always has its surprises and its difficulties and its positive things. So I’m kind of looking forward to embracing that transition,” Peter said. 

 

Mohamed then replied by saying he was grateful to have been able to work with Peter during his time here. “Peter has been my godfather really since I came here. And I’ve really enjoyed and will continue to enjoy our relationship, of course,” he said. Mohamed then discussed his excitement for continuing research at his alma mater, the University of Chicago. “I know that department, I know the students, I know the courses, but I was a grad student then. So it’s kind of exciting now to come back and be the actual professor teaching the course,” he added.

 

Following this, Peter began telling us about his first encounter with Mohamed. At MIT and many other institutions, individuals planning to work as a postdoc must give a lecture discussing the concepts they know. When Mohamed had given his lecture, Peter had been invited to sit in the audience and was astounded by the breadth of information that Mohamed had been able to demonstrate. “I was just there thinking: ‘This guy really knows what he’s talking about.’ And he’s designed his own pedagogy and model for teaching. I had the feeling too that Mohamed’s model came from actually working with students,” Peter said. 

 

Mohamed responded by thanking Peter stating that, “Peter was very generous with me. He immediately invited me to be his grad TA in the classroom. That’s not typical for a postdoc,” said Mohamed. Mohamed then went on to add that he had learned so much about teaching introductory physics content from working with Peter. “He just invited me to work with him in the classroom. And I learned 8.01 from him,” Mohamed said.

“See that’s a great thing: teaching is about learning. And that’s the thing about MIT. I realized that you can always be a learner here, always,” Peter said.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9473-3.jpg

king of boston -> king of the world?,Angie F. '28,9,2025-05-29T00:00:00-04:00,"i. the sleeping hummingbird

Here’s something you should know about me: everyone at MIT calls me the King of Boston. And by “everyone” I of course mean myself and about ten other people I have somehow coerced into deriving amusement from my ridiculous, self-indulgent bit. It all started when I was here over the summer for 
        Interphase
      
, truly away from home for the first time and overwhelmed by the feeling of having an entire city stretch out before me after a lifetime of short beachside buildings and suburban sprawl. Everyone else there either knew as much as I did or more, with the exception being my friends from out of town who came to visit a couple of weeks in. As shaky and new as it was, my status as a local cemented me as their weekend trip’s official tour guide. I took us up through the Infinite and down into the tunnels, running across the bridge and sailing around in swan boats, wandering through the Boston Public Library and diving into the MFA. However, my Google Maps abilities only took me so far, and I often found myself repeating streets, hopelessly misinterpreting T routes (at one point, our group of three ended up on two separate 
        Green Line trains
      
, neither of which was going towards our intended destination), and spinning around as I desperately tried to align myself with the patient app’s arrow.

“Angie,” my friends would ask me, “are you sure you know where you’re going?”

“Of course I do,” I’d shrug as I brought my phone closer and closer to my face. “I’m the King of Boston.”

Somehow, even after the trip ended, the nickname stuck with me…



…and, eventually, others.



I even dressed as the King of Boston for Halloween, a completely nonsensical costume I had to explain to quite literally every person who passed me by.

oh brother

To this day, I’m not sure why I’ve become so enamored with this little identity I’ve created for myself. I guess it’s because it’s just that: an identity I’ve created for myself. When I first got into MIT, I barely slept for four straight nights, the pure excitement coursing through my veins keeping my eyes plastered open for hours on end. When I got here for the summer, I found myself spending copious amounts of time staring up at my ceiling in the dark once again, overwhelmed by the feeling that, here, I could finally be wherever, whatever, and whoever I wanted to be. When the semester kicked off, those sleepless nights persisted, but some of the excitement gave way to something else, a restlessness I couldn’t really name. I’d fall asleep and find it still there when I woke up, following me through morning classes and afternoon dining hall visits and, finally, nights spent on Killian Court staring at the dome. Lit up from within in blinding, brilliant white, it towered over me in a way that seemed to say “ok, you can be whatever you want. So, what’s it going to be?”

I applied to MIT dead set on 
        course 6-4
      
, on making my way to the forefront of AI development and steering it to responsible yet world-altering growth. Over the summer, I fell in love with the idea of building something I could see and feel and turned to engineering: 
        course 2
      
 to be more specific. Once the semester kicked off, though, I found myself writing literature reviews on human-robot interaction in space for my 
        UROP
      
, finding beauty in the synchronicity and the mystery of molecular biology through 
        7.012
      
, and yearning for a return to my high school programming days as one of my best friends walked me through his 
        6.1210
      
 pset during one of our many late night study sessions. 

In high school, the goals I could choose for myself were fairly limited: it was very easy to choose a few and zero in on them, mapping out a clear course of action I could attack with laser focus. Now, though, the world was opening up before me, and it was more beautiful than it was terrifying, by a lot. But, on some days, that gap between awe and fear closed, and I’d feel like I was already losing a race I’d just started. Once again, I had nights I’d spend wide awake, only this time gripped by the vision of myself five, ten years from now looking back on the time I spent in this place full of opportunities and knowing that I failed to grasp the right one. 

The September wind blowing through Beacon Street carries this fear out of me for the first time. “Maybe it’s immature, but all I know is that I want to do something great. I just have no clue how,” I tell a friend as we make our way through the night. For some reason, something within me braces itself for his response, for the dismissal that will surely follow. Nearly everyone I’ve met here so far is driven by a specific set of passions; any mark they want to leave on the world is intertwined with that. Focusing on impact alone feels incomplete, naive. 

But what I hear instead is “King of Boston to king of the world.” All I can do is nod. 

ii. the murdered dead of armies

As the months pass, this conversation stays with me; so do the sleepless nights, my mounting indecision. And I feel myself moving slower, reaching for opportunities with less vigor, burdened by the terrible feeling of being behind. Whatever it is I’ll eventually realize I want to do, others will have wanted to do it for longer, and it’ll be too late for me to catch up and leave any kind of impact. Initially, I’m not consciously aware of this conclusion I’ve reached, but it’s started dragging at my ankles by first semester finals week and pulling me back with all its might by the end of 
        IAP
      
. When I preregister for classes, all I can think about are my friends who took them freshman fall, or tested or petitioned out of them before I even knew they existed. When I quit my UROP, as I finally admit to myself that the work has lost its luster and I likely won’t be an engineer and need to set myself on a path that isn’t robotics, I feel like I’ve let go of a lifeline, like I’ll never have another opportunity like that again. 

I fail at one thing, and then another, and then I register for 
        14.01
      
, because I tell myself that I likely won’t find that path that I long for, where I find work I can absolutely lose myself in and put every beautiful thing I’ve been given by the world (my hands my eyes my ears my single in Maseeh my late nights in 
        Barker
      
 my hallways full of research posters all my brilliant beautiful friends) back into it ten times over, so I might as well ensure I’m successful by at least some metric: that is to say, I might as well make some money. And there are many really important and entertaining problems in econ, anyway, even if it isn’t what I think would satisfy me long term. This, of course, comes with its own set of problems, because even though the path I’d follow as a financebro is clearer to me than the one I’d follow as a course ? focusing on ?, I never once delude myself into thinking it will be easy: some of the smartest people I know have already started working on getting into the field much harder and earlier than I am now, and who am I to think I could measure up to them? The direction gives me some comfort, though, and the kinds of problems I’d be solving at any of the summer internship positions I look at in vain are complex and interesting: for a few weeks, it’s something close to enough, though I know the whole time I’m turning into something I’m not. 

Then, I bomb an interview. My interview skills are mostly fine, though I’m talking at a million miles an hour and drinking way too much water; I like the MBA student interviewing me; and the position sounds genuinely fascinating, largely because I’d have a completely technical role that wouldn’t require any financial knowledge I couldn’t reasonably develop myself in the next few months. But I’m, to put it lightly, technically incompetent, and it embarrasses me so much I briefly consider emailing the interviewer to report that I’d hit my head on the way to the interview and not realized I was concussed until after. I twitch every time I think about it for the rest of the day, and the day after that. Overall I’m pretty chill about it. And I keep applying for jobs (though I retreat from finance with my tail between my legs and aim for more pure CS stuff), and I ramp up my work for Arcturus outreach. 

Arcturus is our autonomous robotics team, and they build an autonomous boat every year for the Roboboat competition. STEM-related community service was a big part of who I was in high school, and I wanted to make sure I kept at it at MIT, where I was in such a unique position to give back. So, early fall semester, I joined Arcturus as the head of their outreach program. Every time I show up to the 
        Seagrant lab
      
, to drag 
        Fish n’ Ships
      
 through Cambridgeport on a little wagon or to teach kids to make their own robot boats and 
        stop them from trying to tear the lab door hinges off with PVC cutters
      
, I catch myself staring at every sign and every piece of machinery, asking the Arcturus team members about what other kind of research goes on in the lab. 

Maybe I just miss home, I tell myself: for most of my life, the beach was never more than thirty seconds away. But I hear myself telling so many of my friends about this one researcher’s work learning from seal whiskers to create better sensors, and a few weeks later, I’m at an electrical engineering and computer science summer UROP fair and nothing intrigues me more than the lab creating machine learning (ML) models for ocean dynamics. And, in spite of me sending the same copy-paste interest email to most everyone who attended, that is the lab that gives me the most enthusiastic response, and the one I end up working with. A few days after my work with them starts, I find myself at an Arcturus outreach event telling the team leads that, depending on how I feel about ML stuff following my UROP, I’ll likely join their autonomy team. I’ve never thought about it before then, but as it comes out of my mouth I realize it feels right. 

On my second 14.01 midterm– which, thanks to flu b keeping me in bed for both midterm #1 and its makeup, is worth almost half my grade, putting me in a spot where I’d have to do incredibly, incredibly well on both remaining exams in order to get a grade I could achieve with a nontrivial amount of goofing off in my other classes– I answer a question I have absolutely zero clue how to approach with a paragraph on seal whisker sensors and a note informing the grader that I will likely be dropping the class, but had fun learning what I did and thought the lectures were enjoyable. After the exam, I do just that, then close my tab full of practice exams, open up Google Collab, and get to work on my UROP.

iii. the sun that eats you as you face it

“Everyone here is here because they’ve been obsessed with something.” It’s first semester again and Emily and I are sitting on my dorm room floor, closing off one of our semiregular late night debriefs. We’ve already gone through her frat and my UROP and her rocket teams– yes, teams. She’s designing the payload for one and serving as head of explosives for the other. When she said this, I couldn’t help but remember the build team events I attended during orientation week and all the work that comes with just being part of one of them, and my eyes widened. But so did hers, and the fire that never leaves them singed every concern in my mind to dust: if there’s anyone out there who can take on this world (and then everything outside of it– she’s a rocket scientist, after all), it’s Emily.

I nod, vigorously. “I think about this all the time. Like, I look at people and I think ‘you’ve wanted something so much you haven’t been able to sleep before’”

She smiles wide. “I love asking people here what their thing is.” I feel a pang of secondhand fear at the thought of being on the receiving end of that question, but nod in agreement as to not break out of the ping pong rhythm of this excited back and forth I find myself falling into with my friends whenever we remember where we are– a place that is somehow both unfathomably bigger than anything we could dream up and more welcoming than any of the smaller ones we passed through on the way here. And also because I really, really do agree. “Do you want to hear a poem about this that Jack showed me yesterday?” I ask. “Maybe he’s already recited it for you.” Our classmate Jack loves poetry– and physics and philosophy and riding motorcycles and biotechnology and country music and about a million other things. My dad calls him a Renaissance man, but Emily and I get to call him one of our best friends, and this means we hear a lot of poems.

carlos + me + jack

“He hasn’t, read it to me! But keep it under a minute. I have to go to bed.”

I don’t need to read it. I just pause to bring it back to my mind, which only takes a second: after all, it’s been lingering in my head since I first heard it, through dark, wind-slapped walks to and from the library with my hands shoved into my pockets and the groggy mornings after I spend dragging myself out of bed. Once I start, I stutter once or twice– but never stop.

At this point, a smile starts to spread across my face: I’ve read the poem well over a dozen times and never made it through without one.

Throughout the poem, Emily’s face has stayed still, her eyes appearing to be trained on the ground but clearly focused on something far, far beyond it. For a second, I worry that she didn’t like it, but then she pulls her phone out and opens her Notes app. “What’s it called? That made me think about my rockets. I want to memorize it too.” 

My smile widens. “‘Roll the Dice’ by Charles Bukowski.” We exchange plans for the morning– she’s going to hit the gym and then work on her rockets, I’m going to read for 
        3.091
      
— and with a hug, she leaves me with my desk and my books and my laptop and, of course, my poem. All of a sudden, my morning reading seems very doable tonight. I walk out to grab some 
        late night
      
, passing by the floor lounge and seeing Emily, who’d stopped to talk to some friends on the way back to her room. We all wave at each other as I slip past, Emily’s voice ringing behind me. “You don’t understand how excited I am about my rockets, Izaan.”

I feel my smile creep back in, and with it comes a strange sense of certainty I don’t normally feel. All of a sudden, I’m back to a night a few weeks ago that ended in me walking down Amherst Street with Jack, my vision fixing itself to the orange statues peeking out the glowing windows of the Media Lab as I let the autumn night’s wind do its job.

“Every moment here feels like a dream. Both in the–” I stumble over my words for a bit. “I’m so tired. Both in the way you’d think and also like– you know when you’re just waking up and you’re thinking about the dream you just had, and you’re already kind of forgetting it? I’ll do things and it feels like I’m already awake, remembering them.” Pause. “I need to figure out how to word that better.”

“I understand what you mean.”

“I keep thinking about how this is the most important place I’ll ever be.”


“No, it’s not.” Ping pong ball drops. Or maybe it was never there to begin with. “You’re here for a reason. This place is transitive and transitory: transitory because you’re going to leave, whether you like it or not, and transitive because it’s taking you somewhere.”

Writing this all down over half a year later, I no longer know what I said after that. Even as I said it back then, I don’t think I knew.

iv. you know and i know and thee know

I know that, one day, I’ll find something I love as much as Emily loves her rockets. And I know that, for now, I get to spend my days writing code that helps us understand our oceans a little bit better every time I run it, and I’m happy about it. Maybe this is that something, or maybe I’ll go back to mechanical engineering, or biology, or space exploration. Or maybe even finance… though I doubt it. But every day, I meet more brilliant people who were once just like me: undergrads who only knew they wanted to maximize their impact on the world, with no clue how or if they’d do it. And, though I still have my fair share of restless nights, I feel a little more at peace every time our paths cross. 

Part of harbor seals’ remarkable ability to use their whiskers to sense their surroundings comes from their ability to keep them still relative to their movements: it’s hypothesized that their undulatory and asymmetric shape helps them reduce the amount that they vibrate in response to forces that affect other natural and manmade sensors. Whether their bodies are twisting lazily along with the current or writhing wildly through the water as they chase after a fish, in the seal’s frame of reference, their whiskers are almost completely still. And maybe that’s all that matters. Keeping certain parts of myself still no matter how much the rest of me moves. If I stop doing STEM outreach, or writing for this blog, or letting my friends in for late night floor talks, even if it means I have more time to lock in and do twelve classes and three UROPs and lock in, I’ll be bastardizing parts of myself I need to guide the rest of me forward. Maybe I just have to focus on keeping them intact, and on staying in motion, and everything else will fall into place. 

v. we will defeat death

It’s freshman fall again, and Jack and I are staring out at the skyline. The most important place in the world.



“I don’t know,” I sigh, on the tail end of a ramble about my most recent misadventure, a few moments of hubris-induced hope followed by a considerable blow to my ego. “I guess I just wanted to be king for a day.”

“You’re king for more than a day,” he tells me. And I believe him. And for a moment I’m so aware of this dream, lying awake in my bed as the sunrise warms the brick walls of Maseeh, and each cell in my body feels razor-sharply focused, still sensing the world I just crawled out of and managing to stay perfectly still in order to take it all in. I’ve been here for almost a year, and all I want is still to be able to take it all in.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1068-1-400x711.jpg

Eating my words at Area Four,Andi Q. '25,3,2025-05-29T00:00:00-04:00,"Area Four (A4) is a popular pizzeria/cafe near MIT. Known for their wood-fired pizza made from a 10-year-old sourdough starter, A4 is the go-to pizza spot for many MIT students.

But not me.

I am A4’s biggest hater, as I believe their pizza defies all known laws of reality. For one, the crust is always simultaneously burnt yet still undercooked. But more perplexingly, the tip of the slice always flops down and 
        spills toppings, cheese, and sauce all over your lap
      
 even when you fold it in half.

To appreciate just how cursed this floppiness is, we must first understand some differential geometry. In differential geometry, “Gaussian curvature” is a quantity that describes how a surface curves in 3D space at a given point on the surface. Each direction has some curvature that can be positive (like a frowny face), negative (like a smiley face), or zero (like a straight line); the Gaussian curvature is then defined by multiplying the maximum and minimum curvatures along some directions. The diagram below shows what Gaussian curvature looks like visually:

A nice diagram I took from science4all.org

Gaussian curvature has many nice properties, but in particular:

- If you bend a surface without stretching or crumpling it, its Gaussian curvature doesn’t change.

- Flat surfaces have zero Gaussian curvature everywhere.

These two properties mean that if you take a flat surface and bend it in one direction, the other direction will become flat and rigid to preserve the zero Gaussian curvature. Indeed, watch how a strip of paper perks up with just the slightest amount of folding at the end:

 

Since a pizza slice is a flat surface before you pick it up, we should expect the same thing to happen to it. That’s why it’s mathematically a good idea to fold large slices of pizza to prevent drooping; TED-Ed even made a video about it 12 years ago!

Yet despite this fundamental result of differential geometry, this happens every time:

:(

In a cruel twist of fate, the graduating blogger dinner on Tuesday (featuring Petey and Ceri) was held at A4. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza pictured above, while Jebby, Fatima, and Mel all ordered the “mushroom and fontina” pizza. Mel must have felt sorry for me though (after witnessing the sad drooping of my slice) and offered to trade a slice of the mushroom pizza with me.

The difference between the Hawaiian pizza and the mushroom pizza was night and day. It was not burnt or undercooked. It did not flop when I picked it up. It was… genuinely delicious! Possibly one of the best slices of pizza I’ve eaten while at MIT. Unlike other A4 pizzas I’ve eaten, the mushroom pizza didn’t use any tomato sauce, which probably gave it the structural integrity the other pizzas lacked.

During the dinner, Petey also mentioned (in response to my initial distaste for A4) that former U.S. President Barack Obama chose to dine at A4 when he visited Cambridge in 2015. And of course, Obama also ordered the mushroom and fontina pizza!

I’m still A4’s biggest hater because of all the past pizza sins I’ve suffered there, but I suppose I can no longer say that all of their pizza is bad. Just remind me to order the mushroom and fontina pizza the next time I visit MIT and Petey/Ceri drag me to A4.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gaussian_curvature-800x222.png

the threek post!,Angie F. '28,5,2025-05-27T00:00:00-04:00,"I shouldn’t have ranked Maseeh first. That’s the thought that kept creeping around the back of my mind during all of 
        REX
      
, as I ran around events at what seemed to be every dorm but the one I was slated to live in for the next year. I’d been warned about this: at Campus Preview Weekend (MIT’s admitted students weekend, also known as CPW) , many upperclassmen told me that, while Maseeh didn’t have the culture other dorms had, its proximity to campus and quick access to a dining hall made up for it. As long as I had individual friends in Maseeh, I’d figured, dorm culture wasn’t too important, and I ranked it first on my housing intent form when it came out in May. However, after getting to campus and dancing, having my face painted, getting covered in whipped cream and feathers, and yelling at a table at Burton Conner, I decided that that was the dorm for me– at least until East Campus, who was responsible for building the giant fort I spent a fair amount of the rest of REX at, reopened. I filled out my 
        FYRE
      
 form and was unsurprisingly turned away: lots of people had had my same idea, and only one student ended up FYREing into Burton Conner. I shrugged it off pretty quickly and started filling my time with EC events, deciding that Maseeh (floor three, or M3, to be more specific) was as good a place as any to start and end my days at, even if the hours in between were spent, well, anywhere else. I could have spent my whole year like this; one fateful night, however, I walked by the floor three lounge and met…

THE THREEKS!

the M3ers, or threeks, at freshman formal!

“now to describe who threeks are. individually, we are interested in a variety of things–we have athletes, dancers, musicians and more. what we have in common is a love for side quests (aka doing dumb things for wondercoin), an unmatched sense of humor, and just threekiness (it’s hard to put into words).” – Janhavi

– Janhavi

Unlike other dorms, who have established cultures that likeminded freshmen found their way to during CPW and Rex, Maseeh attracted an extremely wide variety of people who were then randomly assigned to floors, most of whom I probably would have never met otherwise. As some of my fellow M3 residents put it…

“M3 is a place I never knew I needed until I found it and now there’s no going back. M3 has such a diverse group of people not only from different parts of the world but different mindsets and interests that create an unexpected but splendid community. Unlike other living groups that already have some sort of culture (Bombers, B1ers) we had to start from ground 0 and create our own culture.” – Lisa

“I don’t even live on M3! It was a twist of fate that I met Zaee, Peter (M3 residents), and our Simmons friend Jerry on the subway to the aquarium trip. I kind of got adopted in and am now pretty ingrained in the M3 family. So to any prefrosh who need this: go do things, even if you don’t feel like it/are scared/yada yada. I personally did not have a great time during REX, and was on the verge of not going to the aquarium either. But I went, and BAM! Single most instant connection I’ve ever had with a group of people, who I feel safe, accepted, and loved by. This extends to all of M3! We’re all a little different. We look like a group of randos from the entire assortment of high school cliques. But we mesh like oobleck, and I think we all kinda love that we’re all weird as shit in our own ways.” – Nicole (a.k.a Nic G a.k.a Nicool)

Aside from two floormates I knew before freshman year started, the threeks are largely unlike many of the friends I’ve met through classes, clubs, EC shenanigans, etc. And yet, somehow, when I get back from a day of locking in or balling out or both, it’s not my room but the lounge I feel like I’m coming home to. They’ve turned Maseeh 3 into a place that is both welcoming to everyone and easily distinguishable from any other floor in the building, and given me an incredibly different experience from the cultureless but convenient place to call home I was promised during CPW. What does that experience entail, you may ask? Here’s some of what we like to do…

THRIP! THREEKTREAT!

“If you told me when I came to MIT that I would be going on a retreat with some randos that live down my hall, I would wouldn’t even know what to say because that’s a highly specific scenario but nonetheless it was the best thing I’ve done at MIT so far (in terms of nonacademic work of course). I’ve learned so much from this group of people and have had too much fun with them.” – Lisa

I unfortunately was unable to attend threek retreat due to a series of scheduling mishaps on my end :( but I’m still putting it first on the list because it is one of my favorites of our new M3 traditions, planned largely by our friend Aleks (a.k.a Garbuz). The Threeks all went to Maine for a weekend and had a grand ol’ time. 

“During retreat some stories I can think of is when we dressed up for a dinner we cooked ourselves to make it seem more fancy, or when we played hot seat for the millionth time, or when we walked to the beach at night, or when we saw snow on the beach in the morning and a guy was cross country skiing there. Or when we had the huge snowball fight!” – Lisa (again) (my goat)

Wondercoin

It was 4 in the morning in a New Vassar study room when my best friend Carlos told me that he had an idea. 

It boiled down to this: we already did embarrassing stuff all the time. What if we could get paid for it? Furthermore, what if we could pay our friends to embarrass themselves for us? And so, Wondercoin was born. With a conversion rate of roughly 50 Wondercoin per Dunkin’ Donuts Meal Deal (inflation hit us hard when the price went from five to six dollars), every friend of ours who chose to be part of our system could propose and accept challenges to and from other friends in exchange for our currency, which they could cash out for real money at any time (though I don’t think anyone ever has). Here are some things this has led to…

- My acapella audition: I’ll let my texts with threeks Carlos (rodman) and Keegan (keegman wonder) speak for themselves:

I had originally planned on going to auditions for Resos, our fellow threek Ali’s a capella group. However, while looking for their audition room, I lingered in front of another group’s table for a bit too long and was asked if I was interested in trying out. I shrugged and nodded: I didn’t know much about a capella, but all the groups were more or less the same at the end of the day, right? A few minutes later, I would read the sign on the table I was in front of and discover that I was horribly wrong. I’d signed up to audition for the Syncopasians, MIT’s East Asian a capella group. They perform original arrangements in not only English but also Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, and other East Asian languages. Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe that they’re the only group on campus that does this, which is pretty awesome! The only problem with this is that I am not East Asian, nor do I know any East Asian languages or consider myself well-versed in any East Asian culture. Uh Oh. Regardless, I remained steadfast and shuffled into the audition room with my head held high. I stuttered my way through some vocal warmups before getting to the main event: my rendition of “Fireflies” by Owl City. However, I could not bring myself to perform such a meaningful song without first explaining why it was so important to me and my journey as a vocalist. Here’s a transcript of my introduction to my performance:

“So my song is ‘Fireflies’ by Owl City, and this is a song that’s very important to me. Growing up, it was mostly me and my older brother, Keegan. He really likes this song, um… sorry, I’m, like, a little… a little nervous… but yeah, uh, he really likes this song, he’d play it for me a lot. And then when I was 12, I found out I’d had a twin named Carlos who I’d eaten in utero, which is like funny now but when I was 12 I was like, sad about it. And then my brother really helped me and comforted me through that, and he played this song for me after”

“So my song is ‘Fireflies’ by Owl City, and this is a song that’s very important to me. Growing up, it was mostly me and my older brother, Keegan.

And then my brother really helped me and comforted me through that, and he played this song for me after”

Then, it was time to sing:

After ten excruciating minutes, I was set free and rewarded with a slice of cheesesteak pizza. Eating my prize on the building two benches, I felt incredibly light, like I’d broken through some invisible barrier of self-consciousness and could now unashamedly embarrass myself in any way I pleased. I walked home feeling wholly in charge of my life. Later that weekend, I discovered I’d been rejected from the Syncopasians; a few days later, Carlos revealed the truth behind my audition to a friend in the group, who asked him if the bad singing was part of the bit. I’ve come to terms with the fact that, like most great artists, my craft may never be appreciated in my time.

“It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.”

- The 6.1200 performance: I don’t know why I keep ending up singing. I also didn’t get any Wondercoin for this. One fateful day, I ran into Christine (non-threek) and Anooshka outside of Maseeh, and they told me that (with our professor’s permission) they were going to sing a song about graph theory (to the tune of “Fireflies,” in honor of my recent audition) during our 
        6.1200
      
 lecture and that I was going to do it with them. I said yes before I really thought about it, as I tend to do. We put on quite a show if I do say so myself:

- The tour incident: This was a big one. Lisa and Anooshka goofed off in front of numerous campus tour groups while Izaan stood nearby in a hot dog costume and other threeks hid and watched. One of them involved them arguing over Anooshka’s imaginary “situationship of three months,” another involved them loudly pretending to eat the hot dog costume while Izaan tried to convince them it was a costume.

All of them ended with the three of them promoting our floor’s CPW event…

…The M3 Hot Dog Eating Contest!

We held a hot dog eating contest during CPW to meet incoming freshmen (a.k.a prefrosh) and give them a taste of life on floor. MIT Admissions’ very own Petey ended up winning by a landslide, eating three hot dogs in about three seconds and leaving the crowd in shock.

T-Shirt Exchange

During our first semester, Carlos planned a t-shirt exchange, in which everyone was randomly assigned a threek and had to buy a shirt for them. This was when I was still beginning to get more involved in floor activities, so I didn’t participate in it, but seeing how much fun everyone had with it definitely pushed me to try and become closer friends with everyone on hall! As for the shirts themselves, well… let’s just say that they are top threeekret.

Anooshka’s Flag Changing Ceremony

One day in January, mysterious posters began to appear around M3…

hmmmm

Anooshka had decided that she was going to start every semester by ceremonially changing the flag above her bed, and she had invited us all to join. The ceremony featured a dance performance by her and her roommate Emily, live music, a speech, and all our threeks in their fanciest garb.

Concerts

“you should write about the rex orange county concert!! a bunch of us went and it was a blast. we went to insomnia cookies after and stayed up till 5am talking.” – Renuka

Additionally, many of our threeks are talented musicians and dancers, taking part in 
        Mirchi
      
, MIT Symphonic Orchestra, Latin Dance Club, 
        Ohms
      
, and 
        others!
      
 M3ers typically roll out en masse whenever a floormate has a show, and it’s always really awesome to see everyone coming together to support a friend. 

threeks at MITSO!

and more!

“one of my favorite m3 memories is stargazing late on the night of halloween. at like 2am we all went out to killian with blankets and hoodies and just talked and hung out and frolicked and raced each other on the grass. at this point we didn’t know each other as well as we do now, but this was like a core bonding moment for us. most of my other favorite m3 memories involve staying up till sunrise just talking about important and completely unimportant things, watching dumb movies, doing blind karaoke, giving each other rides down the hall in Carlos’s laundry cart, and TRADER JOES STUDY BREAKS (lots of love for Raechel, Chyna, and Seth). “ – Janhavi

“M3 is genuinely one of the best things that has happened to me!! since we didn’t really form like a normal friend group it’s really interesting to see how different we all are at time, but genuinely such a family at the end of the day and we all get along so well. words cannot describe the love i have for threeks. i went through a lot of emotional stress during the first few months of freshman year, dealing with bad imposter syndrome and the end of a 2 year long relationship. the only way i grew out of that challenge was with the help of threeks. i got so much love and support and the genuineness shines out of these people. i love our late night talks and daily crash outs and i’m so glad i am part of such an amazing friend group. my favorite people of all time tbh” – Renuka

My friendship with the threeks was arguably one of my most unexpected ones, and, even though I’ll be moving to East Campus (which prefrosh should also check out– here’s a very EC-centric blog post I wrote and our section in the MIT Guide to Residences. Definitely watch the video :p) in the fall, I’m planning on maintaining it for the rest of my time at MIT. In fact, lots of the things that drew me to East Campus during those first few months of freshman year are the things I ended up loving about M3. An abundance of people with silly ideas and the will to commit to them; how welcoming and supportive everyone is; creativity that manifests itself not only in the artistic pursuits of many people on floor but also in the way everyone approaches life, constantly looking for opportunities to sidequest and ways to make every day fun. Despite being incredibly brilliant and talented, everyone on floor is very humble and always tries their best to lift others and their achievements up. I’m so grateful to have had the chance to connect with and learn from the threeks this year, and though I ended up finding community in East Campus, M3 will always have a special place in my heart as my first home at MIT. To any prefrosh reading this: advice from upperclassmen is generally extremely useful, but consider taking a second glance at some of the places they overlook and deciding for yourself what to make of them. You never know what you’ll find :) Threek out!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3087-6-400x300.jpg

[Joint Post] DesignPlus,Ellie F. '28,2,2025-05-26T00:00:00-04:00,"You can now read this blog on the Morningside Academy of Design (MAD) website here: Designing a First Year at MIT

First year MIT students are given the choice of several types of faculty advising. There’s traditional advising, a non-credit option in which advisees simply meet with their advisor several times a semester; advising seminars (for credit), which combine weekly exploratory classes with normal advising; and learning communities, which are more specialized, community-based advising “teams.” There are currently four options for learning communities: Terrascope, Concourse, Experimental Study Group, and DesignPlus.

We’re here today to talk about DesignPlus, or D+ for short! As the name suggests, it’s oriented around design, and is overseen primarily by the Morningside Academy for Design (MAD). Through mentors/advisors, workshops, speaker talks, and community events, students learn about all types of design and related fields and bond with fellow classmates. There’s also an emphasis on making and designing actual things, and students gain various maker skills and guidance in personal projects. We (Ellie, Teresa, and Gloria) are or were all part of DesignPlus, and it’s had a big impact on our MIT experiences so far, in different ways!

ellie:

Making things, feeling objects assemble in my hands, seeing beautiful lines flow from my pencil, is so insanely addicting. I never built anything technical in high school, but in my senior year, I dove into an endless whirlwind of crafting, learning crochet and origami, and constantly sketching in all my classes. Still, when it came time to rank my choices for first-year advising, I kept hesitating. What if I wasn’t good enough for DesignPlus?

I ranked DesignPlus first anyway, and, despite lingering fears of not having enough skills or knowledge to fit in, I was completely thrilled to join the community. In the very first meeting, I was already sipping away at the free bobas and helping fold origami modules. I soon got a shop orientation, and Bill, one of the shop managers, trained me on various tools and machines, including both laser cutters, the 3D printers, a CAD software, and the sticker printer.

The DesignPlus schedule mostly consists of two things: community-wide lunches, and seminars. We had free, catered lunch every Thursday, with speakers from different fields and companies sharing their incredible stories while we ate. Afterwards, I’d spend a free hour relaxing in the lounge, working on psets and chatting about people’s various projects. Seminars, on the other hand, differ from person to person. Each seminar had about 10 to 20 people, and they each worked on different projects. I was in the fine metalworking seminar with Rhea, where we’d spend an hour and a half every Tuesday learning to saw, anneal, solder, and polish sheets of metal to turn them into beautiful rings.

Later on in the semester, I started working on more projects in the DesignPlus space. Bill trained me on the CNC embroidery machine, and I used it to embroider a design onto a shirt I had thrifted. Afterwards, I started working on a gift, which was a project we were encouraged to design and create over the course of the semester. I drew out patterns for a big chicken plushie, derived from a few I found online. I’d spend whatever chunks of free time I had in the DesignPlus lounge, cutting out paper mockups and iterating over my designs. When I was done designing, I migrated to the fabric arts room, where I used the free fabric and pins and needles and thread to finish my project. 

 

DesignPlus encapsulates one of my favorite things about MIT: its spirit of creativity and creation. I am surrounded by people who love making and trying new things. Instead of being scared to ask for help, I feel encouraged to do so. I am provided the skills and resources I need to turn my designs into reality. Through DesignPlus, I have become so much more confident in my identity as a designer, builder, and maker.

gloria:

I was in DesignPlus in my first year! It was the fall of 2022, the second iteration of the program. Admittedly, I didn’t go to a lot of the events that year because I had a class conflict with the weekly seminar time; outside of designated event times, though, I spent a lot of my own time just hanging out or working in the D+ lounge space. I absolutely love that lounge space—besides having one of the most comfy couches on campus (many a nap has been taken there), it’s also just a great community space, filled with other members’ projects, materials, and scraps. It’s a sort of organized chaos, really encouraging experimentation and play, and I love chatting with other people there about their ongoing projects, ideas, and general design-related thoughts. I also appreciate that it’s available as project storage space for D+ members; it’s so convenient not having to lug around bags of materials and partly assembled contraptions.

Being part of DesignPlus also gets you tap access to the MAD fabrication shop overall (on the 3rd floor of building N52), which includes a whole range of machines, from metal laser cutters to sewing machines to CNC routers. Bill and Chris, the shop managers, are so helpful and always willing to show you how to use a machine, and they also put in the underappreciated work of making sure everything is functional and safe for shop users. This semester, I started working as a shop monitor, and it’s been fun to guide people around the shop and answer their questions.

I can’t overstate just how important this space has been to me in my three years on-campus so far. On one hand, it’s a really great place to work on personal projects, with all the machines/tools available and storage space. On the other hand, and more importantly, it’s kind of like a hub for a lot of architecture and design-affiliated people on-campus. I feel like every time I go to the MAD shop/ Design+ lounge, I run into someone that I know, see a cool project in-progress, or learn a new skill, and I’ve come to treat the shop as a third space or second home on-campus. In my opinion, the most valuable aspect of DesignPlus for me has been how it’s introduced me to the broader architecture/design community at MIT, in no small part due to the lounge and MAD shop access :). 

teresa:

I was also in DesignPlus my first year! To be completely honest, when I was filling out my choices for advisors/seminars, I didn’t really know the distinction between a learning community and traditional advisors. I didn’t take as much time as I probably should have mulling over all of the descriptions for the various seminars, so I kind of ended up choosing DesignPlus on a whim. However, I can say that was one of the best decisions I made as an incoming first year student!

DesignPlus is where I first met Gloria, as well as many of my other maker friends. It’s also how I got to know my first year advisor, Paul, as well as many of the other staple inhabitants of the MAD space, like Bill, Chris, John, etc. 

Here are some random photos from my camera roll taken in or around the DesignPlus space—I’ve stayed in touch with the community even after my first year!

And here are some photos that I found beautiful.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-ring-1.jpg

How to build a Tamagotchi,Emiko P. '25,4,2025-05-25T00:00:00-04:00,"This semester I built a Tamagotchi: a 2000s toy where the user takes care of a virtual pet! My Tamagotchi, fondly named Tamako, was like the fetus version of a full-fledged Tamagotchi—it was capable of walking, jumping, and looking oh-so-adorable.

this is what the original Tamagotchi toy looks like

As a mechanical engineering major, I had never worked close enough with electronics to the point of designing them, and that had been something I’d really been wanting to remedy. Specifically, I wanted to learn how to design a circuit board.

And that’s where 2.679: Electromechanical Systems II comes in! I took this class for one main reason: the final project was a completely opened ended opportunity to design your own printed circuit board (PCB)! Once I heard that the class would be funding the project and had full access to an amazing course staff, including 
        Steve Banzaert,
      
, I was fully on board.

From the very beginning, I wanted to make something cute and fun. My mind kept circling back to retro video games—pixelated cartoons and satisfying, clunky buttons. I eventually landed on the idea of building a Tamagotchi because how fun is that??!

So, without further ado, here are the steps showing how you can build your very own Tamagotchi. (Also check out the end of this blog to see what others in this class created!)

Step 1: Design schematic and prototype

A schematic is a drawing of your electrical components and all of their connections to each other. This is where you decide what features you want your circuit board to have. The components I selected were a TFT LED display (the screen that would show my Tamako pet), three buttons, power switch, 9V battery, and Arduino Nano.

The hardest part of this was figuring out the proper configuration of my LED display to my Arduino Nano. There was very little documentation online about this display (because one of the TAs kindly scrounged around their lab to find a spare one for me), so I had to go through each pin manually and figure out what its function was and how it matched to the Nano.

I made sure to build a quick little prototype that verified this would function how I wanted it to. I had all of these parts already, but usually there would be another step of ordering your parts off of DigiKey, Adafruit, etc.

successful prototype

 

I was then able to translate this prototype to a schematic, which shows all of these components and their connections in a symbolic diagram.

Step 2: Design PCB layout

This is the part where you bring your schematic to life. How will these connections and these components be positioned on your actual board? I had to keep in mind that I wanted this to be a playable, hand-held game: I was going for a clean look that optimized space.

After organizing the PCB on KiCad, I shipped off the design to be manufactured in China. This is what returned to me a week or so later!

my very first printed circuit board! tamako has arrived :)

 

An important lesson I learned during this step was: ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR WORK PROPERLY!!

Side story if you’re interested: I thought I was being careful with this, but right when I was about to submit my PCB for shipping after working on it for three hours in lab one day, I came back from a break to have realized the thing I had saved was the version of the PCB from the day before! *cue freak out* I told my professor, and he said my only hope was to go back to the same computer (which someone else was using at the time), and see if it was magically there. “Until then, the best thing you can do for yourself is to take a walk.” And that’s what I did. I speed-walked around the basement of Pappalardo, along the street of Mass Ave in a rage-induced haze, then returned after I’d finally cooled off and accepted that I was just going to have to redo the work. Turns out, it was actually saved on that original computer (hallelujah). Lowkey anticlimactic story, but at the time I felt like I had literally been blessed. It all worked out in the end, but I learned some important lessons: 1) carefully save your stuff, 2) don’t underestimate the power of a good walk.

It all worked out in the end, but I learned some important lessons: 1) carefully save your stuff, 2) don’t underestimate the power of a good walk.

Step 3: Solder

This is the step where you physically join parts to the board by connecting their two metal surfaces together. I was pretty new to this skill, but it’s honestly a quick learn, especially because it’s obvious when you’ve made a really solid connection between the two joints.

This is what Tamako was looking like after I installed all the parts.

I placed the Nano on the back of the board to optimize space, and the screen isn’t on here yet because I made it removable. It connects to the black header on the far right.

Step 4: Verify PCB works

This step had one good thing and one bad thing. I’ll start with the bad: I had prototyped this board by displaying text, not images. Unfortunately, this means that I didn’t realize until after I received my PCB that I hadn’t made any way to electrically access the chip that could process/ store the images. TLDR: no images on screen unless I wanted to do some dramatic, complicated rewiring.

However, the good news is: THE PCB WORKED THE SAME AS THE PROTOTYPE!! This is actually huge. The amount of things that could have gone wrong are numerous: I could have messed up the connections between the display and the Arduino, the board could have magically decided it didn’t want to work, I could have done a poor soldering job so there were poor electrical contacts, etc.

But, remarkably, it worked first try. That was huge! And once I realized that I could just form images out of text, I was pretty happy. So in the end, I would say this PCB definitely meets my expectations!

Step 5: Develop software

I knew that my minimum viable product (the bare bones criteria I would have to meet in order to consider this project a success) was a device that could have a little pet move around on the screen and jump. So that’s exactly what I did! I made the pet go left, right, and jump. It was perfect :)

arduino code!

Step 6: Enjoy (and iterate!)

And with that, the Tamagotchi is complete! It’s pretty simple right now, but there is always room to code something more complicated, to 3D print a plastic shell, and to keep experimenting with the project. But when all is said and done, I’ve loved collecting practical experience with KiCad and Arduino, and I am so proud of myself for successfully designing a PCB for the first time. Learning is fun! Yay!

I hope you enjoy playing with your very own Tamagotchi :)

Curious what other people in my class made this semester? Let’s take a look.

This is part of the reason why I love MIT.

The final project was completely open-ended—everything people created here was fueled by their own imagination and whimsy. Many of these people had never really worked with electronics before, but they were willing to learn entirely new skills to bring their visions to life. I felt like I was watching my class dream: they wanted to create something, they were unsure if they possessed the skills to do so, and through some magical mixture of curiosity and drive—they did it. The dream came true.

I mean, what a powerful, crazy, utterly insane idea! To make things because we can! To let our imagination run wild and free, to not reel it back into the realm of the easy and manageable, but to chase it off into the distance and see where it takes us! To accept that we may fail in the pursuit of bringing our dream to life. To push ourselves not because of a class requirement, but because we must try. Because it is in our DNA. 

Because this is what drew us to MIT in the first place: unapologetic, relentless curiosity—the secret sauce that makes the impossible possible.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tamagotchi.jpeg

!!!

Hank is a man of many passions: science communicating across generations, launching companies that donate all their profits to charity, posting thoughtful weekly vlogs — the list goes on. I’ve been a fan of Hank (and his brother John) for basically my entire conscious life. I stumbled into the Green brothers’ corner of the internet about a decade ago and have been captivated ever since.

- CrashCourse and SciShow taught me about how powerful education is and how it can be used for good. They nurtured my love for learning in and of itself. Plus, those resources got me through some tough classes.

- Nerdfighteria gave me a sense of home through connection with a bunch of nerds. It was my first online community.

- As members of the Awesome Socks Club, my friends and I fight every month over who gets the socks. They’re designed by independent artists, delivered through the Good Store, and 100% of the proceeds go to charity.

- The Foundation to Decrease World Suck inspires me with its thoughtful, effective philanthropic efforts.

- An Absolutely Remarkable Thing captured how weird and profound the social internet is. I binge-read that novel.

- The We’re Here newsletter delivers a dose of optimism each week in a mediascape that often thrives on negative news.

- Dear Hank & John and Hank’s TikToks taught me to think more critically and broadened my perspective on the world.

- I look forward to watching Vlogbrothers videos every Tuesday and Friday. They have immensely shaped my worldview through humor, care, and wonder. On a personal note, these videos have helped me maintain hope during especially tough days and reminded me how beautiful it is to be human.

Amidst all his projects, Hank leads with heart. He pulls back the curtain and discusses openly: not just about the polished successes, but the failures too, because those are part of the process. He seeks out truth and, when he finds it, he eagerly shares it. He cares deeply about the world and takes action to help make it better. It’s weird to feel so connected to someone I don’t personally know, but my respect for him is very real. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he were an alum — he’s such a perfect embodiment of MIT culture: nerdy, daring, and curious. I can’t think of a better speaker.



You never truly know the impact you have on others, and this blog only scratches the surface. It feels especially fitting to write about this here, on the MIT Admissions Blogs: a wholesome, geeky corner of the internet similar to Nerdfighteria itself. What follows is a conversation: an interview with Hank, and reflections from the MIT community. 

We’re excited to welcome him with open arms when he gets to campus!

Interview with Hank

We had some questions for Hank, and he had answers.

What is your favorite topic of science or favorite science fun fact?

You know how people often have a song that they’re obsessing over at any given time? That’s how I am with facts. I always have a favorite fact, but it’s also always changing. Right now, it’s a race between the fact that it’s seeming increasingly likely that three of Jupiter’s moons have more liquid water than Earth, and that grasshoppers existed on earth before grasses evolved.

What drew you to science communication and what were you doing before you started Crash Course? 

These two questions are actually so different I’m just going to answer the first half! I am a huge fan of things. Like, I tend to consume content in a way that is really intensive and really curious. The result of that is that I have a really hard time not wanting to try to make things that are like the things I love. That goes for youtube videos, podcasts, comedy,  music, but it goes especially for science communication. I have been subscribed to Scientific American for over 30 years and I’m 44 years old. I love Carl Sagan and Mr Wizard and Beakman and it was very hard for me to watch those guys and not want to be them. 
The fact that I actually kinda ended up having this job is really, really cool, and really, really weird.

Any tips for creators just starting out?

My advice is always some contradictory combination of “know what you actually want” and “iterate constantly.” The only thing I’ve ever seen that reliably leads to creative success on the algorithmic internet is an unhealthy obsession with success on the algorithmic internet, but I’m not going to offer that as advice.

If you weren’t doing what you’re doing today, what else would be doing?

Before YouTube I was writing for a bunch of publications (including my own blog), mostly about green technologies. A lot of my colleagues from that era are still doing that, and I hopefully would have figured out a way to make that work.

Do you have any side hobbies nobody knows about?

I do enjoy a yo yo, but I am not good. Another one is Sid Meier’s Civilization games. 
What would you do if you magically had a 10-day break free of obligations? Probably invent a bunch of new obligations but HOPEFULLY I would just read books and write.

I mean, pretty much what you see. My biggest passions are for raising money for Partners in Health and trying to help people know more about their world.

Do you have any certain beliefs you live by (mottos, values, etc)?

Yeah, absolutely. My wife and I always say (sometimes after a long sigh) “Everybody’s themselves.” It’s just an important reminder that people are different from each other. My big overarching belief is that the whole situation we’ve got going on here on Earth is WAY more interesting and important  than the average person thinks it is, and that goes double for the human parts. People argue with me about that last point, but the way I see it humans are the weirdest, most interesting thing that has ever happened in the known universe. 

Yeah, absolutely. My wife and I always say (sometimes after a long sigh) “Everybody’s themselves.” It’s just an important reminder that people are different from each other.

What are you excited for for the future (can be personally, for society as a whole, etc)?

I probably won’t get to see it, but I think someday we’ll have pretty much cured all illnesses caused by viruses, and I think that would be a very, very cool world to live in.

“He may have made the single largest impact on my worldview among any individual I don’t know personally. He gave me so much academically, provided a guiding hand concerning many of the stranger aspects of the world (offline and online) that I was thrust into as a teenager, and modeled that learning more is always better than asserting that you’re right (even if it’s hard sometimes).”

“I will mostly talk about the more personal/emotional aspects of how their work has impacted me but of course I cannot neglect acknowledging how much *pure, cold, hard, fact-rich information* I have gained from Hank’s (at times dangerously) captivating videos about science. I have heard from so many people outside of STEM fields how much they have learned from Hank’s TikToks and from fellow MIT students about how much they learned from SciShow and CrashCourse growing up. What I am referring to in the paragraphs below goes beyond that. I’ve been a Nerdfighter since 2012, so this is the first online community I have been a part of. The work that Hank and his brother John have been doing throughout the years is like one of these thick weight-bearing pillars of my personality. I honestly don’t think there are other people (besides my immediate family) that have shaped my worldview as much as Hank and John have. And I am sure that tons of MIT students will concur. 
I don’t believe that MIT could have chosen a more perfect commencement speaker in general but also especially in these trying times. A final personal note I would like to share is that to this day whenever my hope tank is running low, I consciously turn to vlogbrothers videos to make me feel grateful to be human again.”

“Hank taught me education isn’t tests and meaningless lectures; it’s talking to people, learning for fun, and following passion. It also isn’t meant for the specific type of person, but should be accessible for all.”

“I originally found Hank through SciShow and later fully watched through both the Chemistry and Biology Crash Courses while in middle school. A lot of my early enjoyment of studying the sciences came through watching these videos, and I still super vividly remember the most random things about them. For example, I learned about the word “portmanteau” from the intro to the video on redox reactions, and about the Chunky Monkey ice cream flavor from his digestive systems video (it’s now a top 3 flavor for me!). It really feels like a full-circle moment to have him speak at my graduation, and I’m incredibly excited!”

“I relate to Hank in a lot of ways. He’s bi, I’m bi. He has ADHD* (he’s not sure himself but he admitted it’s probably true), and I relate to so much of his experiences with my own ADHD. He wants to make the world a better place, same with me. I have so many friends my age that are similar in these ways but I hardly ever find anyone that I can look up to that are like myself. Hank (and John too) has been on the Internet for so long, and seeing these positive male role models that are so unapologetically themselves, while also putting so much good into the world (I get great socks from him every month through his sock subscription service, with all profits going to charity) has been so inspiring to me. When looking at what I want my life to look like when I’m older, he’s the first person I think of.”

“I honestly don’t think I would have made it to MIT without Hank and John Green. I did not come from a background where I was pushed to excel academically past the bare minimum. Their ideas inspired me to pursue knowledge so fervently that I eventually found myself doing well enough in school that I could get into a place like MIT without ever planning to. I watched Hank and John’s videos (mostly vlogbrothers and a bit of Crash Course) religiously in my late middle and early high school years. I recall being floored and inspired by so, so many of their videos. 
I would come home thrilled to watch new vlogbrothers videos after school. Hank and John’s perspectives on education, kindness, earnestness, and curiosity were foundational for my own worldview — I remember feeling overwhelmingly determined and committed to learn *everything* in order to help *everyone* after watching their content (this has, with adulthood, sobered into a “learn as much as you can to help as many as possible in areas that are important to you”). Hank in particular pushed science, and I also watched a ton of SciShow as a young boy, hoping it would help jumpstart my science learning journey (it did!). 
To this day I am eternally grateful for the ideas that Hank and John both shared on the internet. I wish I could afford this reply enough time to write a full, coherent essay describing just how much these two men helped shape me into the person, learner, educator, and community member that I am today. I have thought about writing such essays many times over the years, especially since Hank was announced as our speaker this year. Sadly I don’t have that time right now, so I will just leave this by saying Thank You, Hank and John (or as John prefers to think of it, Thank You, John and Hank).”

“Hank has changed my perspective on how sci-fi can impact me and my worldview. I attribute passing many AP exams to Hank and John’s CrashCourse, and I absolutely adore Dear Hank and John — a comfort podcast since high school. Hank has truly set an example of what impact one can accomplish as a public, yet common, figure. The pace at which he thinks of ideas and puts the pedal to the metal is very admirable, and pushes me to do the same.”

Outside of the survey, we also reached out to Ceri, an MIT alum and current admissions officer, who actually works with Hank. Her story of meeting him for the first time and eventually working alongside him is fascinating.

Ceri R. ’16

The first time I met Hank was in April 2015. Back then, he was touring the East Coast not as a science communicator or stand-up comedian, but as the frontman of a punk rock band. I was a junior at MIT and went to his concert in Cambridge with my friend Courtney D. ’17, who was (and is) also a Nerdfighter. We met him at the stage door afterward, where he signed our ticket stubs, and Courtney embarrassed me by saying something like, “Ceri is really great at making science videos!” I’m sure Hank replied with something kind and thoughtful that I freaked out about later, even though now that moment is blurred in my memory, and I assume it has completely vanished from his. While that one interaction didn’t necessarily change the trajectory of my life, Hank certainly has in many ways—as a YouTuber, a boss, a co-podcaster, a mentor, and a friend. I would’ve been over the moon if Hank had been invited to speak at my graduation almost a decade ago, since I spent my entire time at MIT grappling with the idea of leaving the “traditional” paths of academia or industry to try and do something a little weirder. And Hank is really, really good at weird. He embodies the sense of passion and play of MIT at its best, and he actively works to break down barriers around STEM that institutions like MIT can intentionally or unintentionally enforce. I’m so excited for the 2025s to get to celebrate their time at MIT together, with him, and that silly internet careers feel more and more real with every passing moment.

For many of us, Hank was a guide long before MIT — and, now, he’s part of how we say goodbye. How full-circle.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-at-5.16.56%E2%80%AFPM.png

How I chose my classes,Andi Q. '25,2,2025-05-24T00:00:00-04:00,"Earlier this week, I finished my last exam as an MIT undergrad. It was a bittersweet moment; I was elated that I’d made it through not just 6.7800 (Inference and Information, the subject of the exam and by far the most challenging class I’ve ever taken) but four years of MIT’s often brutal and unforgiving academic gauntlet, yet also sad that I was leaving this gauntlet behind, no longer taking classes next year. Maybe this is just my MIT-induced masochism/Stockholm syndrome speaking, but I found most of my classes fun (yes, really), rewarding, and memorable (in a good way). It’s one of the reasons why I’ve written so many blog posts about my class projects here.

A major contributor to my enjoyment was 
        Course 6’s
      
 vast catalog of over 200 classes spanning everything under the sun, from music technology to open-heart surgery. The freedom to choose between so many classes enabled me to learn and apply interesting ideas across all of EECS and kept each semester fresh and exciting.

However, the ocean of choices was also quite overwhelming initially, and it took me a while to figure out exactly what I should look out for when choosing classes, especially electives. This post is about some of the things I think about that helped me navigate this ocean.



I intended this post to be more of a reflection than a guide because there’s no definitive guide to choosing classes. Everyone has a different goal for their MIT career: someone aiming to graduate early may try to maximize the number of classes they take that satisfy multiple graduation requirements; someone aiming to become the best statistician in the world may try to take every statistics class Course 6 and 
        Course 18
      
 offers; someone aiming to impress their peers may try to take notoriously challenging classes like 6.7800 in their freshman/sophomore years. All these approaches are perfectly valid. Still, I’d be more than happy if this post helps inform how you choose classes at MIT or beyond.

There are three big questions that I ask myself about any class that I’m considering taking. In order, they are:

- Will I thrive in this class if I took it 
        this semester
      
?

- Will the class be fun and engaging?

- What value would I get from taking this class?

Will I thrive in the class?

As much as I would love to be one of those MIT students who can handle 
        7+ classes per semester
      
 while still leaving time for eating, sleeping, and socializing, my schedule can only realistically accommodate 4-5 classes. To filter the catalog down to classes I could realistically take, I think about several practical considerations, such as:

- Does it fit into my schedule?

- Will it help me graduate?

- Am I prepared for the workload?

- How often is it typically offered?

… plus a few others that past bloggers like CJ have discussed, e.g. in this post.

Does it fit into my schedule?

Barring 
        one or two exceptions
      
, if a class doesn’t fit into my schedule (i.e. if its lectures overlap with anything else), then I will not take it. I think attending lectures (and office hours whenever possible) is crucial for making the most of my MIT education because otherwise, I may as well teach myself the content outside of MIT. Some classes also have exams scheduled during lecture times, so having no conflicting lectures minimizes headaches in that regard too.

Most lab-based classes also require me to be in the lab physically for several hours at a time. If I don’t have a large, contiguous chunk of free time in my schedule, then I try to avoid these kinds of classes too.

Don’t do this though, even though there are technically no conflicts

Will it help me graduate?

My top priority at MIT was to graduate. As such, I aimed to fulfill most of my graduation requirements before my senior year so that I’d be free to take fun elective classes without worrying about outstanding requirements getting in the way. Graduation requirements, particularly introductory requirements, are also good for helping me prepare for those electives.

I like to think of these graduation requirements as parts of a meal: introductory requirements are like vegetables (not particularly exciting but good for me), upper-level requirements are like meat (more exciting and varied), and electives are like dessert (fun, often the most memorable, but not required at all). I ate all my vegetables first because they provided me with vitamins and minerals (technical skills and mathematical maturity), before moving on to the meat with small bites of desserts snuck in between.

Because dessert was so enticing, I also gravitated toward classes satisfying multiple requirements whenever it made sense. For example, 6.3020 (Fundamentals of Music Processing) satisfies two requirements as (1) 
        an advanced undergrad subject
      
 and (2) 
        a music class
      
, while 6.2050 (Digital Systems Laboratory) satisfies four(!) requirements because it’s (1) 
        an advanced undergrad subject
      
, (2) 
        has a project-based lab component
      
 that (3) 
        focuses on technical writing
      
 and (4) 
        is open-ended and worth >40% of the final grade
      
. (It just so happens that this property is most common in lab/project-based classes, which I was most interested in taking anyway.)

Am I prepared for the workload?

It’s always tempting 
        for me
      
 to answer yes to this question because I think I could handle any single class in the Course 6 catalog. However, that answer would be misleading because it’s only really true in isolation. Things get much more complicated when there are commitments like clubs and other classes also vying for my attention.

I’d typically try to pick a set of classes that add up to around 
        50 hours per week
      
 based on my estimate of their workloads. To estimate the hourly workload of a class, I’d look at the average number of hours per week 
        reported by past students
      
 and then adjust up or down by a few hours based on how many of its prerequisite classes I’d taken. For example, past students in 6.S987 (Physics and Engineering of Superconducting Qubits) spent around 11 hours per week on it, while I spent closer to 13 hours because I didn’t have the quantum physics prerequisites.

Additionally, I’d try to have a balance between classes with final exams and those with final projects. Although projects sound more fun and rewarding than exams (and indeed they often are), I’ve learned the hard way that having four simultaneous final projects is often much less fun than having four final exams.

How often is the class typically offered?

Not every class is offered every year! Some classic examples in Course 6 are:

- Erik Demaine’s trio of 6.5310 (Geometric Folding Algorithms), 6.5230 (Advanced Data Structures), and 6.5440 (Algorithmic Lower Bounds), which are offered in a three-year cycle.

- Dave Perreault’s 6.S892 (Advanced Topics in Power Electronics), which is offered once every ~four years.

Will the class be fun and engaging?

After filtering the catalog down to classes I could take, I’d further filter it down to classes I might want to take. This step is usually fairly straightforward. My interests are broad but well-defined (for example, I know that I’m not interested in power electronics, theoretical computer science, or biomedical applications of EECS), and the syllabi/course evaluations tell me most of what I need to know. Some things I’d think about here are:

- Are any of my friends taking it? (It’s more fun to take classes with friends.)

- How big is the average class size? (Medium/small-ish classes with 40 people or fewer tend to be the most enjoyable because I can get more individual attention from the instructors.)

- What did past students think of it? (Asking a past student in person is ideal, but the course evaluations also have a numerical rating out of 7 that I use as a quick benchmark.)

- Do the instructors care about teaching? (Being a leader in their field or having a Nobel prize doesn’t automatically translate to being good at teaching, unfortunately.)

- What’s in the syllabus? (If there’s visibly little care put into the syllabus, there will probably also be little care put into lectures.)

- How long has it been around? (Newer classes are fun because they teach more cutting-edge content, but older classes typically have better organization.)

What value would I get from taking the class?

Finally, I’d filter the catalog down to classes I should take. The two main things I’d think about each class at this point are:

- Could I recreate the experience outside of MIT?

- How useful is it?

Could I recreate the experience outside of MIT?

One of the main reasons why I chose to attend MIT was because of all the educational resources here that I wouldn’t be able to experience elsewhere, such as:

- Specialized lab equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars like the machines in the MIT.nano cleanroom and the “Quantenkoffer” quantum optics toolkit, which I had the opportunity to operate as part of 6.2600 (Micro/Nano Processing Technology) and 6.2410 (Quantum Systems Engineering Lab).

- Brilliant people like Will Oliver, Karl Berggren, and Joe Steinmeyer, who know and can explain their respective fields better than anyone else on the planet (and certainly better than a textbook).

- Detailed and personalized feedback on assignments, writing, etc., which I wouldn’t get from self-study alone.

Given how much MIT tuition costs, I aimed to take full advantage of these resources by prioritizing taking classes that teach things I wouldn’t be able to learn or experience outside of MIT. Hardware-based electrical engineering classes like 6.2600 and 6.2410 above immediately come to mind in this category; as do classes with unique structures and/or topics like 6.5310 (Geometric Folding Algorithms, which involves working with Erik Demaine on open problems in computational origami design).

This is also one of the reasons why I didn’t take many computer science classes like 6.1810 (Operating Systems Engineering). All the lecture notes, assignments, etc. for those classes are available online, and their structures prevent me from receiving meaningful feedback on my work. After all, if I could learn the content at home, why should I come to MIT for it? (To be clear, I’m not saying these are bad classes. I just think they don’t give me as much value as I could get elsewhere at MIT.)

How useful is it?

“Usefulness” is a somewhat nebulous concept. Sure, a class is certainly useful if it helps me pass a job interview or teaches me how to use a specific tool in my research, but its usefulness can extend far beyond these “hard” skills.

For example, 6.2060 (Microcomputer Project Laboratory) is a class that, at first glance, doesn’t seem very useful at all. The lab assignments all involve programming an obsolete Intel 8051 microprocessor to perform seemingly mundane tasks like striking a fluorescent lamp. I’ll probably never be asked to program an Intel 8051 again in my career, but I’d still argue that 6.2060 was one of the most useful classes I’ve taken at MIT because it taught me so many “soft” skills that are pervasive in all of engineering, including:

- How to document and communicate my work clearly and concisely.

- How to separate complex systems into simpler individual components.

- How to design diagnostic tests for complex systems to identify what’s going wrong.

- How to manage my time and budget in a large, multi-week project.

- How to identify and search for the information you need (without the help of AI).

Quoting the syllabus: “Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology.”

The most useful classes I’ve taken taught a combination of hard and soft skills. 6.7800 (Inference and Information) is the one that immediately comes to mind (perhaps because it’s still fresh on my mind). Not only did it teach many useful probability/statistics/information theory techniques (which are directly applicable to my job after graduation), but it also greatly improved my intuition for thinking about complex modeling problems.

Appendix: A short guide to deciphering Course 6 subject numbers

Back in ye olden days (i.e., three years ago), Course 6 subject numbers were a mess. Unlike other departments like Course 2, which has a sensible 2.001 → 2.002 → … → 2.009 numbering system for the core undergrad sequence, Course 6 seemed to have wacky uncorrelated numbers that you just had to memorize. For example, the sequence of classes about algorithms had the following structure:

Why is 6.006 numbered lower than 6.042, its prerequisite class? Why is the numbering for the grad-level classes (the ones after 6.046) completely different from the undergrad-level classes? What do any of the numbers even mean?

So when Course 6 introduced the new 6-4 major (AI and Decision Making) in 2022, they also introduced a new numbering system to fix this mess, resulting in over 200(!) classes being renumbered. Although this change was quite controversial amongst the upperclassmen (many of us still prefer to use the old numbers), I think it was ultimately a step in the right direction, given how much Course 6 has ballooned in size and scope over the past two decades.

The department has a great page that explains the new numbering system, but the TL;DR is:

- Subject numbers now have 4 digits (6.xxxx)

- The first digit encodes the class’s level (1-4 for undergrad, 5-8 for grad) and broad subject area ({1, 5} for algorithms/software systems, {2, 6} for circuits/applied physics, {3, 7} for signals/statistics/machine learning, and {4, 8} for AI/robotics/biomedical).

- The second digit encodes the class’s subarea (e.g., 6.12xx for algorithms). Again, see the page I linked for specific subareas.

- The third digit separates classes in the subarea, typically counting up from 0 and with intro-level classes numbered lower.

- The fourth digit is mostly vestigial; it’s 0 for most classes but is occasionally used to specify the version of a class with a joint undergrad/grad offering.

For example, here’s how I would read a random course number:

Indeed, 6.2410 is Quantum Systems Engineering Lab.

And here’s what the algorithms sequence looks like under the new numbering system:



Knowing how the new numbering system works is useful because it provides an easy way to find new classes related to ones you’ve previously taken and enjoyed. For example, if you enjoyed 6.3000 (Signal Processing), there’s a good chance you’d also enjoy 6.3010 (Signals, Systems, and Inference) or 6.3020 (Fundamentals of Music Processing).","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/too-many-choices-800x600.png

Finite games where the goal is to win on a finite time horizon.


Finite games where the goal is to win on a finite time horizon.

Infinite games where the goal is to keep contributing to the indefinite play of the game itself. For example, art, scientific discovery, humanism, etc…


Infinite games where the goal is to keep contributing to the indefinite play of the game itself. For example, art, scientific discovery, humanism, etc…

When I discovered this dichotomy in high-school I resolved to play infinite games. To find and fight for the beautiful ideals in this world. To shout from the past and into the future – here I lay a small piece of this rich tapestry! I see what you have done and put down this stroke for all that you will do!

But I have noticed in the way people practice everything from philosophy to ai or even math – that the finite often comes clamping down on ideas of infinity – researchers fold to academic pressures and compromise on the quality of their work to get grants, artists get stuck in bubbles that make it hard for them to broaden their horizons, and students like me get swayed by status games and jump into industries they don’t care about so someone will reward them for being useful.

In all of these cases, we are brought down by our hunger (literal and metaphorical), our desire to prove ourselves, and the realistic impulse to be a part of and be recognized by the seductive structures of society. So it seems that many a man, living a life in so-called pursuit of high seas and those lauded ideals, is rarely able to see beyond his local bay, his glorious ship in reality just a small piece of flotsam, floating back and forth in the small corner of how him and his peers see their well delimited region of the world, him in it.

We try to go beyond our finite scale and identify with an effectively infinite universe, but is it really possible? Can we use our finite lives to cross through those waters and above tremendous waves to find new ground?

Maybe we are too limited by reality – we need resources to survive, we have to make ourselves legible and work with others, and we are surrounded by harsh feedback loops. On top of that, society instills this mindset by punishing or rewarding us based on our work and how good it is, starting in school. This process cements our desire for recognition, and harms our creativity by subduing it to an audience.

This is dangerous because our education couples the infinite game of art and creativity with the finite one of local validation and reward. It teaches us there is this nearby signal of quality which is reflective of art more generally, and of our worth. And so we start replacing the goal with its measure. We let the finite scope of our lives, the validation and constraints surrounding us implicitly replace the infinite target.

Maybe this tension is inevitable. But maybe not, and perhaps this tension arises precisely because we frame the infinite game as something for an individual to pursue rather than something for the world to inhabit – as an individual’s foray rather than a tree of parallel paths. If finite games are about separation, the self winning against the other, maybe infinite games are not really games played by individuals but a singular expression of unity— erasing the boundary between you and the world you engage with. Shunryu Suzuki’s Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind, urges for this shift from pursuit to raw presence:


 





 




This perspective renounces goal driven behavior, prioritizing awareness and a sense of unity with the world. All self centered thought limits our vast mind. The goal was never the point. Act strictly in the moment.

This is hard, and might seem grossly unintuitive or incomprehensible. I personally have internalized the frame of the goal, the objective, the meme of success and efficiency.

But when you hide away your sense of self to purely engage with the world, the actions you take feel more natural, boundaries dissolve, and your perception is enhanced. This is flow, like Arjuna focusing in the Mahabharata (quoting my last post):


Dronacharya gave a test to his students. He showed them the bird and said, what do you see? One by one they said the bird, the leaves, the trees, the people around, etc… And then he asked Arjuna: what do you see? And Arjuna looked onto the bird and the storm calmed and the leaf stopped its course and his breath shortened and for a moment he stood at the edge and the world shrunk until there was no longer such a thing as an edge and he saw what the bird was and he said: I see its eyes. And then his limbs moved of their own accord and he drew his arrow and shot it straight into its eyes. For Arjuna the question of control and trajectory and choice and energy dissolve into the simple reality that the world is in front of you and the wind is pushing you straight forward and your legs are walking onwards and your eyes are staring down the path and all you see is the eyes of bird. And then there is no notion of control or you and your shape hitting against the world there is simply the motion of life slipping from one moment to the next in fundamentally the only trajectory that made sense.

And then there is no notion of control or you and your shape hitting against the world there is simply the motion of life slipping from one moment to the next in fundamentally the only trajectory that made sense.

It seems to me that the lifeblood of the infinite game is the person who is defined by this state of flow, and this deep love of the essence of the game. This class of individual is deeply motivated by the thing for what it is, and deeply free by nature of this fact. That freedom is what allows them to actually innovate, and ignite those campfires which other players will gather around, like new movements, new styles, or new ways of seeing the world.

In Critique of Judgement, Kant defines genius as “the mental predisposition through which nature gives the rule to art”. The genius is then precisely this individual that is able to uncover the new rules of the game, by escaping the mold defined by the rest of society and the standards of what exists. The genius rejects those constraints to stare deeply at the world and find these new rules emerge from nature like diamonds shining in the dark! The genius has the depth of courage required to be happy looking at the world alone2, and the intensity to decompose and dive into nature to understand it, both its physical reality (in doing science), or one’s authentic and shared experience of it (art). The genius’ reward is to appreciate the new structure created or discovered, and see the world smoothly move onward.

This is how you play the real infinite game – jumping out into the wide open sea at full mast, in love with the world, momentarily forgetting that there is even a tomorrow to account for, and starting to see something worth looking at and understanding in the distance.

In that case, the path to infinity is simply now. What do you see? Look outside, it’s beautiful.",,0
Answer these 13 questions and we’ll reveal the perfect dorm for you!,Ellie F. '28,12,2025-05-22T00:00:00-04:00,"The Quiz: HEY GUYS UPDATE THE LINK DOESNT WORK ANYMORE ILL TRY TO FIX IT SOB


OK I THINK IT WORKS NOW LMK IF IT BREAKS



Behind the Scenes:

This started months ago as some joke-turned-blog-idea on the MIT class of 2029 Discord Server, where I was helping out answering questions from the prefrosh. MIT has very strong dorm culture, and each of our dorms has its own traditions, in-jokes, and lifestyles. I thought that writing an interactive Buzzfeed-style quiz would be a fun way to find interesting patterns and learn more about the people in dorms overall.

The plan was to create some questions and disseminate them through dormspam, our undergraduate-wide emailing list. Then, I could analyze the answers and their corresponding dorms to create the quiz for the blogs. Despite multiple months of sitting on this idea, I didn’t start creating questions until the day before the dorm decision form was released for prefrosh (sorry that this quiz is so late lol). I dormspammed the survey in the middle of my Asian Dance Team showcase and watched in awe as responses started rolling in. (I think I got like 50 responses in 10 minutes?? what)

A couple days later, I started the data analysis (instead of studying for finals, of course). Turns out I’m bad at spreadsheets, so I just made a bunch of jank formulas to find each question’s response distribution by dorm. Then, I found an online personality quiz maker and translated those results to the quiz’s answer scoring system. This took longer than it should have.

Fun Stats!

Here’s the results spreadsheet (it’s a copy) if you want to do your own digging: COOL DATA HERE

Quick Numbers

- As of right now, there are 300 responses! WOW :0

- Burton-Conner had the most responses, with 42

- Random had the least responses, with 13

- However, Random had the highest response per capita, with 14% of all Random residents responding to the poll.

- New Vassar had the lowest response per capita, with only 3.3% of New Vassar residents providing their data to my quiz.

Most Agreed Upon Answers (among dorm)

- 100% — MacGregor, with 0 roommates across the board. MacGregor in fact only has singles, so this shouldn’t be very surprising!

- 91.7% — Random, naming a nearby grocery store as what they can’t live without. Random is a cook-for-yourself dorm on Massachusetts Ave., a very short walk to Target or Hmart, so it must be very convenient!

- 85.7% — New Vassar, agreeing that they couldn’t live without air conditioning. As the newest dorm, one of New Vassar’s attractions is being one of two dorms with built-in AC.

- 83.3% — Random, also with 0 roommates. Random is mostly singles, with just a few doubles per floor, so this checks out.

- 81.8% — New House, agreeing with New Vassar on the necessity of AC.

- 81.3% — Maseeh, as the closest dorm to main campus, values proximity to campus above all, to little surprise.

Other fun facts!

Is it true that Baker has the most athletes? 73.1% of Baker residents responded that they were athletes, followed by 37.5% of Maseeh and 28.6% of New Vassar.

While “baby’s first speed rap (l,m,n,o,p)”, with 35.7% of responses, tended to be the crowd’s favorite alphabet section, the East Side dorms, East Campus (EC) and Random, had a marked preference for the “weirdo/goth letters (v,w,x,y,z)”, which won 30.6% of East Side votes.

Maseeh, the closest dorm to campus, seems to love convenience as much as the farthest dorms want it. 50% of Maseeh respondents chose the superpower of being able to travel as quickly as a car, compared to 44.8% for Next House and 50% for Simmons, the two farthest dorms on Dorm Row.

The most ~aesthetic~ dorms were Random Hall with 41.7% for Dark Academia and McCormick with 38.1% for Cottagecore. No other dorms had more votes for one of the listed aesthetics than none of them.

Most dorms love cooking for themselves during Independent Activities Period (IAP), when meal plans are optional for everyone. Baker was the only dorm where any option was selected more than cooking — a whopping 65.3% of Baker respondents chose to eat at Maseeh, compared to only 31.3% of Maseeh respondents. MacGregor is home to the most scavengers, with 41.7% hunting down free food for sustenance. On the other hand, 44.4% of Nexties have given up and simply responded with “food?”.

Only two respondents preferred zero windows (honestly I expected more). Most people showed a strong preference to one or two windows, likely the amount of windows in their own dorm room. Predictably, 64.3% Simmons residents showed their love for 18 windows, or possibly even more.

Burton Conner (BC) has the biggest chunk of partiers, with 65.8% of BC residents partying on a Friday night, followed by EC with 48.6% and New House with 42.4%.

The cat dorms really love their cats! 73% of EC and and 66.7% of Random voted for cats as the best dorm animal, and cats also won over BC, MacGregor, and New House. Next House, Baker, and McCormick have forged strong bonds with their rats, and New Vassar and Simmons had more dog people (Simmons has a house dog!!)

I am lethally bored in the airport,Aiden H. '28,3,2025-05-22T00:00:00-04:00,"I am coming to you live from the coveted Boston Logan International Airport Terminal C Gate 28 31!!🤮🤮

Today was move-out day, and 
        HRS
      
 mandated that we move out by noon. Not realizing this until after I booked my flight, though, I realized I had a very unfortunate amount of time between move-out and needing to be at the airport. I could push my 4 bags around the actively raining Boston streets acting like I’m gonna do something all day, or suck it up and spend like 7 hours at the airport. I opted for the latter.

So if you ever wanted to find out how to do the airport 
        Aiden Style™,
      
 here’s my advice:

- Get to the airport so early that you learn that you can actually be too early to check your bags (boo)

- Sit at the entrance of the airport near ticketing for 40 minutes while waiting for it to hit 12:50 so you can check your bags for your 6:50 flight

- Play Tetris while waiting

- Get mad you’re not that good at Tetris

- Check to see if any more final grades have come out (they haven’t)

- Eat a pack of blueberry BelVita cookies that you stole from the Maseeh 2 lounge on your way out

- Check your bags

- Ask the ticketing person if you can move to an earlier flight, only to be told no because you bought the cheapest ticket possible (boo)

- For the first time, get excited that security is taking a while (still only 30 minutes though)

- Head straight to Shake Shack

- Get sad you won’t have Shake Shack for 3 months

- Eat Shake Shack and look for summer jobs

- Listen to Charli XCX

- Act like you’re gonna work on your UROP

- Debate paying for more Shake Shack

- Check to see if any more final grades have come out (they haven’t)

- Think about how annoying that 
        7.03
      
 final was

- Realize you haven’t even been at the airport for 2 hours

- Start writing this blog post and then notice you have to get through the whole airport experience before you can post it anyway

- Read the New York Times

- Judge all the people who wear actual day clothes to the airport

- Watch Succession

- Wonder why you didn’t watch Succession sooner

- Walk over to your gate 2.5 hours before boarding starts

- Try to find a water fountain

- Wonder why they would put water fountains everywhere if they don’t work

- Decide to be dehydrated because you’d rather be thirsty than walk back through the terminal with your 1000 lb bags to get water

- Check to see if any more final grades have come out (they haven’t)

- Call your grandma

- Go online shopping

- Give yourself a pep-talk to write so many blogs on this flight because you really want to buy these clothes

- Get a gate change notification from JetBlue and act like life is really hard, even though you have so much time to get there (it’s three gates down) (boo)

- Find water!

- Reread about that time Kayode tried to run to this very airport

- Think about 
        that episode
      
 of Modern Family where Cam and Mitchell take sleeping pills and then walk around the airport really high

- Remember all those news articles about how sitting is the new smoking and try to calculate how many metaphorical packs you’re smoking today between the 6.5 hours of airport sitting plus the 4-5 hour flight

- Watch another episode of Succession

- Check one last time to see if any more final grades have come out (they haven’t)

- Mess with WordPress for like 30 minutes

- Board the flight",,0
What is the value of college?,David duKor-Jackson,2,2025-05-21T00:00:00-04:00,"I spent the beginning of this week in the company of a select group of college enrollment leaders and college counselors from across the country and around the world. Spending time in settings like these is personally and professionally affirming, if for no other reason than the fact that they provide a reminder that the vast majority of those who do this work are committed, first and foremost, to helping young people reach their aspirations.

Even though the challenges faced vary from role to role and institution to institution, some common themes emerged. While there were many issues that we wrestled with, the topic that I found most salient revolved around the value of higher education, which frankly is only in question because educational institutions have abdicated their responsibility to articulate the transformative impact that they should be having on every student who passes through their doors.

Whether schools believe that their value is manifest or they are simply preoccupied catering to the whims of a transactional public who view education solely as a means to an end, many seem to have lost the plot.

At MIT, we are mission-forward. Institutional decision making, writ large, and our admission selection process are guided by service to our mission, which I tend to summarize as utilizing our collective energy and intellect to solve the world’s biggest problems, although the full Mission Statement reads…

“The mission of MIT is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.

The Institute is committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges. MIT is dedicated to providing its students with an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a diverse campus community. We seek to develop in each member of the MIT community the ability and passion to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind.”

We begin every information session with a primer on our mission, so I think it would be difficult to come away from a visit with a member of our staff without having an appreciation for the value of an MIT education. While I know the inherent value of an educational experience on this campus, I also believe in the value of educational experiences available on other campuses. My belief, however, is no match for the broad societal skepticism about the ROI on most undergraduate degrees. It is incumbent on all of us to do better. Colleges and universities need to do a better job of centering their missions, specifically as they relate to the impact of their educational experience on their graduates, and prospective students and families need to demand more than a credential certifying that one has met the requirements for a degree.

So students, as you are exploring campuses in the process of building out your list of schools to which you will likely apply, make sure that you are asking substantive questions about the transformative impact of an undergraduate experience and the ways in which an institution’s mission aligns with your own goals for the future, in addition to your questions about dormitories, dining halls and climbing walls.",,0
Am I rural or small-town?,Nicole Cooper,1,2025-05-19T00:00:00-04:00,"Well, are you rural?

You might have heard about the STARS College Network—which stands for Small-Town and Rural Students—and wondered,  “Am I from a rural or small town?”. This is an iteration of one of the most common questions I get at college fairs and webinars: 

 “Does MIT consider {insert town name I have never heard of} a small town in their admission process?” 

 “Does MIT consider {insert town name I have never heard of} a small town in their admission process?” 

While I know the ideal answer to the question above is a solid “yes” or “no,” rurality is much more nuanced than that. Answering that question without more information can be reductive to your lived experience. However, I can help you think about place and how it shapes your access to resources, your perspective, and your resilience, and the inherent strengths of this experience.

 So this is where I come in: because at the end of the day, it’s about your lived experience, not just your zip code.

Understanding rurality and small-town life: Starting with the data

Figuring out what rural and small-town means isn’t as simple as drawing a line on a map. The U.S. Census Bureau defines “rural” as basically everything that isn’t an urban area. Not super helpful, right? The USDA provides further guidance with maps. 

USDA Map



When reading applications, we try our best to get a good sense of the place(s) in which you’ve grown up—reading up on how a place has developed over the last twenty years, using Google Maps to see how far away common resources are (I mentioned Taco Bell earlier because we jokingly call that our Taco Bell Index, but it’s much more than just Taco Bells), or seeing how long it takes most of your neighbors to drive to work.

While they can be a great starting point for us (and for you) to understand the size of your town, and its relation to resources often found in larger cities, these definitions and tools don’t really capture the true essence of what it is like to live in a rural area or a small town (even though I do care about how long it takes you to drive to get a Crunchwrap Supreme). Here at MIT, we don’t refer to rural as “everything else that is left” because these spaces and places are much more than that. They have strengths and texture that bring value to campus communities, that are largely missing (but we are working on changing that!).

Your essays are the next step to understanding your experience, and are a great place to help an admission officer understand your hometown and how it has shaped you beyond the US Census. We focus on your story: how growing up has shaped your perspective, resilience, and problem-solving abilities. 

What are we looking for in a small-town or rural area?

When we talk about rural and small-town students, we’re not just hunting for zip codes or checking boxes. We’re valuing the kind of life and how it shapes—the grit, the creativity, and the deep sense of community that comes from growing up in places where everyone knows your name (and probably your dog’s, too).

It is important to think about the shared commonalities of rural and small-towns, like a lack of public transportation, small class sizes, dirt roads, no major airports, or a sport franchise. A place where you are often surrounded by large masses of land, where cows on drives are common, and the state-fair and backyard cookouts make the highlights of the year. 

I always say, 

“If you’ve seen one rural or small town, you’ve seen…well…one rural or small town.”

“If you’ve seen one rural or small town, you’ve seen…well…one rural or small town.”

These communities are incredibly diverse, each with its own character, strengths, and quirks.  

Maybe you live in a town where “traffic” means waiting behind a line of combines during harvest season, being stopped behind a cattle drive, or where your high school’s idea of a college fair is a stack of brochures in the counselor’s office. Perhaps the nearest Taco Bell is a full tank of gas away. Maybe you’ve gotten really good at fixing things yourself because the nearest specialty store is two counties over. Or maybe you’re from a small town where Friday night football is practically a holiday and every face in the bleachers is familiar. You might live in a place with one main street, where the coffee shop is the heartbeat of the community, and your teacher is also your neighbor and your cousin’s basketball coach. Where you don’t have AP courses, and where going to college means going to a 2-year institution (which is great, but not for everyone).

We’re talking about students who live it, students who know what it means to attend a school where AP classes are few and far between, if they exist at all. Where they have to advocate for their classes, drive 30 minutes to their dual credit course, and know what a hardship permit is.  Where participating in a robotics competition means borrowing equipment from neighboring districts or building prototypes out of spare parts found in your uncles shop. Where accessing a science lab with proper equipment requires a two-hour drive to the nearest community college.

These are students who travel hours for college fairs or rely on virtual tours because campus visits aren’t feasible and the sight of an Ivy League institution in their hometown is unheard of. It’s about learning to maximize the resources available like joining 4-H or FFA to get hands-on experience with agriculture and engineering, volunteering at local clinics to explore healthcare, or building makeshift studios in basements for art and design projects. Perhaps some of these descriptors resonate with you.

Your story matters and what this means for you: 

These experiences, no matter how small they seem, bring something valuable to MIT. They offer perspectives that are grounded, innovative, and refreshingly different. When you’re used to making the most of what you have, you see possibility where others might not. For example, some students talk about using scrap materials to build a clubhouse, fix a fence, or repair farm equipment or organizing community events (like prom) in the high school gym because it’s the largest gathering space in town.These are all characteristics that mold a perspective. Rural and small-town aren’t just map dots. They’re mindsets, a way of thinking creatively that adds to the classroom in innovative ways.

While rural and small-town experiences are something we pay attention to, it’s important to know that this isn’t about admitting rural students instead of urban students. It’s about finding talent in places that have historically been overlooked. Expanding our reach means uncovering brilliance that may have otherwise gone unseen—not shifting the scales, but widening the lens. MIT isn’t just trying to “diversify” for diversity’s sake; we’re building a community of problem-solvers with a wide range of perspectives and skills. And rurality and small-town life come with their own set of strengths. Which is why we need you to share these strengths with us! If you’ve grown up doing more with less, solving problems creatively, and supporting your community along the way, you already have many of the qualities we look for in MIT students.

TLDR; if you’re wondering, “Does knowing how to drive a tractor or starting a community garden in a town with one stoplight matter to admission officers?”—the answer is a resounding YES. Tell us your rural and small-town story. Take advantage of the STARS College Network and the free programs that MIT and other institutions plan and host to help you with the college application process so you can better learn how your unique strengths gained from living in a rural area or small-town are important in the process.  Share what your place, your home, your community has taught you. It doesn’t have to look like anyone else’s. Because just like every small town is its own world, every student’s story is its own adventure. We want to hear yours.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-19-at-11.24.26%E2%80%AFAM-400x329.png,1
setting things on fire,Kanokwan T. '26,4,2025-05-18T00:00:00-04:00,"I had a funny realization. I found myself setting something on fire 3 different times in the same week—twice for classes, once for a club—and each ignition taught me something new.

voosh!

For my 2.671 Measurement and Instrumentation class,

- Fire spread speed increased linearly with wind speed up to a threshold, beyond which the relationship decayed exponentially until reaching a “blow-out” point: where wind no longer aided spread but instead extinguished the flame.

- Wind positioning was most effective when directed at the plume of hot gases above the flame, enhancing convective heat transfer, rather than aimed directly at the flame itself.

reviewing my classes this semester,Gloria Z. '26,2,2025-05-17T00:00:00-04:00,"This semester, due to a 
        careening series of events
      
, I took an ill-advised courseload of 8 classes, totaling 96 units. In the spirit of procrastinating finals studying, here are my thoughts on each of them :-).

 

(1) incredible, spectacular, no notes

These were my favorite classes this semester! I found them really rewarding, with a generally fair amount of assignments, and they covered material that I had little to no exposure to beforehand.

11.067: Land Use Law and Politics: Race, Place, and Law

This course surveyed US property law through a legal and social justice lens; specifically, we covered property, land use, equal protection, civil rights, fair housing, and local government law. Each week’s readings consisted of a set of relevant court cases, plus the occasional theoretical or philosophical legal reading. We went over a lot of key constitutional rights, challenges, and debates, and apart from those questions being very… relevant in recent months, it felt really cool to have the tools to understand and analyze key court cases in American history. The professor was also a great lecturer and very engaging!

For our final project, my teammates Sabine, Emily, Amira, Ari, and I made this unfolding zine that summarized some of the core themes of the class:

MAS.s63: Recreating the Past

Taught by members of the Future Sketches group in the Media Lab, this class centered on computational and new media art from the past few decades. Every week, we learned about a specific artist or set of artists, then, as homework, recreated an artwork by them using modern-day frameworks and computational tools. I feel like the class really made me understand what was so entrancing about computation back when computers were first being developed — things that feel completely normal to us now like motion graphics were completely new and magical at the time. I got to try out new frameworks like p5.js and paper.js and make some neat stuff! It was also a tiny class, only about 3 students each time, so each session felt more like a discussion and shared art appreciation session than a traditional lecture.

 

(2) so frustrating but so rewarding

These were my two coding/engineering classes this semester, and they definitely delivered on that front. I’ve never stared at VSCode so much in my life.

6.5840: Distributed Computer Systems Engineering

A distributed system is a collection of computers that interact with each other in order to achieve some goal. For example, the Google search engine uses distributed technologies, because there’s no way one computer can handle that much search traffic; instead, a massive network of computers communicate in order to serve millions of consistent search results per second. However, this interconnectedness brings about a host of problems: what happens if messages between computers are dropped, duplicated, or interfered with mid-send? What if some computers crash and others have to 1) recognize the crash and 2) pick up the slack?

Turns out, a lot of interesting algorithms and network architectures have been developed in the past thirty years to address these issues, and this class consisted of a series of labs in which we implemented some of those solutions. In particular, the most difficult system by far to implement was called Raft – a “consensus” algorithm that enables a set of computers to agree on a shared sequence of client operations. Omitting the grimy technical details, I’ll just say that Raft was extremely hard to debug due to the nondeterministic(ish) nature of the program and sheer length of debug logs… I have never felt so defeated by a single file with less than 700 lines of code. However, we made it through 🤞🤞 with a better appreciation of the technologies underpinning the fast and speedy internet we all take for granted. I also learned (somewhat) how to code in Golang.

debugging raft was like this but imagine it goes on forever

6.1100: Computer Language Engineering

In this class we wrote a compiler! You ever wonder how something like this:

generic code snippet

gets turned into something that a computer can execute? After all, a computer is just an amalgamation of cleverly arranged circuitry; it has no notion of what an “if statement” or “for loop” is. Thus, a compiler is a program that does the hard work of translating “high level” code such as Python or C++ into hardware-specific Assembly code and subsequently a binary executable (1s and 0s). 

This entire class consisted of one project (the eponymous compiler), so the difficult part was structuring that large, complicated codebase in a way that was 1) flexible 2) easily maintainable and 3) relatively quick to implement. It was honestly a lot of fun – frustrating at times, but (at least for me) nowhere near as soul-crushing as distributed systems was. It helped that my teammates Selena and Andrew were really great! This was also my first time using Rust. In celebration of finishing the class, we made custom cyanotyped shirts :-).

 

(3) what the box said

These classes were fine; they delivered on what they promised, so I don’t really have any specific gripes or praises. I’m glad I took them!

4.250: Introduction to Urban Design and Development

This is the intro undergraduate DUSP class, surveying topics such as street networks and neighborhoods, the history of zoning in the US, and city planning movements like New Urbanism. I think this is one of those classes that is really necessary and important but maybe not so scintillating on a daily basis (as intro classes often are). However, I did really enjoy some of the guest lectures, particularly one that focused on the failures (or perceived thereof) of public housing projects in the US. At the end of the semester, we went on a walking tour of two nearby sites – Cambridge Crossing and the Seaport District – where the actual city planners who worked on those projects came and talked us through the decisions behind each location’s developments, which was really insightful.

11.c35: Interactive Data Visualization and Society

In 11.c35, we worked in teams to create a web-based “visualization journey” (think journalism-style interactive data stories, but not nearly as polished) about housing trends in the greater Boston area. The class was partnered with Metropolitan Area Planning Council (the regional planning agency in this area), so MAPC representatives would provide feedback periodically on the direction of each project. Our team focused specifically on the subtheme of corporate speculation, so our data visualizations centered on ballooning rent prices, eviction rates, and the impact that corporate landlords have on the housing market. Overall it was a fun class, and although I wasn’t as excited about the day-to-day work of web development, the housing concepts and design/storytelling aspects of the assignments were pretty new and interesting.

(4) good classes I’m sure but I just wasn’t that into it

18.212: Algebraic Combinatorics

Unfortunately I could not tell you much about algebraic combinatorics despite having taken this class… I do think the material was interesting enough, but I just didn’t have the time or energy to fully appreciate it beyond doing the (only four) problem sets.

i made this meme are you proud :D

6.4110: Representation, Inference, and Reasoning in AI

Broadly, this class explored various ways to represent the process of “decision-making” with feedback and controls, primarily through the lens of robotics. There was a lot of probability and a lot of graph search! Again, interesting concepts, but it kind of fell by the wayside as my other classes took priority.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my classes this semester, given the constraints (needing to get all my units in so I can graduate)!! Some stats:

- Energy drinks consumed: only 1 😼

- Sitting (!) naps taken in Rotch Library: 4

- New buildings unlocked: 2 (bldg 9 for 11.067, bldg 54 for 6.5840)

- Crash outs over debugging Raft: 3

Scootah Hockey,Ellie F. '28,3,2025-05-13T00:00:00-04:00,"Every few seasons, the hallowed concrete walls of Simmons Hall come alive with the echoes of laughter and plastic pucks and the ritual shouts of “ON YOUR SCOOTAH!” This season, it was our fair and brave president Eugenie who led this time-honored tradition: the sacred game of Scootah Hockey.

Scootah Hockey, while rich in history and strategy, is a simple game to play. Each team has three to four players on at a time, each of whom rides on a noble steed–those scooters that you used to sit your butt on in PE class. Each player was also gifted a weapon of pure magic by the name of “short hockey stick”, with which they may launch the puck around the rink, and hopefully, into the goal. However, each goal is guarded by a vigilant goalie with the power to apprehend nearby pucks and send them back out into the fray. 

Clearly, Scootah Hockey has no power without its teams, and so, the tangled maze of Simmons Hall floors split up into their respective GRA sections and painted their team spirit into the very fabric upon their backs. We also ate some yummy snacks while making our shirts.

Now, the time to play draws near. Each night, three contests were held, points tallied, and glory awarded with the blow of the big plastic horn thing we have for some reason. Those who came to spectate the festivities were met with different feasts each day–fried chicken, sushi, mochinuts, brownies, and more. Gathered around the walls of the rink were GRAs and friends cheering for whichever team they owed their loyalty. My debut on the rink was chaotic, and despite good resistance from our opponents, my teammates and I won 1 to 0. Afterwards, I felt aches in muscles as of yet never discovered.

The revelry continued in this way for five nights, and then the final bracket was revealed to much fanfare. My team, C Tower, was seeded first, and with the sunrise on Saturday came the last playoffs. In a heartbreaking turn of events, we were defeated by A Tower, a worthy team, which, in the final seconds of the final, won the Scootah Hockey Championship. And thus, another tournament of Scootah Hockey, with its victories and defeats, would be written into the annals of Simmons Hall.

Awesome Robot Competition? LIVE??,Kayode D. '27,4,2025-05-12T00:00:00-04:00,"Do you LOVE robots? Do you LOVE Wicked? Do you LOOOOOVEE FREE BODY DIAGRAMS??

 

Well then, you’re going to LOVE the 2.007 Manufacturing and Design Final competition!!! This semester, MIT students have been working tirelessly to create robots to overcome this year’s challenge board, themed after the movie Wicked! Both me and Veronica P. ’27 are taking the class and plan to write a longer blog about our experiences, but we couldn’t let you all miss out on the BEST PART!!

The culmination of 2.007 is the final robot competition, where students for a single-run showcase on Monday to earn as many points as possible, and a top 32-robot single-elimination tournament on Tuesday!

Quote from an email: “Each head-to-head match is a dynamic demonstration of mechanical design, systems integration, and iterative thinking. Cheer on the competitors as they deliver poppies to Munchkinland, climb the sloped yellow brick road, gather iconic items in Oz, and attempt to free the flying monkeys!”

The entire competition will be live streamed Monday 5-10 and Tuesday 6:30-10 here! Come check out the stream and see the fruits of our robotic labor pay off.

Shoulder Season Treat,David duKor-Jackson,0,2025-05-12T00:00:00-04:00,"I have heard the term “Shoulder Season” to characterize the time between peak and off-peak travel seasons, and the fleetingly brief periods of time here in the Northeast between heating and cooling seasons (or vice versa). I am, however, going to co-op the term to also apply to the time when the Admissions office isn’t quite finished working with the current crop of graduating seniors but is also engaged with the the next group of rising seniors (and other underclass students) who are anxious to get a start on the college exploration process. For that later group I have a little treat… OK, that might be a bit of an exaggeration. I don’t know that it is remotely treat like, even though it has pretty effectively compiled my best advice over the years into an easily digestible and utterly listenable 51 minutes.Recently, I had the privilege and pleasure of sitting down with Dr. John Durante, a parent, educator, author, and host of the College Admissions Process Podcast. We had a great conversation about MIT, our selection process and how we are thinking about changes on the horizon of the college admissions landscape. It is definitely worth checking out, if I don’t say so myself.

I will point out that the podcast episode that I appear in is #297, so there are many, many other great discussions that one could also explore.  If you go all that way back to episode #260 from October 28, 2024, you can even hear from one of MIT’s former Director of Admissions extolling the virtues of the Liberal Arts.

MIT is a jock school,Emiko P. '25,8,2025-05-11T00:00:00-04:00,"As MIT Admissions’ one and only “jockblogger,” I have decided it’s my task—no, my duty—to finally say what needs to be said: MIT is a jock school.

Yes, that MIT. The one that has swept the Putnam competition for the last five years, the one with lunar rovers and Nobel Laureates and famously nerdy culture.

But also: the MIT where 25% of the undergraduates participate in one of the 33 varsity sports. The MIT where, underneath all the academic success, lurks an astounding amount of athletic success.

Let me prove it to you.

Dominating our Conference

MIT is the most successful school in our conference, the NEWMAC, with 199 conference titles. And just to be clear, this isn’t one team carrying everyone else on their back, but success across the board.

- Every MIT team in the NEWMAC has won a conference championship

- Men’s cross country has won every single NEWMAC championship since the conference was founded in 1998

- Men’s tennis has won 24

- Women’s track and field has won 15 

- Women’s and men’s swim and dive have won the past 14 conference championships straight

- Women’s tennis: 14

- Women’s soccer: 10

- Women’s volleyball: 9

- This past weekend, I watched women’s lacrosse destroy Babson (ranked 14th in the country) by 10 goals to win their second NEWMAC championship

Take that in: your MIT friends on sports teams are part of some pretty phenomenal programs with a long history of being a feared team in the NEWMAC. I’m sure the friends and families of these other NEWMAC schools often scoff and say, “Why are you so afraid of MIT? Those nerds? There’s no way they can play sports!” And I bet these NEWMAC athletes are so very tired of that being everyone’s response, because some of them literally dread playing MIT every year—because they know the truth: that MIT is a jock school. They know that these nerds are faster, stronger, and grittier than they are. They know that these beavers can bite. 

Competitive at a National Level

And while the NEWMAC demonstrates success at a regional scale, you might be thinking: Surely there is not this much success at a national level, too? 

WRONG! 

The limits of MIT athletics cannot simply be bound to the regional level. 

- MIT has won 5 team national championships in the past 3 years: men’s track and cross country (2022, 2023), women’s track and cross country (2024, 2025), women’s swim and dive (2025)

- We have won 71 individual national championships 

- At least 
        seven
      
 teams were ranked in the top 10 nationally this year

Awards (so many awards)

To me, the coolest stat about MIT athletics is this: we have more Academic All-Americans than anyone in the country. With 444 honorees as of August 2024, MIT dominates the lead, outpacing schools like Stanford, Notre Dame, and Alabama. The Academic All-American award is one of the most prestigious awards that a student-athlete can receive—won by the likes of Caitlin Clark, Katie Ledecky, Patrick Mahomes, and Peyton Manning! 

Proof!

MIT also has 22 NCAA Elite 90 Award winners, which recognizes the student-athlete with the highest cumulative GPA who has reached the national championship level of the NCAA tournament. This is such a cool award to win, because it’s the epitome of brains and brawn. Contending for a national championship and having a 4.0 GPA? Now that’s a flex.

Conclusion

It’s not every day you see athletics like these. Even I, as a recruited soccer athlete, didn’t realize just how much of a powerhouse MIT was. But if you think about it, it makes sense. Students come to MIT for the greatest possible academic experience, and if you’re an elite athlete who also happens to be smart, the draw of an amazing academic school is too much to resist. MIT is a magnet, drawing all the academically motivated jocks straight to it. 

I learned that MIT was a jock school by living in it. I saw my friends winning nationally acclaimed awards; I saw my soccer teammate win the NCAA Woman of the Year award; I heard the other teams grumble as our soccer team swept the conference 11–0 this year; I saw my classmates pubbing their conference finals, and I saw the new shirts they would wear the following week with NEWMAC Champion spelled out in bright letters; I saw how girls in my sorority would leave for a weekend and return as national champions. 

I’ve learned through firsthand experiences that MIT is a jock school—but we’re past the point where that should surprise anyone. By now, MIT athletics has earned its reputation. When people step onto campus, they should know that they’re entering not only an academic powerhouse, but an athletic one as well. 

Let the truth be known from here on out: MIT is a jock school.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-170955-1-400x440.png

Dining Hall Alchemy,Andi Q. '25,5,2025-05-11T00:00:00-04:00,"One of the many things I love about MIT’s dining halls is that they are buffet-style, allowing you to get as much food as you want from several “stations” around the dining hall. Indeed, an easy way to level up your MIT dining experience is by experimenting with exotic food combinations across different stations. Although they are designed to be self-contained and you can get full meals from any single station, there’s nothing stopping you from getting food from several of them at once.

When I’m not in a rush, I find it helpful to do a quick scan of the entire dining hall first and think about what might go well together instead of immediately committing to the grill or 
        comfort
      
 station. In doing so, I’m often surprised by how much the salad bar has to offer. For example, the stir-fry station at Simmons only has a selection of 8-10 different vegetables (which is admittedly already a lot), but you can double that number using the salad bar.

Some easy combinations that my friends and I have enjoyed over the years are as follows:

- Chicken tenders [grill] + Romaine lettuce [salad bar] + Ranch dressing [salad bar] = Crispy chicken Caesar salad

- Chicken tenders [grill] + Hot buffalo sauce [salad bar] + Honey [salad bar] = Hot buffalo honey chicken tenders

- Chicken tenders [grill] + Waffle [dessert] = Chicken and waffles

- Bagel + Guacamole [salad bar; only on Tuesdays at Simmons] = Avocado toast

- Cheese pizza [pizza; only at Maseeh] + Chicken tikka masala [comfort; only at Maseeh] = Curry pizza

Mixing foods from the same station can result in surprising new combinations too. Here’s a simple cereal combo recipe I learned from my friend Amee S. ’25:

Strawberry French Toast Cereal

Ingredients

Yields: 1 bowl of above-average cereal

- 1/5 bowl Cinnamon Toast Crunch

- 4/5 bowl Strawberry Special K

Preparation

- Add half of the Strawberry Special K to an empty cereal bowl to form the first layer.

- Layer on the Cinnamon Toast Crunch on top.

- Layer on the rest of the Strawberry Special K.

- Pour your choice of liquid into the bowl and serve immediately with a side of fresh strawberries (assuming you’re early enough to breakfast that they haven’t run out yet).

Ridiculously elaborate sandwiches

One of the best things about New Vassar dining is that you can get custom-made and toasted sandwiches for lunch there. Although none of the other dining halls have a dedicated sandwich station, they usually have most of the ingredients you’d need for a sandwich scattered around the dining hall.

Taking the above mixing idea a step further, you can create some ridiculously elaborate sandwiches, such as the one in the recipe below (also suggested by Amee S. ’25):

Dunkin’ At Home

Ingredients

Yields: One sandwich that I have been told resembles something you can buy at the Dunkin’ in the student center

- 1 plain bagel, sliced in half

- 1 omelet, freshly made by Kem (the dining hall worker who works at Simmons in the mornings)

- 1 teaspoon butter

- 1 tablespoon cream cheese

- 1 teaspoon feta, crumbled

- 2 black olives, sliced

- Sriracha

Preparation

- Toast the bagel while Kem makes the omelet.

- Spread cream cheese on one bagel half, and butter on the other.

- On the bagel half with cream cheese, sprinkle feta and olive slices.

- Top with the omelet and the other bagel half.

- Serve with a drizzle of Sriracha to taste.

But if that’s too much work for you, here are some easier sandwich recipes my friends and I have used:

- Bagel + Tuna salad [salad bar] = Tuna mayo sandwich

- Croissant [dessert] + Boiled egg [salad bar] + Mayo [salad bar] + Mustard [salad bar] + Feta [salad bar] = Egg salad sandwich

- Cheese quesadilla [grill] + Veggie burger patty [grill] = Double-Stuf quesadilla

- Bagel + American cheese [grill] + Mustard [salad bar] = Sad college-student cheese sandwich

To toast my sandwiches, I often use the toaster ovens found in the lounges around Simmons. Note that this requires me to leave the dining hall, so I usually only do this if I get a to-go box (e.g., during late-night dining where that’s the only option).

Drink mixes

Of course, I can’t include “alchemy” in the title of this post without mentioning drink mixes! The mix-every-drink-in-the-dining-hall drink is a classic, but here are a few more… sophisticated options I enjoy:

- 70% passion fruit-orange-guava juice + 20% orange juice + 10% apple juice + Splash of cranberry juice for color = Fruit cocktail

- 50% plain soda water + 50% your choice of fruit juice = Fruit soda

- Root beer + 1 scoop vanilla ice cream = Root beer float

- Chinese breakfast tea + Milk = 
        Boba tea minus the tapioca pearls
      


- Coffee + Chocolate milk = Mocha

- Water + Splash of red Gatorade = 
        Pink water
      


- 50% orange juice + 50% coffee = 
        Orange Joe
      


Where is this going

While writing this post, Amee S. ’25 suggested yet another… recipe(?) to include. It’s so ridiculous yet simultaneously brilliant, so I couldn’t possibly leave it out.

Squirrel Friendship Potion

Ingredients

Yields: 1 to 3 new squirrel friends

- 1 apple

Preparation

- Take the apple from your choice of dining hall.

- Ride the Red Line to Boston Commons.

- Find a squirrel that doesn’t look like it bites.

- Cut the apple into small cubes, and serve from a distance to your new squirrel friend.

Dining hall atrocities

The dining halls like to experiment with… interesting food combinations too! Here are a few particularly egregious examples I’ve experienced:

- One time, New Vassar had “pizza bagels” during dinner. I excitedly bit into a pepperoni pizza bagel… only to find out they had used stale cinnamon-raisin bagels.

- Another time, Simmons had “maple-glazed tofu” during dinner. Imagine my disappointment when I entered the dining hall only to see raw tofu blocks floating in a large bowl of plain maple syrup.

- Finally, there’s whatever these were meant to be:

(To be clear, these images were just display glitches on the menu, but I wouldn’t be too surprised if these did actually end up in the dining hall.)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.42.38-1-400x533.jpeg

SHE CAMPUS ON MY PREVIEW TIL I WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Angie F. '28,13,2025-05-06T00:00:00-04:00,"My Campus Preview Weekend (MIT’s admitted students weekend, also known as CPW) was a whirlwind of constant adventure. What I wouldn’t have guessed was that the first CPW I’d spend as an actual student would be pretty much the same: after all, flowers were finally starting to bloom en masse in Cambridge, and the prefrosh excitement around me was so palpable it was hard not to forget that I had psets for a couple of days. Here’s some of what I got up to!

 

Name \(2^n\) Women: Dorm culture is quite important at MIT: you can choose how much you do or don’t participate in it, but it’ll always be there if you want your social life to be centralized where you live, as many do. As a result, every dorm hosts their own CPW events to give incoming students a taste of their unique brand of MIT living. My dorm for next semester (and probably all the ones that follow it) East Campus (EC), is currently closed for renovations, but we still had an incredibly large and vibrant selection of events. This was one of them, and my friend Brianna and I got to co-run it. Our original goal for the event was to see which prefrosh could name the most women: participants would be given 30 seconds to list off as many women as they could. Those who fell below a certain threshold would have to eat a sardine (a punishment inspired by our good friend Ben, who loves sardines and making other people eat them), but anyone who managed to rise to the occasion and name a sufficient number of women would be rewarded with Insomnia cookies. However, we both had a 
        6.1200
      
 midterm that ended at the event start time, so when I got there after an extra slow defeated walk through the tunnels (6.1200 is arguably the class I’m worst at), it became clear to me that our friends who we’d asked to help us get the event started had had different ideas. We ended up working together to write down the names of as many distinct women as we could on the classroom’s massive blackboards, reaching a whooping \(2^9\) (coincidentally as many dumplings as we made at \(2^n\) dumplings over IAP). Admittedly, the event ended up being comprised of more excited upperclassmen than prefrosh, but it lifted me out of my post-midterm slump as I was reminded of one of my favorite parts of the EC community: its ability to turn any ridiculous idea into a bright and big reality, to commit to even the stupidest bit. 

2^9 women

Meet the Bloggers: This was so much fun! All the bloggers got together to hang out with prospective students and answer questions about blogging and MIT life. I remember wanting to attend this event so badly during my CPW but getting caught up in something else, so I’m glad I got to see what it was like from the other side. My main motivation to apply to write for the blog was to help show prospective students that MIT could be a place for them, too, and meeting some of these people in real life made me very, very happy. I talked to TALL BOY AND SHORT GIRL (I told you guys to keep an eye out on the blogs) and ate some really good pie of the meat and non-meat variety. What more could you ask for?

 

Underwater Battlebots: I helped run this event for Arcturus, MIT’s autonomous robotics team! While I unfortunately had to leave this iteration of Underwater Battlebots early to help with another event, I’d led the event in full for Splash, a program that allows MIT students to run a class on whatever they want for middle and high schoolers, and can therefore still write about it: kids divide into teams and receive a SeaPerch kit, which gives them everything they need to run an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. After an hour of building, they compete in a bracket-style Battlebots competition in the test tank at Sea Grant, the lab that Arcturus does most of their work in. Each team has two minutes to push rubber ducks and floating rings into their endzone, keep floating lily pads out, and pop the balloons in the other team’s endzone; additionally, catching a toy fish that swims through the pool gives you ten points (all other objects have absolute point values less than or equal to three). At the end, the points from the objects in each endzone are tallied up, and the winning team continues on in the bracket. It’s a whole lot of fun, and a great introduction to ocean engineering. I currently run outreach for Arcturus, but have had so much fun with it that I’ll most likely be joining the autonomy subteam this coming fall :) I’d encourage any prefrosh interested in building cool stuff to check them out! 

(Additionally, I feel compelled to mention that East Campus is arguably the most build-y living group on campus, since I’ve been talking about them all blog post but haven’t had an opportunity to share this essential [and, in my opinion, very cool] part of the dorm’s culture. For example, here’s an old EC build one of my hallmates found yesterday: an elaborate dorm room automation system featuring a security system, a touch screen command center [keep in mind that this was way before iPads were a thing], automatic blind and door controls, and… a party mode? We also build a fort and a rollercoaster for all of campus to enjoy every year before the start of fall semester. Whether you’re looking for hands to help you build anything you can think of or ears to listen to you talk about it, you’ll find no shortage of them in East Campus.)

CryoFAC: When I remember my CPW, I think about long days spent running back and forth through campus and across the bridge, the sunrise peeking through my blinds as I got ready for bed, a million gazillion introductions, too much free food and boba to count, lock-picking, the occasional sunny moment on Killian (
        CPW weather machine was out of order for my year
      
)… and, of course, liquid nitrogen ice cream on Kresge lawn. What I didn’t know back then was that the event that filled me with the prefrosh giddiness I’d get every time I was faced with something that seemed so quintessentially MIT was CryoFAC, which has been run by East Campus for 23 years and counting, which meant that I’d eventually help run it myself. We prepared the batter beforehand (I made two batches of butter pecan, and 32 batches of vanilla!), then prepared the ice cream on the spot for prefrosh by pouring liquid nitrogen into the batter-filled bowl and mixing as quickly as possible. One of the most important parts of CryoFAC has nothing to do with the ice cream at all: every year, East Campus chooses a 
        freshman
      
 to be Box Boy, who runs around in a box trying to bring people to the event. We also had some very talented friends DJing, which made it very easy to lock in on mixing ice cream for two straight hours on two straight days.

Overall, this might have been my favorite event. I spent my CPW walking around campus bewildered: I’d gone to visit for HMMT before, but this was my first time feeling the real MIT, the rhythm pulsing through the heart of the campus, the first whiffs of the patterns I’d eventually know like the back of my hand. Every time I met a group of upperclassmen friends who freely offered up solid advice and told us about their hopes and dreams with laser sharp clarity, peeked into a lecture hall and saw a professor writing what might as well have been gibberish on the board, blinked through dozens of events that would’ve been the most exciting things I’d done all month at home but were just one of countless crazy beautiful adventures here, all I’d feel was this longing to enter the world I’d been swept into. As small a part of my CPW as it was, the liquid nitrogen ice cream stayed in my mind because of this: MIT seemed like this impossible place where anything could happen, and the fact that such a silly, awesome thing that had definitely just once been a few students’ late night idea was so real and right in front of my face was proof of that. Being on the other side of the table in my bright orange jumpsuit reminded me of how magical this place was to me during that weekend in my senior year of high school, and how I’d finally carved a place out in that magic for myself.

Stay Woke Rave: Finally, my CPW ended with East Campus’ STAY WOKE RAVE! As the automatic party mode might have given away, lots of people in East Campus love DJing and dancing all night long. I myself am no exception (I’m taking a class to learn how to DJ next semester!). My friends Dylan, James, and Niko each DJed a set while the rest of us danced. At the few parties I went to in high school, no one really danced, and this was disappointingly true for some of the ones I attended at college too. Which makes sense, I guess: lots of my friends who I’d talked to about it were too nervous about “doing it wrong” to try it even if they’d wanted to. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case at East Campus, not just for dancing but for everything else: it’s easy for me to feel welcome to try new things and do badly at them around my EC friends. Being in this kind of environment mean that it wasn’t uncommon for me to dance with just one or two friends and have an amazing time, so being in such a comparatively large crowd with such good music was exhilarating…. 

…maybe a little too exhilarating, actually. During Niko’s set, I felt my foot land awkwardly on the ground and fell. My friends helped me get to a bench outside, where I realized that I’d twisted my ankle. I ended up covered in sweat and holding a soda bottle to my swollen foot as my other one tapped impatiently on the ground: I wasn’t very convinced I’d twisted it too hard and was pretty miffed about being off the dance floor for the rest of the night. My friends had come out to sit with me, but I’d fairly quickly sent them back to the party since I didn’t want them to miss out on my behalf, leaving me all alone. Eventually, I heard footsteps and looked up to see my friend Will. We locked eyes and he didn’t say a word, just pushed a cart he’d rolled out from the party room over at me. A smile broke out across my face. 

I hoisted myself onto the cart and laughed my way back to the room, where I was able to keep dancing with my friends as I got rolled around. Soon, Niko’s set came to an end and the lights came back on, giving everyone a full view of my ankle. As the last partygoers gaped in shock, I finally admitted to myself that okay, maybe I had twisted it a little. I couldn’t put any weight on it, but thankfully, someone found a wheelbarrow in the corner of the room, and I was carted all the way to my friends’ suite in Burton Conner, which I decided would be a safer place to stay than my single in case I still couldn’t walk when I woke up. But I was sure I’d be able to sleep it off. The next day came around and I had not, in fact, slept it off. I half-Ubered half-hopped to MIT Health (after rejecting my friends’ many offers for help getting there #woops) and they told me it was probably fractured, but the x-ray revealed that it was only badly sprained! Woohoo! That evening, I crutched over to Baker dining and was welcomed with a round of applause from my East Campus friends, who deemed me “EC’s strongest soldier.” If you see me hobbling around campus in one of those big boots and an EC shirt, just know that I have no regrets.

got too silly

One of my favorite memories from the two weekends I spent at MIT for 
        Sin LiMITe
      
 and CPW was sitting in a booth at Cambridge Pizza (which would eventually become my most frequented late night food spot, a favorite place to wrap up evenings of adventures with friends) in an overly fancy dress with some upperclassmen, rapt as they gave me advice and I hung onto their every word. Looking from the outside in (and even from the inside in sometimes), MIT can seem like a scary place, but I’ve always been able to hold onto the sense of comfort that night gave me. There have been people looking out for me from the beginning, so how could it not all turn out okay? I’m glad to have been able to play so many roles during CPW and be a first MIT memory for so many people, especially since I look back on mine so fondly. To every prefrosh I did and did not meet: the best is yet to come.

sophomore accumulations,Veronica P. '27,3,2025-05-06T00:00:00-04:00,"This week, as classes began to die down, I told a friend: “the only thing I gained this year was academic hardship.” Sophomore year tends to be the year when things ‘get real’, at least as a Mech-e, and I found myself working harder than I ever have to keep up.

But there’s much more to your second year than the “sophomore slump”, and certainly much more that I’ve gotten out of these past two semesters. I don’t really feel like rambling on about what I’ve learned (nor do I think I’ve narrowed it down quite yet). What I do feel like doing, though, is sharing few of the experiences/possessions i’m happy to have gathered :)

Thinking Outside of Absolutes,Richard O. '28,4,2025-04-30T00:00:00-04:00,"For a while now, I’ve had this realization that I tend to overthink a lot. And I think this is something a lot of people can relate to. There are always moments when you’re presented with a decision, and naturally, you want to make a choice that leads to the least regret. So, how else do you ensure you make the best choice? You think about it. You imagine yourself in different worlds and try to predict the outcome based on the choices you make. You then make a choice. If that choice turns out as you expect, you may be satisfied. If it doesn’t, you may not be satisfied and regret not making another choice because you may feel you didn’t pay attention to the details. So then the next time around, you pay attention to more details. You learn from your mistakes and get better at making predictions for outcomes. But every time you consider more details, you do more thinking. 

 

In the past few months, I’ve found myself thinking about this loop of thinking in almost every interaction, conversation, assignment submission, and choice that I’ve made. And by thinking about this, I’ve started to realize that I tend to trap myself in this view of the world, where everything is absolute. A view of the world where I feel if I don’t make a specific choice when I think I need to make it, there will be a domino effect of consequences that I will regret later. And from this, I’ve found that I started to constrict myself to an imaginary list of instructions that I would need to follow in order to be sure I follow the best predictions from my decisions. (i.e., if I don’t finish this assignment now, then I can’t go to event A tomorrow, which will prevent me from doing event B, which will have some other consequence C, and so on). Even as I write this blog, I question how different word choices and sentences I use will convey my thoughts to those who end up reading this, and whether that will have consequences on how my blog impacts those people, and so on. But in overthinking about overthinking (overthinking squared?), I’ve realized that thinking too much makes me forget about what it means to just appreciate everything.

 

Like the Alan Watts quote goes: 

“A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.” 

“A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.” 

 

For me, I’ve found that in trying to perfect everything about my day to day life, whether that be completing all my given tasks for a day or using the most expressive choice of words when having a conversation with someone, I forget that reality isn’t supposed to be like a Hollywood movie where every scene follows some cliche plot line or a math problem where everything is optimized. Sometimes, things happen that are meant to make your story different. Sometimes things happen that really do make life feel like a movie. But nothing is ever supposed to be “perfect”. There are always going to be days when things will simply not go as planned. Or days where things will feel overwhelming. Or days where it feels like things are just moving too fast. But having these days doesn’t make your life any less beautiful than it already is. 

 

So, taking all this, I’ve started to think about approaching everything I think about differently. Instead of imagining the world like some binary machine that only prints out “success” or “regret” every time I make a choice, I’ve found it much more useful to imagine the world like a story generator. Every choice acts like a prompt for a new plot. These stories depend on each other, but no story itself is the whole story. It just keeps on going. Bringing new twists and turns based on our choices. And using this perspective, it then becomes easy for me to recognize why I tend to overthink a lot – and it’s because I’m always afraid that one of these prompts will send the story generator downhill and take it to a point where no new prompt I make will produce a story where I feel successful. But this view depends on the assumption that the story generator is absolute – i.e., the story generator generates ALL possible stories – but it can’t. Because the world is so vast and unpredictable, there are always opportunities for us to find ways to change our stories.

 

So, all of this to say, I feel it’s important to remember that life is not absolute. It’s dynamic. It’s beautiful. It’s unpredictable. It’s crazy. It’s amusing. And it’s always changing. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with thinking deeply about your choices and decisions, but I think, for me, the notion that my decisions in every moment of every day are the final deciders for the future was something that I needed to think about differently. Nothing that happens now will restrict what you can change later because people always have the ability to learn and do new things. And I feel recognizing that we also have this ability to think outside of absolutes is something that can really help you to appreciate the ups and downs and in betweens of life for making us the people that we are.

Behind the Scenes of MIT Gala,Gloria Z. '26,1,2025-04-27T00:00:00-04:00,"Over the past three years, I’ve been on the organizing board for MIT Gala, our student-run fashion show! Originally conceptualized in 2023 as the launch event for Infinite Magazine, the annual event has since spun out into something much larger, including a student arts showcase, live music, and of course the titular runway show. Planning MIT Gala is a yearlong effort, culminating in one joyful night of celebrating art and design at MIT. In fact–today’s the day of Gala 2025: April 27th! Setup begins at 8AM, and the event starts at 5PM, so come with me as we go behind the scenes to see how a fashion show is made.

!!

(Before we begin–this is the amazing team getting it done: sophia, aimee, layla, pria, mich, vieyiti, jessica, selena, sophie, lindsay, julia, maggie, michelle, eliana, joanne, andy, & me!)

9:30AM – In the student center, Mich is in the midst of running the first of three modeling workshops for everyone that will be walking the runway today. I stop by to say hi and snap a couple pics. All the models are dressed in all black, learning how to walk on beat and pose and turn.

slaying

10AM – Over at the Media Lab, where MIT Gala will be held on the 6th floor, set design (Maggie + Julia + Lindsay) is hard at work setting up the runway with a border of iridescent fabric and string lights. The rest of the team is putting down tablecloths, working out logistics, and setting up the AV system. An Area 4 coffee/breakfast order is also in the works…

10:30AM – Laptop Ensemble, who will be performing the music for the runway portion of Gala, is starting to set up their equipment and test the audio system, armed with an impressive array of synths, cables, and Cool Looking Audio Gear. E33—who will be doing all the lighting—has also just arrived with a cart full of expensive looking projection lights, black boxes of Technical Stuff, and even thicker cables. In the meantime, I’m trying to figure out how the very intimidating AV box works…

11AM – Michelle is setting up the tripod to film the runway, and our breakfast order is here!!

12PM – Designers are filtering in to drop off their garments in the back room, and artists who are displaying things in the gallery are coming to install their work on the tables and walls. I have also finally acquired an HDMI cable, so I can start testing my projections, which will be on the walls in the background of the runway :D

12:30PM – MoDonk (a combination of members from two dance groups, Mocha Moves and Ridonkulous) have arrived to rehearse their dance, which they’ll perform right before the runway show. Laptop Ensemble is trying out every cable they own to try and get the audio to play from the 15+ speakers mounted on the ceiling.

1:30PM – Mich is overseeing the first runway walkthrough, making sure all the models are familiar with the runway route and how to walk in sync at 115 BPM. I’m testing my visuals on the walls :-)! After this walkthrough, all the models will be funneled to the rooms in the back for styling and fitting.

2:30PM – Makeup and hair are in full swing! The remainder of the set is also getting pieced together, including an improvised mylar barrier for the models to walk behind before getting on the runway.

3:45PM – waiting for the dress rehearsal at 4PM to start = time for minecraft longplay + zzz



4:15PM – Setting up the photo booth and the gallery, running through the dress rehearsal, and jazz ensemble unpacking all their instruments!

Aand doors open at 5! This’ll be the last update of tonight—I’ll be back after the event with all the nice photos and a recap. Thanks for coming along :))","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/texture_4_5_instagram_size-400x500.png

Every class I’ve taken at MIT,Emiko P. '25,7,2025-04-26T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m doing exactly what the title says: ranking 
        every class
      
 I’ve ever taken at MIT! Feel free to scroll through and take a look at my class tier list, some stats, and my four-year roadmap of classes :)

Classes tier list

Disclaimer: I am well aware that I have some hot takes here. Some classes that people generally dislike are ranked highly here because I have fond memories and learned a lot from them. Some classes that others liked are at the very bottom. It really depends on the person, but to have some semblance of structure, I loosely based my ranking off of these definitions:

- S: best class ever

- A: would take again and again

- B: enjoyed

- C: meh, that was a class

- D: disliked

- F: should be deleted from course catalog

every class i’ve ever taken at MIT, ranked!

I’ll explain the reasoning for these rankings below in my four-year class roadmap! (Also, I clearly couldn’t bear to put anything in the F tier lol. That’s mean)

 

My four-year class roadmap

FRESHMAN FALL

Calculus I/II Accelerated (18.01A/18.02A) → Rank B

This class was an accelerated version of Calc 1 and 2, cramming the classes into a semester + IAP. Things I remember really well: staying up until 3 am finishing a PSET with 15 other kids stuffed in a New Vassar study room, being on campus during my first snowy Boston IAP, sitting in the back three rows of 26-100 with the soccer girls and the football team. Things I don’t remember as much: calculus.

Physics I (8.01) → Rank B

A General Institute Requirement (GIR). Made the mistake of taking this class at 9 am. Often fell asleep during virtual Friday Problem Solving.

Principles of Chemical Science (5.111) → Rank D

Another GIR. I’m just not the biggest fan of chemistry.

Becoming Human: Ancient Perspectives on the Good Life (CC.110) → Rank C

This was a philosophy class in the freshman year learning community Concourse, which is a community for students with an interest in the blend of STEM and humanities.

Comments on this semester: Freshman fall was Pass No Record—I was playing college sports for the first time, had just joined my sorority, and was getting to know Bawston. 

FRESHMAN SPRING

Introduction to CS and Programming using Python (6.100L) → Rank A

This is the extended, full-semester version of the intro Python coding class that usually takes half a semester. I had never coded before, but being surrounded by code wizard classmates inspired me, and this ended up being the singular most useful class I ever took at MIT! 

Introduction to Psychology (9.00) → Rank C

At this time, I was pretty sure I’d be a Course 9. However, this class was virtual that semester, so I ended up pretty unengaged with 9.00.

Physics II (8.02) → Rank D

I took the Concourse version of this class, and I found it so hard for some reason?!? I like physics, but found it pretty tough to wrap my head around electricity and magnetism the way it was explained in this class.

Spanish IV (21G.704) → Rank B

You may think technical classes at MIT are tough, but just wait until you take a language class. You meet four days a week, and there’s homework every day. But that means you learn a lot! I love languages, and I tested into Spanish 4 because of my AP scores in high school. It was also a MISTI requirement, because I would be going to Spain that summer!

Comments on this semester: I declared Brain and Cognitive Science (Course 9) as my major at the end of this semester, then went to Madrid to do computational neuroscience research about emotions! I abruptly switched my major that summer because I didn’t enjoy my research very much. Here is a blog about that whole thought process. I was having the very scary thought that “what if I come to MIT and never create anything?” So, I declared Course 2.

SOPHOMORE FALL

Inventing the Samurai (21G.554) → Rank B

Pre-Meiji Restoration early Japanese history class. My family in Japan was a samurai family, so this was so cool to learn about. 

Differential Equations (18.03) → Rank C

Chill class in terms of grading, but I didn’t absorb the content long-term.

Mechanics and Materials I (2.001) → Rank D

I found myself struggling to care in this class. The way beams bend and materials stretch are interesting on the surface, but in practice I was just pretty bored. Also, I bombed the tests haha. I’m just not the best test-taker. However, I hope this shows you that even if you don’t like some of your introductory classes for your major, you can still love the major itself!!!!

Intro to Design (2.00) → Rank A

This class was the one that made me really excited about mechanical engineering! We had a building competition that was Avatar the Last Airbender themed, where we had to find a way to knock down 15-foot-tall “firebenders” (aka helium-inflated balloons) with only a few specific materials. My team ended up building a 17-foot-tall structure (named Appa) out of foam core, and we won the competition! Woohooo! 

Numerical Computation for Mechanical Engineers (2.086) → Rank B

MATLAB and numerical analysis class. They don’t really teach you to code in this class, so I would definitely come in with some type of coding experience (even if it’s not MATLAB—shout out 6.100L!!!). Doing these PSETs were soooo satisfying. 

Comments on this semester: This is the semester that I realized “ok, phew, I like Course 2!”

SOPHOMORE SPRING

Thermofluids Engineering I (2.005) → Rank S

I LOVED THIS CLASS. ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLASSES EVER. (also the only class I’ve ever had to PNR lol… the grading was pretty strict) Learning how the world works—and that there is a logical reason for most things—is mind blowing. Air conditioners. Refrigerators. Engines. Body heat. 

21G.504 (Japanese 4) → Rank B

I tested into Japanese 4, and I made Japanese my humanities concentration. I highly recommend taking language classes at MIT—while they’re definitely a good amount of work, imagine being fluent in another language after only four semesters?!?! Why not?? Learn that language you’ve always been interested in!

Design and Manufacturing I (2.007) → Rank S

Such a fulfilling class. Over the course of a semester, you build your very own robot and then compete against your classmates. The two weeks before the competition, I probably spent 40 hours per week in Pappalardo, but get this: I wanted to be there and it was FUN. I went from not knowing how to properly handle a drill or lathe to winning the MacGyver Prize for creativity in that class! Woohoo! 

Electronics for Mechanical Systems I (2.678) → Rank B

An intro, super high-level electronics class. At the end of the class, I got to program a line following robot with my roommate. Our robot was really fast (especially when it would nearly drive off the competition board!).

Comments about the semester: I felt my confidence as an engineer growing, and I was instilled with enough confidence to feel like I could contribute to my engineering internship in Tokyo. 

JUNIOR FALL

Dynamics and Controls I (2.003) → Rank D

This was a tough semester for me, especially because I broke my foot and couldn’t play soccer all season. I didn’t put much effort into this class, focusing more on my two other project classes.

Global Engineer (2.76) → Rank C

Built a prototype of a highway litter cleaner for a major vehicle manufacturing company. It was a cool project, but I didn’t have the engineering skills yet to contribute as much as I wanted to. It inspired me to want to learn how to CAD more proficiently, which led me to doing a product design internship the next summer. 

Science Writing and New Media (21W.035) → Rank B

This was a specific type of class called a CI-H, which usually only freshmen and sophomores take (but I hadn’t taken enough CI-H classes, and I was getting angry emails from MIT about it oopsie). I ended up in a class of all freshmen, and every class was so lively and borderline rambunctious that I couldn’t help but enjoy it.

D-Lab: Design for Scale (2.279) → Rank C

D-Lab! Built a prototype of a portable asthma diagnosis device for use in rural India. It was empowering to build a product with the sole purpose of helping others.

Comments on this semester: This semester was definitely my lowest in terms of tier-ranked classes. I bet there’s some association with the fact that I was sad about not being able to play soccer because of my injury. I enjoyed the classes, but I don’t look back on them with the same fondness as others.

JUNIOR SPRING

Dynamics and Controls II (2.004) → Rank A

Because I kind of slacked off in 2.003 the previous semester, I was eager to dive back into learning. I really poured my heart into this class—which made it one of my favorite classes! Funny how effort and enjoyment seem to correlate… 

Measurement & Instrumentation (2.671) → Rank A

This one might be a hot take, but I really liked this class. I wrote a blog about it here!

Design and Manufacturing II (2.008) → Rank D

With a team of five, we designed and manufactured 50 Snapple-themed yo-yos. We learned Fusion360, manufacturing simulations, CNC, injection molding, thermoforming, insert molding. I just realized I’m not the biggest fan of manufacturing.

Drawing for Designers (21M.601) → Rank D

This class was a three-hour drawing session on Wednesday nights. I took this class to learn how to draw better for my product design internship that summer. I swear everyone in that class was literally Leonardo DaVinci… besides me. But that’s ok! At the very least, I definitely improved!!

Comments on this semester: I was collecting more and more engineering skills (drawing, CAD, manufacturing). I was excited to put them all together at my product design internship.

SENIOR FALL

Product Design Process (2.009) → Rank S

S tier. For sure. My team was awesome—driven to make a product that helped people and just fun to be around. I wrote a blog about this super cool experience.

Intro Bio (7.014) → Rank C

Bio is the final GIR that I had to take, which I’d been putting off since freshman year. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the approach of the teaching staff, who wanted us to learn something useful from the class even if we weren’t planning on becoming biologists. It was also nice to learn something technical yet completely unrelated to mechanical engineering for the first time in a while.

Japanese 5 (21G.505) → Rank A

Unlike Japanese 4, which focused more on grammar, this class focused on culture and conversation. It was refreshing to get to speak freely, especially about cultural things I related to (like food and specific Japanese mannerisms). I wrote this blog about how I romanticized this class.

Intro/Advanced Satellite Engineering (16.851/16.853) → Rank S

Alright, people, LISTEN UP! If you are interested in aerospace at all, but are not majoring in it, TAKE THIS CLASS! It gives you a crash course in so many topics: the rocket equations, power, communication, data-handling, the space environment, orbital mechanics, etc. Also, it’s taught by two incredibly engaging Course 16 professors: Prof. Kerri Cahoy and Prof. Oli de Weck.

Comments on this semester: I loved this semester. My classes were interesting and diverse, and every day there was something new to gush about to anyone who would listen.

SENIOR SPRING

Introduction to Numerical Analysis (16.S090) → Rank B

I took this class because I’ve been interested in data analysis for a while, and I missed coding. It ended up being pretty similar to 2.086, but I liked chatting with the professor during office hours, and I used Jupyter Notebook for the first time which was so satisfying. Also, this was a half semester class!

Entrepreneurship 101 (15.390) → Rank B

My very first Sloan business class. It’s been inspiring to realize that you can make your own job. I also appreciate how this class has a disciplined way of approaching entrepreneurship—I knew before that great ideas aren’t simply pulled from thin air, but this class is teaching me strategies on how to actually pin down that great idea and grow it.

Writing Fantasy (21W.766) → Rank A

I. Love. This. Class. It focuses on long-form fantasy: aka writing fantasy novels. We get to write drafts of chapters for our own books, and I’ve loved reading what all my classmates have come up with. This class has inspired me to write the fantasy novel that’s been marinating in my imagination for a while now…

Electronics for Mechanical Systems II (2.679) → Rank A

For the first time, I get to work with circuit boards! I’m making a Tamagotchi for my final product and the process of designing my own circuit board has taught me so much. I now feel like I can make so many little projects! I love collecting new technical skills!

Comments on this semester: Well, there’s three weeks left in this semester, so it’s not quite over yet. I’m excited to keep working on my Tamagotchi project, and I’ve loved how much I’ve gotten to write over these past few weeks!

Final thoughts!

It’s kind of crazy that I can summarize my four years of MIT classes into a single blog now. To make this blog, I went on Hydrant, which is a planning site for MIT classes so you can play around with your schedule. As I scrolled, I realized that I hadn’t been on this site for a while—probably because I won’t ever need to use it again.

I’m done choosing MIT undergrad classes. This is it—there is no more “what are you taking next semester?” It’s a little bittersweet, as many things are when you’re a senior with a month left until graduation.

But also making this blog has felt awesome. I feel accomplished; I feel proud! I feel lucky and grateful that I got to take these classes, and I can see just how much I’ve grown since I was a freshman, staring wide-eyed at the course catalog and overwhelmed by all the possibilities. Undergrad is cool. These classes are cool! Learning is so cool!!

I’m glad MIT is where I got to take four years of classes, and I hope learning never stops as I step beyond this place :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/generated_image-4-17-400x229.png

[Guest Post] STARS@MIT: A Year in Review,Nicole Cooper,2,2025-04-23T00:00:00-04:00,"We’ve been busy at the STARS College Network at MIT! This past year marked our second year as part of the consortium, and we’ve received a lot of great questions about the partnership—questions like: “What is STARS?” “What does MIT do as part of it?” and “How can it help me?”

Well, the short answer is: we’ve been doing a lot! So we asked Claire, one of our STARS (Small-Town and Rural Student) Ambassadors, to give you a quick recap of everything we’ve been up to this past year.

Spoiler alert: it’s been a big year. Check it out!

STARS@MIT: A Year in ReviewWhen I was applying to college, I sometimes felt like I didn’t have people to turn to for advice in my small town. That’s why I’m so excited to share what STARS@MIT and the STARS Ambassadors—current college students from small-town and rural areas—have been doing to support rural high schoolers exploring their college options. These ambassadors serve to complement MIT’s partnership with the STARS College Network, a network of 32 colleges across the U.S. with programs tailored specifically for small-town and rural students. As a STARS Ambassador myself, I can confirm that we’ve been really busy over this last year, brainstorming ways we could give rural students the resources we wish we’d had when applying to college and deciding on the right fit for us. So as we wrap up our first full academic year of programming, here’s a year in review of what STARS Ambassadors at MIT have been up to—and what’s still ahead! WebinarsSTARS@MIT hosts several webinars, run by both admissions officers and STARS Ambassadors. So far, topics have included applying to college as a rural student and what to expect if you decide to go to college far from home or in a big city. The end of each session leaves time for participants to ask questions, so if you have any questions you want to ask live, this is your chance! We also use these webinars to dispel some common misconceptions when it comes to top colleges. These include the concerns that a top college would be too expensive (not true—financial aid can be very generous!) or that if you didn’t win Math Olympiad, you’re not who these colleges are looking for (also not true—admissions officers consider your application within the context of your environment, and they’re looking for people from a range of backgrounds because they understand the value rural students bring).Our next webinar is May 14, 2025 at 7pm EDT, where we’ll be talking about navigating the transition from a small town to a big city for college. You can find this event, along with all our upcoming offerings, at this link. We hope to see you there!Fly-In ProgramsThis past year, we hosted two separate fly-in events—one for rural and small-town high school counselors and another for rural and small-town high school students.MIT co-hosted STARS’ inaugural Northeast Counselor Conference along with Yale University, Brown University, Colby College, and Columbia University in the City of New York. During the program, counselors traveled between Yale, Brown and MIT (host universities) along with representatives from those universities with support from Columbia University and Colby College. Counselors went on campus tours, interacted with student ambassadors during Q&A panels, and participated in case studies with admissions officers to learn more about the college admission process and how they can support their students back home. The program aimed to show counselors the environment each university provides and what these universities look for in applications, so the counselors could then return to their respective rural and small-town high schools and more effectively guide students toward the right universities for them.In addition to the counselor fly-in, STARS@MIT also hosted a fly-in program for rural and small-town high school juniors. Unlike the counselor fly-in, however, the student fly-in was hosted solely by MIT (although several colleges who participate in STARS host their own version of this student fly-in). Visiting students stayed in the dorms with current students and experienced three days packed with activities. I won’t go too in-depth about the student fly-in because Vaneeza R. ’25, another STARS Ambassador, has already written a great blog post about it. You can read all about it here.  And if you’re from a small town and going to be a high school junior for the 2025-2026 school year, watch our events page (linked at the bottom of this post) for when the fly-in application opens in June. Students from across the US visiting MIT during our first-ever STARS student fly-in!Virtual College FairEvery semester, all of STARS’ partner colleges get together to host a virtual college fair for rural and small-town students. This is a space for students to learn more about these colleges, plus get any questions they have answered. While you’re always welcome to reach out to colleges individually, this is a unique opportunity because it brings 32 colleges across the country together in one place.But what exactly should you be doing at a college fair? Good question—I never had a college fair in my town, either. The only things I knew about them came from movies or TV shows. But unlike what I saw on the screen, college fairs are not meant to be stressful. They’re meant for learning. You’re not being judged by the admissions officers based on how well you pitch yourself (you don’t need to be pitching yourself at all!!). This is your time to learn about colleges, and the admissions officers are the ones pitching their colleges to you! If you want to take full advantage of a STARS virtual college fair, look into the universities beforehand and come into the event with an idea of the institutions you are excited about and what qualities matter to you in a college, then figure out which colleges you’re interested in have those qualities. But if you’re not at the stage where you know what colleges you’re interested in or what matters to you in a college, that’s also okay. This time is also for exploring places you may not have otherwise considered. Use the college fair to help answer those questions, or see if the admissions officers can direct you to more resources to help you figure that out. Wherever you are in the college application process, from having no idea where to start to knowing exactly where you want to apply, STARS virtual college fairs are open to you.This upcoming college fair, MIT will have both admissions officers and STARS Ambassadors (current students) available to answer any questions you might have.Outreach TripsWhile not something STARS Ambassadors participate in (unfortunately we do have classes to go to), admissions officers at MIT often join other colleges in the STARS Network to travel across the country and meet students in rural areas! This is through the STORY (Small-Town Outreach Recruitment and Yield) program and STARS outreach travel. Want to see if STARS is visiting a town near you? Hop on the STARS College Network events page to see what visits are coming up next! Here’s a really cool blog post from our STARS program coordinator and MIT’s Assistant Director of Admissions for Rural Outreach, Nikki, about one of the STORY trips she took.Welcoming Admitted StudentsAll of the programming mentioned so far has been directed toward rural students applying to college, but what about students who have actually been admitted to college? Our STARS Ambassadors are also hard at work to make sure these admits feel welcome. This support starts from the moment students find out they’ve been admitted to MIT all the way to the day they commit to a college. This academic year, we wrote individual postcards to admitted rural and small-town students, hosted a virtual celebration for them (and one for their parents!), and even ran an in-person event during Campus Preview Weekend (CPW) where STARS adMITS could connect with new and current students from similar backgrounds. The transition to a new environment can be difficult, especially if you don’t feel like it’s an experience shared by your peers, so our goal is to provide a community for rural and small-town students at MIT to feel like they’re heard and understood.Some of our STARS Ambassadors (plus Nikki, our coordinator!) after an evening of Just Dance at our event for admitted rural students at CPW. STARS@MIT Email InboxDo you have questions that aren’t answered in our programming? Or maybe you just want to have a conversation with someone who’s been through similar experiences to you? We run an email address, starsprogram@mit.edu, that we encourage you to reach out to with STARS-related questions. This includes admissions, experiences as a rural student at MIT, and even general advice. We have admissions officers and STARS Ambassadors waiting to answer your emails!Final Thoughts“Now Claire, this all sounds great, but how do I know if I qualify as a rural or small town student?” This is actually a question that comes up a lot. One misconception is that STARS defines “rural and small-town” based solely on National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data. But this isn’t necessarily true—each college actually makes their own decisions on who they consider rural and small-town based on many factors from population to your lived experience.  The reason for these differences is because we recognize what makes an area rural or small, is so complex. There is no map that can quantify the feeling of the environment you grew up in or the resources your school was able to provide. So as long as you identify as coming from a rural or small-town, most of our STARS programming is open to you! If you’re interested in a specific college, reach out to them directly and see if you fall under their definition of rural and small-town.Finally, while our STARS Ambassadors technically work for MIT, we’re not here to recruit as many rural students to MIT as possible—we’re here to help you find the right college for you. We recognize everyone has a different path, and we want to help you find that path and support you along your journey. To that end, we’re excited about the programs we were able to support this past year—but we’re also equally excited to see what the next academic year holds. To stay up-to-date on our programming, keep an eye on this page where we’ll be posting all our events. Our programs are continually evolving and expanding to be the best they can be, so we want to hear your thoughts on how we can best support you as a rural student looking into college. Please don’t hesitate to send an email to our inbox—we’d love to talk to you.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STARS-MIT-color-400x388.jpg

I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!!,Aiden H. '28,7,2025-04-20T00:00:00-04:00,"This coming Tuesday, the major declaration form is due for freshmen.

What follows is the very long and detailed crisis I had in picking my major, organized by what I considered, in a roughly chronological order:

Course 8 (Physics)

Okay I never seriously considered physics while at MIT, but in sophomore/junior/early senior year of high school, I told everyone that I was going to major in (astro)physics, which I don’t necessarily regret? I think I had a lot of fair reasoning behind thinking I wanted to major in physics–I’ve always loved math, and space has been my weird nerd thing since I was young and declared Neptune the greatest planet as I put the sticky stars on my ceiling.

Then I took AP Physics C: Mechanics and quickly realized that 
        I do not like physics at all.
      
 It was actively the worst I have ever felt about myself academically, and I learned that the learning curve and extensive background knowledge to go from general physics to anything astronomy-applied is far to great for me to care.

Nonetheless, I did apply to some schools as a physics major. Funnily enough, I didn’t apply to MIT as physics, and it was one of the “prestigious” schools that accepted me. It’s as if even the others knew that physics wasn’t for me lol.

Course 20 (Bioengineering)

Bioengineering was the other main track I shifted to after the physics-debacle. This also made a fair amount of sense and isn’t that random. I took AP Bio senior year and really liked it, and in middle school Bio was always my favorite/most-interested-in topic. Half of it was all the cute little cell drawings and fun words like “golgi apparatus”, but I think the upfront helping-others mission in all bio-adjacent fields has always resonated with me and something I could see myself doing that is at least a little noble and important.

I wasn’t super sold on the engineering part though. I’ve always seen myself as someone who is more interested in learning about things than making them, so engineering seemed like a long shot. I had no interest in medical technology in the same way that I have no interest in electronics or mechanical engineering–fields that feel very structurally similar to bioengineering. But knowing very well I wasn’t going to go pre-med or do a PhD, bioengineering felt more useful as a bachelors than pure bio.

Course 6-7 (Computer Science and Molecular Biology)

I remember sitting at a debate tournament in Colorado looking through all the MIT majors out of curiosity, when I stumbled upon the strange beauty that is 6-7. I instantly called people I knew to tell them I knew what I wanted to do. I felt like it would allow me to doing something in biology that isn’t 
        dissecting mice or using X-rays or whatever.
      
 And like that I thought I was fine!! Like I decided once and for all what I would do!

It is strongly appealing because it doesn’t have that I-will-spend-the-rest-of-my-life-rotting-under-the-fluorescent-lighting-of-a-lab feeling, but going most of my freshman year thinking about declaring 6-7, I was hit with an equally devastating feeling: I-will-spend-the-rest-of-my-life-straining-my-eyes-and-hunching-my-back-over-my-computer. I still heavily considered 6-7, but with more and more time to ruminate over the class list, I noticed I like the sound of the major a lot more than the work itself. I like the idea of using stats for biology more than I do actually sitting doing and coding the programs themselves. I like the sound of taking classes like “Intro to Algorithms” or “Machine Learning in Molecular and Cellular Biology” much more than I do actually doing any of those psets for hours on end with no gratification.

The crisis continues.

Course 18 (Math)

Sorry! I like math! Sue me!

I was taking 18.02 and noticed that the beginnings of college math felt a lot like high school math–take a subject with a name, learn a bunch of new operations and ways to do math, and then take tests on those routine operations and problem solving skills. Then I find out that a math major is proofs and I immediately lost interest. I don’t want to learn LaTeX, or why numbers exist, or how to connect those dots from Good Will Hunting. I like doing integrals though–so something with a little math or at least math class requirements is important.

Course 17 (Political Science)

This has been the crisis of a lifetime. I’ve talked about this before, but I was very very very intensely not a “STEM kid” growing up. I heard “you should be a lawyer” 10000000x more than “you should be a doctor” or whatever the equivalent is. Most of my friends ended up in poli-sci. I kept this attitude with me throughout high school, with essentially everything on my application and resume pointing towards a traditional humanities path in something like public policy/political science/international relations. And the issue is I am very interested in all of these things! But a part of me knows that I do not enjoy poli-sci classes as much as STEM or an alternative arts/humanity. I also know that I do not want to go to law school.

After a lot of 
        deliberation,
      
 I realized that I don’t want a job that comes out of a poli-sci degree, but instead anything I would want to do in the public sector would be related to public health policy or researching the effects on international relations on other issues (like health, education, science, etc.). All of these jobs can come with a background in a technical field, basic statistics/CS, or just any degree and a passion for it.

Part of me still feels weird not being a poli-sci major, but if I chose wrong I can just get a masters.

(and getting into politics with a stem degree is easier than ever, so potentially Hurst 2048🇺🇸🦅)

Course 11-6 (Urban Science and Planning with Computer Science)

This came post- the course 17 realization™ when I wanted to look at ways to use STEM for a more traditionally government/public job.

Then I remembered I don’t like coding enough and that’s where this major crisis came from in the first place.

Course 6-14 (Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science)

I found out that Jane Street quants can make $300,000 as a starting salary and I had a lapse in judgement that put me into a very capitalist mindset for like 3 hours, and then I remembered I don’t like coding that much and I don’t think the economy is real and I don’t want to work on Wall Street and I hate everything about business culture.

(but I’d still take the salary)

Course 21T (Theater)

Do I become attached to very intense pipe dreams very fast? Yes. Was one of those that I could drop out and become a famous actor? Also yes.

Then I started taking 
        21T.101,
      
 am having a bad time, and realized that if I were to become an actor, a major in theater-adjacent classes from a tech school probably won’t change that trajectory too much.

Course 1 (Civil and Environmental Engineering)

This lasted about an hour, but every now and again I feel the crushing guilt of climate change weigh on my soul and I feel guilty that I’m not using the resources I have to become a part of the solution.

I would hate it a lot though–next!

Course 5-7 (Chemistry and Biology)

Not a shocking choice, but like I said before, I’m not super sold on pure sciences because I’m not all that interested in research/academia as a career path. Realistically, it wouldn’t matter that much, and this along with any bio-related major would be enough to put me in biotech. I think the lack of math/applied technology is the main drawback for me, but the pure chemistry classes (like “inorganic chemistry” as opposed to the chemistry classes of ChemE like “fluid mechanics”) are interesting to me.

As of now, I keep 5-7 as my backup in case I have a crisis because a lot of the classes I’ll have to take anyway, and it’s close enough to what I want to do that it won’t be an issue.

Course 21L (Literature)

I’ve felt a very strong pull to commit myself to more than the bare minimum 
        HASS
      
 requirement. With poli-sci and theater out of the running, though, I’ve returned to the idea of literature.

I said a lot in high school that I wanted to double major in STEM and non-STEM because I didn’t want to neglect one or the other. My answer to this was always literature. I loved reading and writing as a kid, and literature classes were largely my favorite in high school.

I haven’t declared 21L yet, though, because part of it feels “useless”? Which is a common dilemma at a strongly tech school like MIT–everyone likes and takes HASS classes, but I feel like those can only be side quests. If I’m going to be a scientist, why stress myself out with the major requirements when I can just take a couple literature classes and call it good? I don’t know if I’ll declare the major, or a minor, or a concentration, but nonetheless I want to take a lot of lit classes while I’m here.

Course 10B (Chemical-Biological Engineering)

As I continued to grow weary of the amount of CS coursework with 6-7, I started thinking about other majors that could still put me in biotech. I have a couple friends who are planning on 10B, and the lab my UROP is in is a ChemE lab, so I had a lot of people to bounce questions off of (and also encourage me into switch to 10B).

The bio track is exactly the same as the other bio majors (20, 6-7, and 7), so even though it’s technically ChemE, I’m not changing the amount of biology I would be taking. I also would much rather take more chemistry-esque classes than learn about the “Mathematics of Computer Science” or “Algorithms”.

I also feel like the major is a lot less restrictive than the box I put myself in with 6-7. I am still interested in bioinformatics/comp bio, but I could easily go down that path with a biochemical background (like my UROP mentor and everyone in the lab I’m working in). However, if I back out and decide I want to do lab work or some other industry project, I’m not stuck to the computational side.

As of now, this is the major. 🎉

Maybe Course 7 (Biology)?

At this point not shocking. I still wouldn’t do only biology, but I noticed that all of the classes needed for course 7 are already covered by 10B except for one. If I get bored and take the extra course 7 class, I might declare the double just to have it (assuming I don’t major in anything else, which is 
        statistically
      
 unlikely).

***

If that felt like a lot–it was! It’s the weight bearing down on most of the freshman class right now.

I feel like a lot of people, both close to me and not, have a perception that because I go to a prestigious school and have always done well in school that everything should naturally fall into place–that I should feel confident that I’m meant to be here. I sometimes feel guilty that I don’t. Not in an imposter syndrome, I-don’t-deserve-to-go-here way, but in an I’m-still-very-lost-like-every-other-college-student way. I wasn’t born with the same intrinsic passion that a lot of my peers have. I haven’t known since I was three that I really wanted to be an engineer and that this was my life’s greatest dream come true. A lot of the time I still feel like a student who just went to college because that’s what most people do, and what else am I gonna do?

This is why picking a major has been so hard and fueled by indecision–I’ve had to 
        realize
      
 that I am not foaming at the mouth at the idea of having a job, that if you told me I won the lottery or became famous overnight, I probably wouldn’t continue this career path because “I love it so much” and “it’s my life’s purpose”. I just have to pick something I like enough to be a person with a job–which is normal, just not necessarily at MIT.

I need to find a way to separate whatever passions I can find and whatever professional stuff I have going on. This feels like an impossible task for me though. I’ve always taken everything to such an extreme that I end up hating it because it just becomes work. I can’t just be in a play, I have to be a theater major who goes on to be a famous actor. I can’t simply like to play piano, I have to drop out and go to Juilliard and become a Grammy winner. I convince myself things don’t matter if I don’t give my everything to them. What’s the point if it could be better? What can simply be dad lore and what is my actual career path? Does it intrinsically make something worse if it isn’t my career and just a hobby? Who knows! I probably won’t find the answer in my chemistry classes though, and that’s fine.

tl;dr i thought a lot about a lot of majors

p.s. don’t even ask how many different minors I’ve said I’m gonna get.",,0

Hey, I’m Kai. I’m a physics major (course 8) with minors in Chinese and math. Outside of school I like to write, and I’m involved in musical theater. I spent most of my time in college being confused and trying different things: I’ve lived in three living communities at MIT and loved different parts of each of them; I joined (and left) multiple engineering teams as an underclassman; I’ve taken a sort of convoluted path from astrophysics to fusion to now doing research in computer vision for ecology. If you’re also confused or just want to hear about the different things I’ve tried, ask away.

Hello! I’m Kano—a 2A (Mechanical Engineering in Global Development) major with a minor in 17 (Public Policy). My family’s from Thailand, and I grew up in Las Vegas. Some fun things about my journey through MIT:

- Though I didn’t expect to go into engineering research, I’ve ended up loving the work and have had the chance to contribute across three different labs.

- I’m proud to be part of the FLI (first-generation, low-income) community.

- I’ve explored MIT’s makerspaces through a variety of builds, mostly through mentoring for Project Manus.

- So far, I’ve traveled to five countries through MIT programs.

- I love the feeling of being small in big nature, which has led me on long bike rides and peaceful camping trips with the outing club.

The Cost of Living at MIT,Aiden H. '28,5,2025-04-14T00:00:00-04:00,"A couple months ago, I wrote about how to make money at MIT. Much to our collective dismay, there is another side of the coin: spending money. For most students, college will be their first experience largely handling their own finances in a day-to-day sense. As someone who notably does not have an Elon Musk-sized inheritance from my parents and who has to take care of pretty much all of their expenditures, choosing to live in a very expensive city was difficult.  Boston is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the US (see: Example A, Example B, Example C from a quick Google search). However, with enough adjusting to prices and scrounging for the best deals, I’ve found a way to make living work without having to eat instant ramen every day in the stereotypical broke-college-student way.

Curious to find how others think of Boston living prices, I sent out a poll on 
        Dormspam
      
 asking students how much they spend monthly to see the cost of MIT outside of tuition. Out of 4535 undergraduates, I got responses from 72 (more than I expected! but still kinda sad). I asked for the average estimated cost of both essentials (toiletries, clothes, dorm stuff, etc.)–split by those who are and aren’t on meal plans–and non-essentials (“unnecessary” food/treats, going out money, concert tickets, general Boston stuff, etc.).

The 
        summary stats
      
 are as follows:

Overall:

- if you are on a meal plan, the average student will spend about an additional $50/month on essential items, not including the cost of the meal plan

- if you are not on a meal plan, the average student will spend about $300/month on essential items, including food

- regardless of meal plans, the average student will spend about $100/month on non-essentials

Here are some key takeaways that I think people should consider.

Meal Plan vs. Cook-For-Yourself

Food is by far the most expensive, and variable, part of people’s budgets. Although students on 
        meal plans/in dining hall dorms
      
 are spending about $250 less per month, they pay upfront for dining when they pay tuition. The two meal plans offered for freshman (and also the most common) both cost $3824.25/semester. This means that a meal plan adds $957/month, but most students will factor this into tuition costs and financial aid instead of their day-to-day budgeting.

Because of this cost, a lot of students opt to live in a cook-for-yourself dorm that allow students to be completely in charge of their own food. While these can lead to less financial stress, it does require students to manage their time to grocery shop and cook, or pay for take-out meals consistently, which can potentially be just as expensive, have smaller portions compared to buffet-style dining, and possibly less nutritious.

Notably, students on financial aid can have their meal plan covered depending on their aid. I’m not an expert on the aid process and everything should be confirmed with 
        SFS,
      
 but I know that students on full financial aid like myself do have the cost of a meal plan fully covered regardless of dorm type.

Thoughts from anonymous poll-answerers:

- “Food cost is low because most of my meals are free food from clubs, events, the mailing list, being swiped by friends, etc.”

- “meal plan is so overpriced”

- “I try to only eat in the dining halls. All the Boston restaurants that aren’t fast food are soooo expensive”

Fun Stuff

Boston is a major-ish city! This means that doing things cost adult-living-in-a-major-city prices. On one hand, I want to go full-crazy I’m-totally-living-in-like-Friends-or-Sex-and-the-City and go to like a 
        concert
      
 or 
        nightclub
      
 every night. Still, I’ve personally found myself a lot less inclined to go out and get a quick coffee/see a movie/go to a concert because the cost is so inflated compared to the Midwest.

Fortunately, this is the most controllable expense, and utilizing campus-run events and services also makes this easier. 
        LSC
      
 runs movie screenings in 
        26-100,
      
 dorm and frat parties are generally every Friday and Saturday, and a couple times a semester the school will just host things for students (recently, a trip to the aquarium, museum of science, and the Maseeh Boat Cruise come to mind).

Thoughts from anonymous poll-answerers:

- “I would consider fun stuff essential to remain sane here”

- “I usually go out to eat about once or twice a week plus other snacks ends up being about $50 a week. Transportation (ubers), concerts and other purchases end up making the total a month about $400.”

- “monthly nonessentials expenses have ranged between a mean of $30/month my freshman year to $900/month last semester…”

It’s Not That Bad

Finances are scary, and spending money makes me feel guilty no matter how little or big the purchase. Still, if you’re able to work even a part-time summer job and then find a way to work a couple hours a week on campus, that should be enough money to make it through a semester, as long as you’re smart with the money you earned. Also, students who demonstrate the most financial aid often get returns each semester, which is extra financial aid money sent directly to you to cover things like dorm essentials/flights/anything you might need during the semester. Depending on the student, this can be up to an additional $3000 to ease the pain of college prices.

More thoughts:

- “i have a spending tracking spreadsheet and i try to stay under 200 a month”

- “these numbers fluctuate heavily based on how much i’m getting paid per week lmao…”

Happy spending 🤑🤑","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-3.40.31%E2%80%AFPM.png

Lax bros,Emiko P. '25,2,2025-04-14T00:00:00-04:00,"The start of spring is an important time — not because summer is drawing near, not because the temperature is heating up, and not even because the sun stays out past 6 pm. No, the start of spring means one thing and one thing only: it’s lax season!!

The women’s and men’s lacrosse games are staples of an MIT student-athlete’s spring. Those games are a great chance to get outside and watch some fire athleticism on Roberts and Jack Barry Field. 

I got the chance to catch up with Sydney P. ‘25 and Isaiah N. ‘26, and they told me a little bit about life as an MIT lax bro.

Tell me about yourself and what you’re involved in outside of lacrosse.

Sydney: Hi! My name is Sydney and I’m a senior studying Chemical-Biological Engineering (10B) and Finance (15-3). I’m originally from outside of Philadelphia, PA. Outside of lacrosse, I’m also a member of Greek life, a senior chair on the ChemE Undergrad Student Advisory Board, and a campus tour guide.

Isaiah: I’m a current third year studying electrical engineering and computer science. Outside of lacrosse, I am an undergraduate researcher at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, I work as a learning assistant for Computation Structures, and I’m an active member of a fraternity on campus.

Tell me about your lacrosse background and your lacrosse experience at MIT.

Sydney: I started playing lacrosse when I was in fifth grade and have been playing ever since. I didn’t always know I wanted to play in college, but when the recruiting process began, I quickly fell in love with the idea of playing and studying at MIT. It has been such an amazing experience — the mitlwax community is truly unlike any other I have been a part of. 

Isaiah: I’ve been playing lacrosse for 11 years now, starting when I was 10 years old. For almost all of those years, I’ve played on the defensive side of the field as a long stick defender. Specifically at MIT, lacrosse has played a central part in my experience here. It gave me the opportunity to continue playing the sport I love and I’ve even met some of my closest friends from the team. Overall, lacrosse provides a great outlet away from academics and work.

How is your season going so far?

Sydney: Our season has been really fun so far! We graduated a lot of amazing seniors last year, so this has been a year of rebuilding our program. We have grown so much as a unit over the past couple of months, and it’s been truly so fun to watch all of the pieces come together in our games. We are currently 6-1 in conference play and getting ready to begin the NEWMAC tournament.

Isaiah: The season has been going well so far. We’ve had lots of close games this year and have been playing some solid competition. I think we should be getting a good seed for NEWMACs at the end of the year.

What is something you’re looking forward to for the rest of the season?

Sydney: I’m excited to compete in playoffs and — fingers crossed — finish off our season with a NEWMAC Championship ;)

Isaiah: The main thing I’m looking forward to for the remainder of the season is playing the rest of the teams in the NEWMAC. Conference games are always the most intense and competitive. We even have some school rivalries going, so these types of games are always a lot of fun to play in. 

Best lacrosse memory from MIT?

Sydney: For the past two Spring Breaks, our team has been stuck on campus with conference games. So to make our own fun, we rented out an airbnb in Maine to spend a weekend together. I have made some of my best memories during my time at MIT during these trips — so many laughs, coffee walks, hikes, and just getting to spend time together.

Isaiah: My best lacrosse memory from MIT was winning the semifinal game in the NEWMAC tournament against Springfield. Springfield is definitely one of our rivals so there was a lot of build up before the game. The game was super close but we came out on top. 

Day-in-the-life in season?

Sydney: A Wednesday game day typically begins for me with waking up at 9 AM and enjoying my breakfast before crossing the Charles River from my house in Boston to campus for my first class of the day. At 10 AM, I have 10.490 Integrated Chemical Engineering. After class, I’ll head over to my fellow seniors Jules and Syd’s apartment to enjoy lunch together. Then, Julianne and I will head to our next class of the day at 1 PM at Sloan, 15.465 which is Alphanomics: Behavioral Finance. After class, we usually go to the Stud (Student Center) and print out our game day posters and buy snacks for our psych buddies before heading over to the locker room. Then the fun begins! The locker room before games is always so chaotic — filled with dancing, hair braiding, Celsius-drinking, and pre-game cheers. We’ll then play our game (and win!!) and spend the rest of the night having dinner and finishing up school work for the day.

Isaiah: On a typical day, I wake up at 9:00 AM to get ready for the day. Before heading to host 10:00 AM office hours for Computation Structures, I make sure to grab a quick snack. By 11:00 AM, I head to lecture for Design and Analysis of Algorithms. After lecture I head to lunch, which is almost always Chipotle or Cava. I then have about a 3 hour break where I usually work on my research or some problem sets. From 5-7 PM, I go to lacrosse practice and then eat dinner at my fraternity. For the rest of the night, I mostly do homework.

Favorite thing about the lacrosse team?

Sydney: I love how close our team is. We all genuinely care about each other so much, and I can say with confidence that spending every day together from 5-7 (or sometimes even longer) is always the highlight of all of our days. I can always count on mitwlax for someone to study with, get hype with, crash out with (after a tough loss), or celebrate with.

Isaiah: My favorite thing about the lacrosse team is the team culture. Everyone works hard around the clock both on and off the field, whether it be academics or athletics. Anytime you may need something, there’s always someone willing to help you out. Beyond that, the guys on the team always make sure to leave time to hang out with one another and have fun.

Good luck with the rest of your season, wlax and mlax! As always, roll tech!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-14-at-12.40.21_c081cf93-800x533.jpg

doctor worm,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",6,2025-04-08T00:00:00-04:00,"life has been weird. life has been extremely busy. it feels like things are clicking into place and falling completely apart all at once.

i worked all through spring break, including weekends — i think from monday the 17th to saturday the 29th i went into lab every single day. i justified it with the fact that i didn’t have any classes to take my time away from experiments, and i could just focus on doing things.

this past week, with classes resuming, my average time leaving the lab was around 9 or 10 pm. i’m studying progenitor cell migration in planarians, which are these silly little regenerating flatworms with cartoonish eyes that make them look all shy, and i had to learn how to perform transplant surgeries on them. but they’re small, and it’s very easy to mess things up.

i cut a hole in the recipient, cut the donor until all that’s left is a square piece of tissue, then move that to the recipient’s hole

needless to say, i was in survival mode every single day until i finished my last task minutes before midnight on friday.

now, i’m reeling from the intensity of that week. i’m taking a step back and realizing that it was unsustainable, that i might have lost myself somewhere along the way, and if i don’t reel it in i might end up somewhere i don’t want to be.

it’s just really easy for me to go into lab and spend all of my time there to run away from problems accumulating in my life. my messy apartment. maintaining my friendships.

but being a full-time lab rat as a coping mechanism comes at the cost of ignoring my assigned readings, doing my psets the night they’re due, long lapses in my responses to friends, having to miss events i wanted to attend and meetings that i’m supposed to be at…

i think i needed to learn this lesson the hard way. something needs to give if i want a more balanced relationship with work. i can’t let the worms take over my brain entirely.

even if they’re really cute

this week, my workload is a bit better — just dealing with a lot of long waiting times between steps. i still have a lot to do. i have papers for a discussion-based class tomorrow that i haven’t read yet, and i have a quiz for my other class on thursday, but there isn’t that same sort of confused despair that i was drowning in.

i think, most of all, being in community with the people around me has saved me.

- the culture at my lab is what keeps me from going insane — everyone is so sweet and funny and whip-smart, and they’ve welcomed me with open arms, and i feel like i’m accomplishing things. i went thrifting in porter square with some of them last sunday, and attended a concert at someone’s church where they were singing, and it’s all been so so wonderful. apparently we’re going to participate in in somerville’s porchfest, which i somehow have never heard of despite being in the area for four whole years??? but i’m excited to have a reason to practice playing the electric bass i bought last year.

- i officially became a member of WMBR, mit’s college radio station (88.1 fm)!!! i’ll be having my own show for the summer session. i need to figure out what i want to call it and what kind of music i want to play, but i’m thinking of making it worm-or-yarn-themed in some way…

- i saw someone knitting in my development class and we ended up adding each other on ravelry (a popular website for sharing fiber arts patterns and creations). in their bio they had the line “i’m not a real doctor, but i am a real worm,” because they studied c. elegans in undergrad, and i thought that was so charming.

I’m interested in things I’m not a real doctor But I am a real worm I am an actual worm I live like a worm [ … ] Someday, somebody else besides me will Call me by my stage name, they will Call me Doctor Worm

I’m interested in things I’m not a real doctor But I am a real worm I am an actual worm I live like a worm [ … ] Someday, somebody else besides me will Call me by my stage name, they will Call me Doctor Worm

like, yes!

- i’m interested in things. ✅

- i’m not a real doctor. ✅ i got into grad school, and that whole journey will be a separate post, and by the end of it i still won’t be a real medical doctor, and i won’t be studying worms anymore. but in my heart, my soul, and all levels except physical:

the best thing i did for myself as a pre-frosh,Veronica P. '27,3,2025-04-07T00:00:00-04:00,"The cherry blossoms are out and the students are slipping onto Kresge Lawn again, accompanied by instruments to strum and bubble teas to sip and soaking in the Boston sun on one of those early spring days where the warmth still feels like a tiny miracle. Campus is starting to resemble the campus I fell in love with, the one I encountered in this same state as a pre-frosh at Campus Preview Weekend.

I was one of those admits for whom CPW felt like a whirlwind of an experience, 3.14 days that whizzed by like a door violently swinging open on its hinges, revealing to me all the possible ways my life was capable of stretching and splitting and changing. Looking back, however, it was one of the most unassuming moments of the weekend that stuck with me the most.

I was alone and visiting this dorm, Burton Conner, for a free Thai food event. I loaded my plate, turned around, and was briefly catapulted into the classically mortifying high-school-cafeteria-where-on-earth-do-I-sit dilemma. Luckily, college orientations are funny in that they’re a lot like kindergarten, in that “everyone is a potential friend and everything is a friend-making opportunity” kind of way. So, I pushed down my fear and approached the table of people who, smiling and sporting thrifted clothing, struck me as friendly and cool (in the completely subjective, instinctive definition of the latter that everyone holds in their brain).

They immediately welcomed me, and if they weren’t so sweet I would have been way more embarrassed by the fact that not a single one of them was a pre-frosh. In a way, it was relieving— none of that pressure to ‘forge new bonds’ and make small talk. All of them clearly seemed to be good friends, so I was content to just sit back and watch the conversation bounce across the table. I laughed a few times, caught a couple of their names, and shyly excused myself once I had finished eating.

I didn’t think much of the half hour until a few weeks later, when it came time to rank my dorm preferences on the housing portal. I think something about that table’s close-knit, joyful energy had stuck with me. It was as if they served as living proof that it was possible to find your people at MIT. On a gut instinct, I ranked Burton Conner first, and eventually came to learn that the people I had met were part of the floor Burton One. They held a distinct passion for the color b1ue and referred to themselves as “the 
        Boners
      
.” Maybe the title should have given me pause, but honestly I didn’t even give it a second thought.  There were so many nuances about the community that mattered way more than that.

Flash forward about two years, and I’m one of our floor chairs. Not necessarily by choice— the election process did involve moderate amounts of chasing down the hallway and may have ended with me being dragged into our lounge with various seniors hoisting my limbs as I protested “NO NO NOOOOO”. 
 But that drama aside,  it still seems like every day I find a new reason to feel grateful for my split second decision to approach that table.

 

I feel it when I’m hiding in a dorm room with twenty people, all crowded around a blueberry cake and trying to stifle our laughter when we realize that the birthday girl we were trying to surprise at midnight has just turned on the shower next door.

 

I feel it when I’m counting down the ‘new year’ in the middle of March, because somehow we’ve all managed to fumble our resolutions so early into the year and could really use a second chance.

 

I feel it when we’re in our Associate Head of House’s hallway, lining the walls with tape art of her son’s favorite cartoon characters. People are making fun of me because I care way too much about getting the perfect perspective on my lego block.

 

I feel it when I’m trying to find a place to study between classes and I get a text announcing that it’s ‘romping’ weather. I know that if I walk past the student center I’ll find a group of us working on a picnic blanket, taking full advantage of the heat.

 

I feel it when I walk past the 32 kitchen and hear a makeshift band performing indie renditions while the not-so-musically-inclined prepare spring rolls.

Or when I come home to the 41 and see that the alignment chart is being updated, and 5 people are in a heated debate about whether one resident should be placed closer to “chiller” or “tweaker.”


Or when I get a text that there’s pad thai in the 52, and one of our DJ’s is mixing on the dining table while everyone grabs a bite.

Or afterwards, when we migrate to the 33 because their raspberry brownies have just come out of the oven, shamelessly interrupting their Survivor watch party.

 

I feel it when we’re the loudest group in the crowd, lifting a comically large cardboard cutout of a b1ner’s face and cheering their name.

 

I feel it when I spot figures in blue morph-suits prancing around the Infinite, wordlessly handing out fliers to confused passerby to promote our next event (we take our annual theme ‘everyth1ng 1s b1ue’ quite literally.)

 

I feel it when I’m on retreat in Maine, sprinting towards the lake with a giant bowl as two b1ners frantically scoop water out of their rapidly sinking boat, unable to catch my breath because we can’t stop laughing as they try to stay afloat.

 

I feel it when I’m on a boat in Mexico, lying in the sun with a junior who feels more like an older sister to me, reflecting on how much we’ve seen each other grow since the spring break prior. The waves pass gently beneath us and we talk about loving ourselves. The music crescendos from the other end of the boat and we talk about our desire to experience every emotion to the fullest, good or bad, because what else could be the point of living?  But who knows, maybe next spring break our answer will change again.

It’s hard to find a moment where I don’t feel it, to tell the truth. If there’s only one advice I could give to incoming college freshman, it’s to find people you can come home to. Maybe they don’t literally live on your same floor, maybe they share your values in different ways, but you need a network that can support you through what you’re going through— people you can consistently rely on to accept you and look out for your best interests, to help make your load feel lighter. As B1 likes to put it: more than friends, not quite family. 

 

In my first ever meeting with my freshman advisor, he ended it on a question he asks all of his advisees: “Have you found your community here?” 

And yes, I most certainly had.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2849-800x1207.jpg

"Food, glorious food",Andi Q. '25,4,2025-04-06T00:00:00-04:00,"If you asked me before spring break where I like to eat around MIT, I would have told you Simmons Dining (or maybe Maseeh Dining 
        more recently
      
). Despite having been at MIT for almost four years, I had not yet explored Boston’s food scene as much as some people have in their first semester. Even my sister, who has only visited Boston for a few weeks, knows more places to eat out than I do!

So when Aiden posted his tier list of MIT’s dining halls and rated Simmons Dining a measly B, I knew what I had to do over spring break – go out and eat at some actual restaurants near MIT. Plus, Simmons Dining was closed during spring break anyway, so I couldn’t eat there even if I wanted to.

Map of restaurants I visited over the week.

Day 1 (Saturday)

Maseeh Dining (Brunch)

This was my first spring break meal, and we were already off to a rough start. (Although I guess spring break had not officially started…)

Maseeh was the only dining hall open that morning, and I was not mentally/physically prepared to venture off campus quite yet. I don’t remember what I got (it was probably scrambled eggs and a bagel or something), but it was just okay.

Punto Rojo (Dinner)

To compensate for my sad brunch, some friends and I went to Punto Rojo – a small Colombian restaurant near the Boston Logan Airport. Punto Rojo is quite far from MIT’s campus (we had to take two separate MBTA lines to get there, and it took like an hour), but it was definitely worth the trip. The food was delicious (and contained vegetables), the portions were huge, and it was (relatively) cheap.

My order:

- A steak with salsa, fried eggs, plantain, salad, rice, beans, and an arepa (all for $14).

- “Corn custard” (from the drinks menu, which turned out to be just a bowl of corn kernels soaked in cold milk).



Day 2 (Sunday)

Veggie Galaxy (Brunch)

Still fueled by the adrenaline of venturing off MIT’s campus the previous day, I went to Veggie Galaxy for brunch. Veggie Galaxy is a traditional American diner on Mass Ave near MIT, with the twist that everything they serve is vegetarian. It looks extremely suspicious from the outside (
        almost like a drug den
      
), but it is actually very decent on the inside.

My order:

- A vegan shamrock shake.

- “Chicken” and waffles (the “chicken” actually did taste like real chicken, surprisingly).



Jahunger (Dinner)

It started drizzling in the afternoon, so I went to Jahunger – a Uyghur restaurant that makes hand-pulled noodles, right behind my dorm. It’s only about a block away from Simmons, but I didn’t know about it until this spring break. I wish I’d known about it sooner though, because Jahunger was one of the best restaurants on this list.

My order:

- “Non-alcoholic milk beer” (a drink that tasted like an Asian cream soda, kind of like Milkis).

- Jahunger noodles (their signature spicy hand-pulled noodles).

- “Not your typical honey cake”

Day 3 (Monday)

Cafe Luna (Brunch)

It was still raining in the morning, so I went to Cafe Luna – a popular brunch spot also not far from Simmons. I don’t have much to say about this place. It’s just regular brunch food, and they do it well. (Though admittedly, I was also not super adventurous in my order.)

My order:

- A latte.

- Corned beef hash with fruit.



Trader Joe’s Mandarin Orange Chicken (Dinner)

By late afternoon, it was pouring outside. I didn’t want to walk in the rain or call an Uber, so I just prepared the pack of frozen Trader Joe’s Mandarin Orange Chicken I had sitting in my freezer since January. A rather sad college-student meal, but it still beats going to a dining hall.



Day 4 (Tuesday)

Cicada (Brunch)

Cicada is a Vietnamese fusion cafe near the H Mart on Mass Ave. I went there on Gloria ’26’s and Janet ’27’s suggestion, because they think “their black rice is sooo good”. Gloria and Janet have eaten out a lot, so I thought this endorsement meant that the black rice would be life-changing. But honestly, it wasn’t that great. Like it was still good, but I went in with such high expectations that I was sorely disappointed when I took the first bite and didn’t transcend to a higher flavor dimension.

My order:

- Saigon espresso.

- Salmon black rice bowl.



Leftover Trader Joe’s Mandarin Orange Chicken and Avocado Salad from Target (Dinner)

Yeah. At least the salad made it somewhat healthier this time, I guess.



Day 5 (Wednesday)

Brookline Lunch (Brunch)

At this point in the week, my body desperately needed vegetables, so I went to Brookline Lunch – a Mediterranean brunch restaurant on Mass Ave. It’s like Cafe Luna but better (Mediterranean food >>> American food). But it’s also somewhat worse because they only accept cash, which I did not know until I got the bill, and consequently had to spend an extra $10 on ATM fees.

My order:

- Turkish coffee.

- Shakshuka.



Coreanos (Dinner)

Coreanos is a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant in Allston. Cuisine aside, it’s similar to Punto Rojo in several ways: it’s small, relatively far from MIT (I walked about an hour to get there), and the food is good yet cheap (I think this meal also cost me ~$14). I went here on Jebby ’25’s suggestion.

My order:

- Peach limeade.

- Coreanos bowl (Korean fried rice with a fried egg and miso soup).



Day 6 (Thursday)

Saloniki (Lunch)

Saloniki is probably the restaurant I’ve eaten at the most in Boston. It’s a Greek “fast food” restaurant right next to MIT’s campus, and it’s just so convenient yet also tastes so good. It’s like McDonald’s but healthy and generally better in every way. They also give you fries for free if you show them your student ID. I love Saloniki so much – writing about it makes me want to eat there again after posting this blog post.

My order:

- Grilled chicken sandwich.

- Student fries.



Shake Shack (Dinner)

I was in Boston helping two of my friends shop for their dance outfits, and we were all collectively craving Shake Shack. Just like Cafe Luna, there’s not much to say here – it’s Shake Shack, and it was exactly what you’d expect from it.

My order:

- Black truffle burger.

- Thai iced tea shake.



Day 7 (Friday)

Flour (Brunch)

I was running out of unique brunch places within walking distance from MIT, so I just went to Flour for brunch. Flour is a cafe that, for whatever reason, has two locations next to MIT half a mile apart from each other. I’d gone to the Flour on Mass Ave before, but this was my first time going to the other location, which was surprisingly much closer to Simmons.

My order:

- A latte.

- Chicken tikka masala naan sandwich.

This is a terrible photo, oops. I promise it tastes much better than it looks.

OTTO (Dinner)

OTTO is a pizzeria from Maine. It’s a popular free food option for student events at MIT, but I’d never eaten at the restaurant in person. I decided to go this time because they had a special promotion with a climbing gym I visit, where showing them your membership tag would get you 15% off your order. The food was… okay, I guess. I’m not a fan of their crust (it’s tough and chewy for some reason), but their toppings are good.

My order:

- Vidalia onion and sausage pizza.



Day 8 (Saturday)

Maseeh Dining (Brunch)

I know I said I’d try to avoid Maseeh Dining, but a group of my friends had just returned from a trip to Iceland, and they wanted to go to Maseeh because (a) it was close to Simmons, (b) they were jetlagged, and (c) Maseeh has many vegetables (which they were severely lacking in Iceland).

This time, I did remember to take a picture of my food:



For reference, this is the kind of food my friends were eating in Iceland:

Indomie and spam

Nirvana (Dinner)

After resting for a day, a few of my friends were ready to eat out again. We went to Nirvana – an Indian restaurant near Harvard. Nirvana is hands-down my top restaurant on this list. The food was just excellent, and it wasn’t too expensive either. Our entire order (listed below, split between three people) cost just over $20 per person!

Our order:

- The Nirvana Royal Vegetarian Dinner for Two (an unbelievably good deal), which included: Vegetable soup. Samosas. Malai kofta (crisp fried potato-and-cheese balls in a creamy fenugreek sauce). Palak paneer (cheese cubes in a spinach sauce). Unlimited rice and naan. Gulab jamun (basically Indian donut holes soaked in rose syrup). Kheer (rice pudding with cardamom, rose water, and cinnamon).


- Vegetable soup.

- Palak paneer (cheese cubes in a spinach sauce).

- Unlimited rice and naan.

- Gulab jamun (basically Indian donut holes soaked in rose syrup).

- Kheer (rice pudding with cardamom, rose water, and cinnamon).

- Chicken 65 (a chicken dish invented in 1965; I don’t know much else about it other than it tastes amazing).

Day 9 (Sunday)

Simmons Dining (Brunch)

Finally, Simmons Dining opened again! Eating out for the past week was fun, but Simmons Dining is still the only place where it’s socially acceptable for me to get food in my pyjamas.



“Mango Sticky Rice” (Bonus Second Brunch)

While returning from Nirvana the previous night, I bought ingredients for mango sticky rice from H Mart.

“How hard could it be?” I thought, “Surely it’s just three ingredients – mango, sticky, and rice?”

Well…

here’s how it turned out.

(And this is why I don’t live in a cook-for-yourself dorm.)

am i boring,Aiden H. '28,6,2025-04-05T00:00:00-04:00,"“There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”

— F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby

***

I have come to the profound realization recently that I think I’m boring. I’m not entirely sure where I sit with that.

More importantly, I’ve recognized that the pressure cooker of MIT doesn’t make me feel the academic imposter syndrome everyone prepared me for, but a social one. Why does the “endless” amount of resources and opportunities I’ve been given, and am very grateful for, by 
        this school
      
 create an inescapable mindset that if I don’t take all of them, I am not fully carpe diem-ing or whatever. Is how interesting I am proportional to my ability to be interesting, to do interesting things at this interesting place? Or to how much I do compared to those around me?

I feel that these questions rooted in our societal issues with the cult of youth blah blah social media whatever whatever late-stage capitalism etc etc mental health aaaaa aaaaaa trap me in a zero-sum game, as if my disinclination for doing much of anything isn’t nearly as bothering to me as it is to the adults who want to live vicariously through me, as if I’m being pursued by these great expectations that precede me, hunting me down into a corner of self-pity and loathing until I realize that it’s all stupid and past me, that I’m just told these things and they echo back in my thoughts as an exposure effect, not an actual feeling.

A lot of these “dilemmas” seem obvious to me, and are just matters of personal taste. Why would I study in the harsh lighting and uncomfortable seats of the Stud when I could easily study in my room, the space I specifically cultivated to be comfortable for me? (This means I spend most of my time in my room.) Why would I consistently spend money to study at a coffee shop when I feel less guilty if I just eat at the dining hall for free? (This means I don’t go to Boston much and I get sick of the food I’m eating.)

I convince myself I want things that I don’t because of these pressures. I fall into the trap of it anyway.

***

The most common piece of advice I’ve gotten since arriving at MIT is to try as much as I can. I think that’s bullshit–it’s overwhelming and makes me appreciate everything less.

I deleted over 150 emails from DormSpam today. They were all from the past two days. I don’t read any of the actual email, only the headers, and even then I only skim about half the headers as I scroll through. I’m probably not going to do anything in any of them. It’s too much.

I feel bad that I do none of this, spending most of my time studying and then decompressing through reading/TV/brainrot/croissants, just to start working again. But isn’t that what I’m here to do? Why do I feel so guilty for just trying to fulfill the most basic terms of my commitment to this school? This isn’t to say I’m the 10000%-always-on-the-grind-my-life’s-so-hard-all-I-do-is-work caricature that people impose onto MIT students. I’m kinda the opposite.

For as much as we spit out the phrase “work-life balance”, I feel like 
        I actually have one.
      
 It feels like the most appealing option for others is just to join the cacophony uttering the phrase and then proceed to not have one, and then I have to convince myself that I shouldn’t feel guilty for not doing the same.

This is the other side of it–if you’re not busy having as much “fun” as possible, you’re busy doing as much “work” as possible. Why can’t I just be neither? Why can’t I do an average amount of work, see an average amount of people/things, and then go to bed at the very normal 11:00 PM to wake up at the very normal 8:00 AM? I’m not a night owl I’m not a morning person I’m not a workaholic I’m not a socialite I’m not an extrovert I’m not an introvert. Why is everything so black and white?

Boring is just the average state of human existence–and that’s fine. I don’t feel the same insatiable need to run around and attempt to fill every hour of every day with a new pursuit that is worthy enough of becoming a story I tell other people.

But a part of me will always wonder if I’m going about this wrong, no matter which manner I act in.

My favorite book is The Great Gatsby. It turns 100 next week. I think it’s interesting how much we deify Gatsby considering the whole book revolves around how astoundingly weak and hurt he is. After 100 years, the 200 pages, 4 movies, and endless analysis, the thing we take away from The Great Gatsby is how fun it looks being rich and partying all the time.

'25,3,2025-04-04T00:00:00-04:00,"It’s a beautiful spring day here at MIT – the sun is peeking through the clouds, I was woken up this morning by birds, and we’ve now mostly exited heaviest-coat-in-the-closet weather (and are now entering bring-your-rain-jacket-everywhere weather).

What better way to enjoy this good weather than by going on a little adventure? I’ve been wanting to do a blog showcasing MIT’s many athletics facilities for a while now, so I think this is the perfect time to do it!

As you may have noticed, I’ve been kind of into the whole tour thing lately. From touring MIT frats and sororities to touring our new on-campus grocery store, it’s been fun to show off a little piece of what makes MIT so unique and special. I’d like to think that there’s something new to be learned for everyone, especially during this tour today – whether you’re a prospective or incoming student-athlete, someone who walks by these facilities on the way to class every day, or someone wondering what do you mean MIT has sports??

Of course, no tour is fun without some tour guides, so I brought along another person with me: Ashley E. ‘25, an attacking midfielder on the soccer team.

The Z Center

Ashley and I met up at the Z Center, which houses the Varsity Weight Room, the varsity locker rooms, the gym, and more that we’ll check out later in this tour!

 



Roberts Field

A short walk away from the Z Center is our first destination: Roberts Field. This turf field is very near and dear to my heart, as I have played dozens of games here and had hundreds of practices.

A good amount of varsity teams call Roberts home. In the fall, women and men’s soccer and football play their home games and practice here. These three teams rotate playing on Roberts and playing on the grass fields in the back (Fields A/B/C/D/E), which I’ll show you later. In the spring, men’s lacrosse claims Roberts Field, while the track team trains and hosts meets on the surrounding track.

Fran O’Brien Field

Next, we go to the baseball field right past Roberts.

Briggs Field

Right next door to the baseball field is the softball field!

Field A/B/C/D/E

There are five grass fields laying just beyond Roberts Field and neighboring both the baseball and softball fields. These are supplementary fields, especially in the fall when three different teams are taking turns practicing on the turf field. The varsity cross country teams also run around these fields multiple times a practice.

It’s also important that I mention that a lot of these facilities and fields are open to the MIT public as a whole, not just varsity athletes. The women’s soccer team often plays on Field D, and the 
        ultimate frisbee club team plays next to us on Field C pretty frequently.
      
 There are also PE classes that use these fields all the time.

To be honest, these fields do not have the best conditions. It’s pretty bumpy and can be frustrating when you’re trying to fine-tune and practice your technical control with a soccer ball – one wrong bounce and the ball is flying into your shin instead of your waiting foot. On the other hand, these less-than-ideal conditions have forced us to be better, because if you can’t adjust to Field D, you literally won’t be able to play. In that way, the frequent practice on Field D has definitely built character for the women’s soccer team. Whenever we know we’re playing a team and they have a grass field, we make sure to train on Field D so we’re prepared for any condition that can be thrown at us. 

At the end of the day: I’m super grateful that MIT has turf and grass fields available for us to use. 

Finding a new tour guide

Ashley has to part ways with us because she’s running a startup and needs to go talk to an investor, so I begin my hunt search for a new tour guide. And I find… Lauren D. ’25, a center defender for the soccer team! Lauren actually gave her first tour today as an official MIT tour guide, so she should be good at this. I have high hopes.

found her!!

Jack Barry Field

Jack Barry is home to field hockey in the fall and women’s lacrosse in the spring. My main association with Barry is that there is usually music bumping here every time I walk past it from 
        5-7 pm.
      


The duPont Tennis Courts and J.B. Carr Tennis Bubble

Our final outdoor athletics facility we will be visiting is the tennis courts and the tennis bubble. The tennis bubble is used for the tennis teams during chilly/rainy/snowy conditions. Both of these facilities are also open to any MIT student, and on sunny days, the tennis courts are usually filled to the brim.

Johnson Ice Arena

This was recently taken down because it’s spring, but in winter, this room turns into a hockey rink, where the club hockey teams play and where students are open to skate.



Another tour guide?!

On our way to the next stop in our tour, Lauren and I run into Eva O. ’25, my roommate and a forward on the field hockey team, who is in the lobby of the Z Center. She joins our tour with great glee!

kidnapping Eva

Zesiger Center Pool

Eva, Lauren, and I visit the swimming pool first. The women’s swimming and diving team recently won the D3 national championship, so we had to check out where all the magic happened.

Rockwell Cage

Our very last stop of the tour is Rockwell Cage! Rockwell is home to the men and women’s volleyball teams and the men and women’s basketball teams. There are two practice courts, as well as three badminton courts and five practice basketball hoops.

And that concludes our tour! We didn’t get to see everything, like the sailing pavilion, the crew team’s boat house, the squash courts, the rifle area, and more, but I hope you guys got an idea of what the athletics facilities have to offer. These facilities are more or less available to anyone at MIT, so I hope you all get to explore them the next time there’s a sunny day :)

As always, roll tech!

PE classes are…great!?,Aiden H. '28,2,2025-04-03T00:00:00-04:00,"Upon admittance, I dedicated a fairly serious and borderline-obsessive amount of time to look through the course catalog and major requirements for every major. Most of this was out of curiosity and 
        to itch the little part of my brain that loves irrationally planning and romanticizing classes.
      


So imagine me flabbergasted when I learn that in addition to all the credits for your major, 
        GIRs,
      
 and 
        HASS requirement,
      
 MIT is 
        one of the few
      
 schools that requires PE classes for graduation. Naturally, when people starting asking me about how many classes I had to take/how long until I take classes in my major, the first thing I mention is the seemingly random PE requirement alongside everything, much to everyone’s surprise and curiosity to how it worked.

The rules are as follows:

4-year undergrads must fulfill 8 “points” of PE. Transfer students need 4 points. These can be earned in various ways:

- Classes: A typical PE class consists of 2 points for an average of 4 PE classes needed. Classes are offered in 5 terms: Quarter 1 (Fall semester through October-ish), Quarter 2 (Novermber-ish until winter finals), 
        IAP,
      
 Quarter 3 (Spring semester to spring break), and Quarter 4 (spring break to spring finals). Most classes have 11 sessions, and students must attend 9 of 11 to get points.

- Varsity Athletics: A year of competition is 4 points. This means 
        student-athletes don’t usually take PE classes.
      


- ROTC: Two points per year of participation, but only for a max of 4 points (mwah-ha-ha)

The number of possible classes are extensive and almost overwhelming, but this means that there are enough classes with distinct vibes (e.g. weightlifting vs ballroom dance vs HIIT vs scuba), as opposed to the rigidness of high school PE that a lot of people hated.

Now having completed my PE requirement, I’ve found that they have been some of my favorite “classes” so far and, in a turn of events, I think I’m going to voluntarily continue to take PE classes?

Here’s a recap of the classes I took to fulfill my requirement:

Beginner Yoga (Quarter 1)

This class is located in the T Club Lounge, also known as a random room at the top of the very back of the 
        Z.
      
 I have no means of comparing this to a yoga class outside of MIT, so how “traditional” it was is beyond me, but I enjoyed the class nonetheless. We mostly focused on learning the basic poses that most of us have heard the names of (the “warriors”, the “dogs”) and some basic salutations and routines that we would repeat.

It was also an evening class, which was very relaxing because at the end of my class day, I would go move slowly and lay down in a dark room with spa music on.

Pickleball (Quarter 2)

Second quarter, my roommates and I decided to take PE together because we all had the same gap in our schedule. Naturally competitive, we thought it would be fun to do something where we could actively compete against each other instead of merely exercise in the same room. With all of us having played pickleball at least once before (and tennis not fitting our schedule), pickleball it was in the Z’s Rockwell Cages.



As grandma as it is, I actually really do like pickleball, and having an excuse to randomly play with friends twice a week was really nice. Like all PE classes, there were specific times dedicated to actual instruction. Having played before, being forced to start with “this is how you hit a ball” was a little annoying, but there’s no way for the instructor to tailor class to everyone’s skill level without starting with the very basics, and I’m not even that good so the extra practice didn’t hurt. I did learn how to serve a lot more aggressively over the course of the class, and I can confirm that my family and friends did notice when they got destroyed over spring break.

The one downside was the class was at 2 PM Tuesday/Thursday, sandwiched right between two of my classes, which meant I got all gross in my day clothes (outfit killer) and then had to arrive borderline winded to my HASS discussion while everyone else was normal (aura killer). This is common for a lot of PE classes and my one complaint. On one hand, I understand that staff work 9-5, so classes are going to be concentrated in those times, but so are lectures. It would be nice if there were a way to take strenuous PE classes like HIIT or weightlifting or spin or anything of the like without having to wear non-athletic clothing and not shower immediately after because of class.

Intermediate Yoga (IAP)

Like beginner yoga, this was in the T Club Lounge and featured a lot of my favorite thing: moving slow! More seriously, I really do like yoga/flexibility in general (especially when compared to an “alternative” exercise of weightlifting or more formalized team sports), and so I was excited to take another yoga class.

This class featured relatively more intense poses and progressions (headstands, handstands) and formalized a lot more of the traditional yoga concepts (dolphin pose, vinyasa breath work and breathing rhythms, etc.).

Beginner Skate (Quarter 3)

This was by far my favorite class purely because of the sheer indulgence of it. I’ve “ice skated” maybe 3 times before, which were almost entirely me and friends failing to skate, falling, and laughing about it. After a good 10 hours of practice through this class, I can semi-confidently say I can ice skate? Above anything, that’s just a funny and random thing to be able to say.

The class is taught seasonally for Quarter 2 through Quarter 3 when the Z has the Johnson Ice Rink up (instead of Johnson track for spring/summer). What was nice is the ice was reserved for class time, so I didn’t have to face the shame of trying to learn how to skate while all the secret hockey players and figure skaters put me to shame during a free/public skate.



The “curriculum” including forward skating, C-cuts, O-cuts, slalom, backwards skating, crossovers, stopping, and then transitions from forward-to-backwards and vice versa.

The instructors we had for this class were just, plain-and-simple, really great teachers who broke everything down to really simple moves that we would build on over time. Before we even started skating, they had us learn to stand upright in the skates without falling over. Then they had us just raise one leg at a time to prove we could balance entirely on one foot. It was small practices like these that made the rest of the class easier. Crazy how learning the fundamentals of something instead of rushing into it because you’re a really stubborn person who wants to be able to do everything perfectly the first time actually works!

Looking forward, there are still two classes I absolutely need to take before I graduate: tennis and sailing. Similar to my logic for ice skating, I think the ability to learn a super niche and fun skill for free is something that I don’t want to take for granted while here. Although the PE requirement seems like a burden, it’s a lot more a burden to pay hundreds of dollars for a local class later in life when you decide you’re actually interested/have the time. Most actual adults have to pay hundreds of dollars for the spin class, so try it now before you have to pay later. Also there’s nothing wrong with the Institute making sure we at least take two hours off a week to go soft brain and smash a ball or whatever.

tl;dr you have to take PE and you’re gonna like it lol","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-1-400x101.png

Rats !,Shorna A. '25,0,2025-04-03T00:00:00-04:00,"I did… kind of poorly on an exam recently. This exam (which was for 6.s966, Symmetry for ML) means nothing, in the end. I’ve finished my major requirements; I’m taking classes for my MEng early, so, in theory, I could drop any one of my classes with practically no consequences for my long-term plan. I can drop 6.s966 and absolutely nothing bad will happen.

Despite that, I felt inconsolably bad about the exam for a few days. It’s been a long time since I’ve so thoroughly bungled a test. There are many reasons that this particular mistake happened, including the eclipse of numerous pre-Spring Break deadlines and exceedingly poor sleep, but I’m used to expecting a lot of myself, and I was a bit baffled when I just… couldn’t deliver. The day after the exam, I laid in my bed for a while, staring at the soft eggshell paint of my ceiling and pondering my exam performance.

When I closed that exam book, my exhaustion-addled brain couldn’t suppress the desire to go back just 48 hours, so I could’ve slept just a bit more the past two nights. I wished I could go back a week, so I could fix the bug in my 6.7930 (ML for Healthcare) PSET a bit faster. I wished I could’ve transported myself back to pre registration, to change my course selection. Frankly, any number of different actions at any number of junctures might have prevented this outcome, and, as unimportant as the exam was in the grand scheme, I felt guilty. If I had just had more foresight, known just a little more, I could’ve done something differently and avoided this. 

My mind drifted from the exam, eventually. How far would you go back, if you could? What would you do differently? 

I often wish I had more seriously considered being a course 7 or 20; I’ve loved every biology class I’ve taken at MIT, but I’m a 6-3, and the waning practicality of cramming a 7 double major into one or two more semesters isn’t lost on me. In the end, a biology major likely wouldn’t have changed much in terms of my trajectory — my credentials as a 6-3 with a 7 minor are not so different from those of a 6-3 and 7 double major. That given, I’m pretty certain I would’ve been happier if I had just taken more biology classes earlier. My motivations for initially forgoing a biology major were complex, but in the end, I think it was a mistake. 

I probably should’ve made small changes in my choice of classes, rearranging the order in which I took various courses or optimizing time commitments more effectively. 

There are some things I wish I had tried earlier. I started singing at the beginning of college, and I think I’ve gotten pretty good at it, but I regret not starting earlier. At the beginning of this semester, I tried out for three a cappella groups, and was lucky to get into two, but I ended up turning both down. I think if I had more seriously considered a cappella a year or two ago, I would’ve been ecstatic to join such a group. At this point, though, I am feeling pretty fundamentally tired, and realistically, I’m better served by putting my extra time into research.

I’ve included numerous “rationalizations” in the course of listing my mistakes, describing the ways in which they aren’t so bad. Most of these mistakes are, in fact, relatively small, but I’ve certainly made big ones in my time. 

Immediately after my botched exam, I took the red line to the Boston Common, where I wandered into a cafe and flipped open a book. After a few hours of reading, I stepped back into the street, greeted by the diffuse brightness of a cloudy sky and a soft, enlivening smattering of frigid mist on my face. I descended the steps to the subway and scanned the pearlescent red tiles that indicate the entrance to the red line. I thought of October of my freshman year, the first time I took the T to the Park Street station with an ex-friend. I was so much younger then, starry-eyed and pathologically prone to seeing too much good in people. I’ve been burned many times because I believed people were kinder than they were. I really regret the friends I chose as a freshman. 

I wish I had spent more of my time in Bangladesh talking to my grandfather before he died. I was lucky to spend many, many hours getting to know my maternal grandmother, but my grandfather died in his sleep when I was 10, back when I was barely able to hold a conversation in Bangla. I’ll never get to know him.

I periodically deeply regret not becoming a doctor. I regret how much time I spent feeling abjectly terrible about myself as a child. There was a boy I really wish I had admitted I loved.

All of this is a dangerous rabbit hole. For most of my life, I devoted myself to living without regrets. Having thoroughly demonstrated that I’m a deeply regretful person, this mostly manifested as being as diligent as possible. I didn’t regret exam scores in high school because I was neurotic in my endeavor to avoid such mistakes. This also manifested as a deep-seated phobia of oversights. I didn’t submit my MIT application during the early round, because I felt I hadn’t yet put enough time into the essays. I worried I was in for a lifetime of regret if I submitted early and got rejected. I’ve always spent the full time at every test, triple- and quadruple-checking for errors that I might’ve overlooked. I spent 15 minutes annoyed at myself for the tiny miscalculation I made on my last 7.03 (Genetics) PSET, wishing I had been more attentive. Apparently (according to my very-insistent friends), I am always visibly stressed while driving because I’m compulsively anxious about hitting someone.

The reality is that I’m defined by my mistakes as much as I am defined by my successes. People are like paper. One cannot make it through life without some crumpling. We learn from the ways we crease; the particular mistakes I must guard against are the ones that have, in the past, left the most indelible of marks. I have become infinitely less naive than I was as a freshman. That said, I worry about letting my creases become tears; constantly endeavoring to avoid regrets has (evidently) made me a more tired and stressed person, and my therapist has periodically pointed out my difficulty trusting people.

I’m spending the first half of Spring Break in New York with some friends; today, we visited Flushing. After indulging in some excellent seafood udon and poking around the neighborhood for 5 hours, we boarded the 7 train, which we rode back to Central Station in Manhattan. While the urban jungle of Queens flashed through the windows, I thought, again, about going back to my freshman fall. I would be a different person, now, in any number of ways, if I had to replay my life. More knowledgeable about biology (and probably less well-versed in operating systems). Probably better at singing. Less ridiculous in hindsight, perhaps. Less rough around the edges. 

But I wouldn’t be me, and I certainly wouldn’t have been able to develop my friendships in the same ways. As I hefted the stoneware rat statue I had acquired at an antique shop (picture included below! The rats are very cute!), I giggled at a particularly absurd joke my friend had made. In another world, I wouldn’t have gotten the chance to enjoy this reality, which is undeniably pretty wonderful. It’s different from the one I planned, and sometimes different from the one I wish for, but wonderful nonetheless. I am crumpled, but still totally intact.

classes im taking this semester!,Angie F. '28,0,2025-04-02T00:00:00-04:00,"Now that I’ve survived enough midterms to know I won’t change my schedule, here it is:

- 6.1010: a.k.a Fundamentals of Programming! I mostly spent last semester knocking some 
        GIRs
      
 out of the way, so this was the first computer science class I’ve taken since high school, and I couldn’t be happier to be returning to my roots. Instead of the traditional bi/triweekly lecture + (bi)weekly recitation + weekly pset class format, this class only meets twice a week in small recitation sections that cover concepts that are relevant to our weekly readings and labs. The labs are typically my biggest assignment on any given week, but they’re pretty fun, and the lab assistants (LAs) run a total of 18 open lab hours a week that you can go to if you need any help, in addition to regular traditional office hours that are meant for more conceptual questions. The bulk of my lab work is typically completed in these lab hours, since there’s always someone right there to answer any questions that may arise. Additionally, 20% of your grade on each lab comes from your checkoff, which you can complete by going to an open lab hours session and answering a few questions from an LA about your code. Right now, we’re working on coding up n-dimensional Micesleeper (a spinoff of Minesweeper), which, despite being one of the more notorious labs in the class, has been pretty chill so far. I’m sure I’ll be eating my words in a day or two.

yay 6.1010!

- 6.1200: a.k.a Math for Computer Science! This is an introductory discrete math course: so far, we’ve gone over basic proof techniques, state machines, algorithm analysis, number theory, and graph theory. “A little bit of this, a little bit of that!” ahh class😭Aside from
         a two week graph theory course I took one summer
      
, brief brushes with competition math, and years of friendship with known combinatorics nerd Carlos R., my discrete math knowledge was quite limited before this class, and it’s been fun to learn and adopt a new way of thinking and approaching problems. Additionally, the lecturers are all really lovely and make class very entertaining: my friends and I actually sang a song about graph theory for the class earlier this week, which I’ll write about in an upcoming post. I got cooked to death on my last midterm but it is okay because there is beauty in the struggle and locking in extra hard for the next one will only make me stronger!!!!! <- coping so hard

me right now

- 18.06: a.k.a Linear Algebra! I’d planned on trying to 
        ASE
      
 out of this one during 
        IAP
      
, but things didn’t end up working out, which means I started off the semester having covered all the material using Professor Gilbert Strang’s textbook and 
        OCW
      
, lectures. I may or may not occasionally (or more than occasionally) neglect this class more than my others as a result :p whoops. Regardless, I do love, love linear algebra: I have a lot of fun with these psets and always know that the TAs will be helpful with any questions that may pop up, since office hours for this class have consistently been very good. I did have a very scary experience with our second midterm, but then the teaching team graciously mega-adjusted grade cutoffs for it and I was happy once again. another win for angie fortnite 

- 14.01: a.k.a Intro to Microeconomics! I did not take any 
        HASSes
      
 last semester, so I doubled up this semester in order to get on track to complete 
        the requirement
      
 in time (though, as evidenced by the length of the 24.09 section of this blog post, I’m sure that won’t be an issue either way). 14.01 isn’t a very traditional HASS (it’s part of a minority of HASSes that give psets) and will probably not even remotely tie into my future academic and professional endeavors, but I wanted to do something about my embarrassing levels of economic illiteracy and figured this would be a good place to start. It’s been enjoyable so far, and I’m glad to be getting the foundational knowledge needed for some interesting-looking course 14 classes I could end up wanting to take in the future. I also want to point out that our professor will toss you a sick 14.01 hat if you answer or ask a question during lecture. 

my friend ben’s hat

- 24.09: a.k.a Minds and Machines! Last but far from least, this is a philosophy class where we explore fundamental questions surrounding consciousness and philosophy of mind. We spent the beginning of class defining and examining things like consciousness and the mind, and now we’re playing around with those concepts to ask and answer questions about what it would require and mean for a machine to understand or think or feel like a person does. It’s an incredibly interesting topic, and what lies ahead seems like it’ll be even more interesting still: I feel like these snippets from the syllabus do it more justice than I could.



A final paper and exam make up the brunt of your 24.09 grade, but my weekly workload for the class is usually composed of a couple of readings and the occasional video. Additionally, we’re required to post either a question about the reading or an answer to another student’s question with each lecture’s reading, which I like a lot more than the traditional discussion board format that usually consists of a lot of observations about the reading and everyone in the replies simply nodding along. Not only does the question-answer format inspire more interesting discussions, being prepared to question the text I’m reading requires me to think a lot more critically about it than I would otherwise. Asking a good question is often a lot more difficult than answering one is, and I think it’s a great skill to be gained from this course. The most popular questions are discussed at the end of our lectures, which are some of my favorite lectures of the semester. Our professor is super enthusiastic about the subject and makes the lectures entertaining even when I’m pulling up to class first thing in the morning off four hours of sleep. Here are some lecture slides to show what I mean:

In addition to all the philosophical insight I’ve taken away from this class, it’s also been a welcome change of scenery from the rest of my classes. I spent most of first semester with this on my whiteboard:



I do, admittedly, feel my best when I’m moving very fast. And the mentality encapsulated by this quote is an especially easy one to let yourself fall into as a STEM student, especially at a place like MIT: you want to race through your reading or watch lectures at 2x speed so that you can do your psets as quickly as possible, so that you can get to next week’s psets and get through those as quickly as possible, and now that you have some extra time on your hands you could take a day off but you should work on those personal projects you have on the backburner, and now more psets are dropping so it’s time to grind out those too… I’m not trying to claim that that’s the way it has to or should be: I still make an effort to balance work with everything else, and I have many, many friends here who are way better at that than I am while also doing extremely well academically and professionally. But if you’re like me, then that’s definitely the way it can be. 

Approaching my 24.09 readings with that mentality, however, did not go well. It felt like I was sprinting on one of those little hamster wheels, going as fast as I could then finding myself back where I started as I realized that I had not absorbed a word of those four paragraphs I’d just blinked past. This was a new phenomenon for me: I’d spent the first 18 years of my life effortlessly falling into books for hours on end without giving it much thought at all. A HASSless first semester had clearly flipped a few bits in my brain, and I had to remind myself that it was necessary to slow down here in order to nudge them back into place. 

When I get really caught up in my work (which is kind of my default state), I tend to turn my life into an optimization problem, and that makes indulging in tiny joys, like taking five extra minutes of travel time to explore a new route to a familiar place or stopping by the Maseeh 3 lounge on my way back to my room, very difficult when they could be dedicated to an iota of a pset instead. But on busy days, those are the things that usually grant me the perspective to fully enjoy everything else. I recently joined MIT’s Science Policy Initiative book club and my friend Christine and I have agreed to read Dostoevsky’s “Notes from Underground” at the same pace, two things that would’ve been unthinkable last semester, when all my spare reading time was “best spent” on combing through research papers for my UROP. In this way, 24.09 has indirectly served as a constant reminder to live my life intentionally and deeply instead of trying to skim over as much of it as I can.

Ok, that’s it. Kidding! There’s one more:

- SAILING! I don’t have much to say about this one since it starts next week, but I’m so excited for it that I deluded myself into thinking it actually started this Tuesday and showed up to an empty sailing pavilion. Passing this class gives you lifetime access to the boats in the MIT Sailing Pavilion, which is situated along my favorite section of the Charles River. I’m looking forward to writing more about it soon!

YAYAYAYAYAY!!!!!!!!

What else am I up to!

- Finding gainful employment: what’s that… what’s a job…💔I left the lovely lab I’d been a part of since September a few weeks back, a change that, while due, was jarring, partly since it left me without any summer plans. I’ve spent the weeks since job hunting, and I’m happy to say I found a UROP I really, really like and have recently been working on some initial projects for it :) More on that soon!

- Arcturus outreach: I run outreach for Arcturus, MIT’s autonomous robot team, so I’ve been planning plenty of events for them this semester. We taught a class at Splash last month, we’re currently running a semi-regular exhibit at the MIT Museum as part of their Student Gallery Cart program, and we’ll be hosting an event for admitted students at Campus Preview Weekend. I’ve always been really passionate about STEM outreach, so it’s been great to have been able to reach so many different people through so many different events in the past months :D

- dynaMIT planning: In a similar vein, I’m on the board for dynaMIT, 
        a summer program that gives underserved 6th-9th graders in MA a chance to explore STEM
      
. Right now, we’re in the final stretches of selecting mentors, accepting students, and finishing up curricula. I’m on the student relations and the computer science teams, so I’ve mostly been busy with those last two.

- Campus tour guide training: okay I’ve been punting this since IAP so I’m putting it on here so that I actually do it. I’ve wanted to be a tour guide for at least a little bit since before I even got here, and I think it would be a great summer sidequest!

- Blogging: need I say more

- choosing a major: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I still think it’s insane that I basically just get to do math all day. The amount of fun I’m having with my classes right now, despite lots of them still being fairly general introductory ones, is giving me so much hope for the next THREE YEARS of learning whatever I want at my favorite place on Earth. I’m already looking forward to my next iteration of this post and, like always, I’m grateful for everyone who chooses to make this journey with me through the blog :) let’s hope this next wave of midterm goes well or else I’ll use my soon-to-be-acquired sailing knowledge to ride away down the Charles never to be seen again. i’ve heard nantucket is nice this time of year…","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0978-400x533.jpeg

Little Pieces of Living,Sara N. '28,0,2025-04-02T00:00:00-04:00,"In January, I came back to campus for IAP and got to do a healthcare innovation internship at the Boston Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Center through one of the MIT Priscilla King Gray (PKG) Public Service Center programs. I was lucky to be surrounded by kind and passionate people who encouraged me to work on projects that interested me, even if they were completely outside of my skillset — this is how I ended up learning C++, Arduino electronics & programming, and survey design + human-centered design interview methodology, all in the span of the month. I shadowed a rounding team at one of the VA campus hospitals, and visited the VA’s Brain Bank, where I held a brain in my hands and then watched a cutting. It was an enriching time for me, and I learned more about what kinds of things I wanted to do more of, and what kinds of things I felt I could do without.

What else? I woke up most days before the sun came up in order to catch the 7:30 bus for the first leg of my morning commute. I shopped at Trader Joe’s for the first time in my life, and grew to love their chicken tikka masala frozen meal. I went bouldering for the first time, despite being solidly afraid of heights, and found that I loved it. One of my roommates was also on campus for IAP, so we cooked a bit together. We made quesadillas with the stove turned on all the way — inadvisable, but much more fun that way — and many servings of pasta. We made pancakes one weekend morning with friends, with chocolate chips & whipped cream & fresh fruit; I’m usually ambivalent about strawberries, but I swear I didn’t have anything short of the sweetest that day. We baked apple cider shortbread cookies with another friend, though the cookies turned out to be dismal in both flavor and texture. But these things happen.

Then there were the days when January felt unbearable and insurmountable. These were the days when it got dark before 5, making almost half my waking day feel like a perpetual 10pm. Even daylight hours seemed restrained and half-hearted. I can hardly remember blue skies, only the tense white-gray of a sky flushed with snow. The wind was largely harsh and uncompromising, and the chill was biting. Some days I would come back from work with swathes of my face and hands red & raw & covered with small, soft bumps — windburn from just minutes of exposure.

If I’m honest, though, I can barely remember those days. Now, when I think of January, I think about the rarer days when the sun was truly out. I think about a wonderful conversation I was lucky enough to have with a doctor I met when I and the other MIT interns sat in on an endoscopy procedure through the VA. I think about the time I had a Subway sandwich for the first time in almost a year and how the time in between made me realize that my regular order was genuinely delectable. I think about the time I stared out the window the entire time I was on the Green Line train and tried my best to look at everything I was seeing. I had There She Goes by The La’s playing on repeat and I had felt like a part of me was soaring.

I am glad memory can work like this.

By the end of January, I was beginning to like Boston. In February, I went out into Boston alone for the first time, an experience that turned out to be so pleasant, I had to write out physical sentences about it afterwards:

 

Yesterday, I heard birdsong for the first time in months. I was out in Boston, walking along a cobblestoned stretch of Tremont Street, and saw a group of song sparrows darting in and out of and fluttering all around a bare-branched bush that rose till my shoulders. The sky was a real, full-throated blue. It was nearly 3PM, and the sun felt warm; there was no wind. It had snowed almost continuously just days before, but all that snow was now pushed away to the sides in great grey muddy mounds. Everything around me was in smooth, loose motion – the snow-mounds beginning to drip into drains, the thin rivulets of water tracing their way down rooftops & door frames, the sparrows and their unhurried circles.

 

I still get nervous, like a clenched fist, when I go out into Boston. If I’m alone, I keep a call with my mother running on in the background, just in case, I guess. I don’t know if this nervousness is something I’ll grow out of, or if its just an indelible consequence of growing up away from and a little distrustful of cities, but I think I’m fine either away. I like this tentative thing I’ve got going with Boston.

February was also the start of classes. I had a feeling I would love my spring classes more than I loved my fall classes, and for the most part, I was right. My favorite class right now is Introduction to Machine Learning (6.390), which has helped me appreciate the many moving pieces and the very real math behind the seemingly magical ML algorithms. My recitation professor, on the first day, said something along the lines of how machine learning, to some degree, is all about learning representations of the natural world, and in order to make accurate predictions or classifications or whatever, it has to learn something about us. I think it’s a beautiful idea. The class is hard for me, but I love it regardless, and feel more certain than ever that I want to work in, not just with, machine learning in my career.

In parallel to 6.390: I filled up an entire notebook with Differential Equations (18.03) notes & homework, and am halfway through the new one; I’ve gotten to do some more in-depth readings about the heart for the UROP I’ve been doing since fall semester, and I am still struck by how intricate of an instrument it is; I learned, while studying for the three midterms I had the week before spring break, that I love making crib sheets for exams.

It is April now. Two days ago, I was at home for break. Kentucky was warm and at the cusp of full bloom, though I had to leave before I could see it. Twice in those ten days, I woke up, not to sunshine through blinds, but to birdsong so collectively loud that it clearly permeated through our windows. I did a lot of grocery shopping with my family. I read out loud to my little brother. I ate a lot of good food. Now, I am back on campus.

I wrote this post because I’ve been thinking, recently, of a passage from one of my favorite books of all time— A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith. I read it for the first time when I was 10, and vaguely disliked it. I read it again at 12, and decided it was the most profound, lovely thing I’ve ever read. Since then, I’ve re-read it every other year; last semester was my fifth re-read. In a sense, I’ve grown up with the book. It’s shaped me in a lot of ways, some of which I recognize, many of which I’m sure I don’t. The passage I was thinking of is:

 

“Dear God,” she prayed, “let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry…have too much to eat. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere – be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost.”

 

I had been thinking about the little pieces of my living that have been lost, and then thought— they can only truly be lost if I let them. This was my attempt to collect some of the details from these past three months. January, February, March. Onto the next.",,0

[Guest Post] A day in my life!,Ellie F. '28,2,2025-04-01T00:00:00-04:00,"Hi everyone! I’m Callie T, and Ellie invited me to share what my day looks like as a junior studying physics!

11:15 — I ignore my alarm.

11:20 — My second alarm. I ignore this one too.

11:25 — I roll over at this alarm.

11:28 — This alarm is louder. I start blinking.

11:29 — Another alarm. 

11:30 — I slowly get up while cursing at the world.

This term, I promised myself that I’d attend all my lectures to avoid a repeat of last term, and the term before that, and also everything that’s happened since the second term of freshman year. Of course, I have by now missed my 10 am physics lecture. All my sets are terrifying, and I’ve been totally lost in that class for weeks. The current plan is to work on it with some friends after dinner.

12:00 — I grab a sandwich and a large black tea for lunch, and then I take a caffeine pill because a large black tea will not cut it for today. It’s a pretty quick meal, and I run into a few friends that have also just woken up. 

12:30 — I try to watch the physics lecture recording from today, but I give up halfway when I realize I don’t know what half the variables mean.

1:00 — I go to economics class. It’s more comprehensible than physics, but I’ve still got a set due tomorrow morning that I need to finish.

2:00 — I write some emails. Then, I preemptively draft an email requesting an extension on the physics set. 

2:30 — I try watching the physics lecture again. Doesn’t work the second time either.

3:14 — I work on that econ set. I keep confusing the econ variables with physics variables

4:23 — I dread grad school applications while watching the turtles at the pond where I’m working. I am jealous of those turtles. They don’t have grad school applications. I get another large black tea from Red Door.

4:30 — I continue working on the econ set. I’m nearly halfway through!

5:24 — I take another caffeine pill when I realize I’m blinking extremely slowly.

5:25 — I keep working on that econ set and actually manage to finish it!

5:58 — I head back to Dabney House and doomscroll on LinkedIn while waiting for dinner to start. It’s definitely a good thing that I’ve finished econ, so that I can focus on physics tonight.

6:15 — Dinner begins with the ringing of the bell. Announcements are made while we eat, and I think about my Google Calendar, which I commit to memory every week. At the table, a few of us talk about sleep schedule optimization. I learn that Jason believes in microdosing sleep by taking 1 to 2 hours naps several times a day. On the other hand, Sherry sleeps for 18 hours straight once every few days. Tomas gets a full 6 hours a night but they’re still a frosh so they don’t count.

7:45 — And now the physics grind begins. The other physics majors and I convene and start lamenting our naive choice in major years ago.

9:00 —  I have a shift guarding the school cannon for an hour, to make sure it doesn’t get stolen. In the darkness, I hear whispering sounds. Is it just the wind, or tortured souls whispering integrals?

10:00 — Back to physics! But first, I get a medium black tea.

11:42 — I pass out for fourteen minutes and dream that our beaver mascot is speaking to me. He says, “Callie, what have you become? I am worried about you. Today you were talking to the turtles. They cannot understand you. They don’t even need to apply to grad school. Your life is so much more than sets and lectures and caffeine pills. Do not waste these years. And please get some sleep. Christ.” Then, Bernoulli the Beaver morphs into three turtles that talk in my mom’s voice, asking me when I’ll settle down with a nice boy and also telling me to call her more often. The turtles disappear and are replaced with a large black tea. It says the answer to problem seven is 15.7π m*J/(C*s).

I wake up. My friends are unfazed. I tell them what the black tea told me and Carlos gently informs me that problem seven is supposed to be a proof. I take another caffeine pill. And another one for good measure.

1:15 — my alarm that tells me to get a snack from Red Door goes off. I decide to get a green tea this time, as well as an avocado toast.

1:42 — no progress has been made on physics since the Red Door trip. We do affirmations and pass around a can of Monster for morale.

3:00 — It is now 3 am. Two people have passed out. We have finished two more problems.

4:14 — lpfyhssics /sso hard

4:47— hgfffmmmmghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fjgjjjjjjjjjhhhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

And that’s what my average day at Caltech is like! Thanks for reading :) I think I need some caffeine.",,0
seven scenes from Paris,Kai V. '25,1,2025-03-31T00:00:00-04:00,"(ONE: Seeing my friend again after two months, the unexpected warmth, all old things returning.) We walked to a boulangerie and ate the best pastries I’d ever had: croissants, a baguette, a squishy thing, a glazed honey thing. “I would never even consider going vegan if I lived in Paris,” I told Uzay, sitting there next to him in the park, breaking off bits of the loaf to share, letting its flakes fall to the ground between us. We made conversation, I can’t imagine what about, mainly to feel the rhythm of speaking to your best friend again, after forgetting—but not really, for how quickly it was dredged up again, like the structure of a dream you’re reminded of after waking—how the back-and-forth of our voices sounded together.

(TWO: Giving up on stepping around puddles, my socks soaked through, the Seine dark and gray.) It was evening, everything had closed, even the great facade of the Notre Dame was obscured by the massive clouds of dust being whipped around by the wind. Every other building looked like a monument. I gasped aloud when the Eiffel Tower emerged from behind granite, so much taller and darker than I ever imagined I’d see it. Later I’d go up close on a sunny day, note the trusses (more bronze than silver, in real life) stretched between arcs of steel, hundreds and hundreds of interlocking bars—but it was this first glimpse of the tower in the dusk that I remembered. We padded through the courtyard of the Louvre; through its great windows sculptures danced in candlelight. “Let’s go back,” I said, cold and drenched even underneath my giant flapping poncho. We ducked into a bar first, sipped warm cinnamon wine and cracked a fork into the surface of creme brulee. How warm I felt then, and how content.

(THREE: Wandering around Montmartre, stone walls twisting around me, trying to find lunch.) Oil painters displayed their works along the cobbled streets, depicting Paris in grayscale vignettes, impressionist flairs, slabs of pure color spread by a palette knife. I couldn’t see the Eiffel Tower from the top of that hill—the whole skyline was blocked by the walls and buildings crowding the narrow roads—yet most of the painters I saw were working on a new rendition of its elegant figure to stack onto those already sitting on their fold-out racks. I wondered if they’d seen it so often they no longer had to reference it, or if they climbed the steps to Montmartre, easel in hand, dreading the next ten towers they’d have to draw, or if they saw their home in a new light, with sharper colors, from higher angles each time they filled a canvas.

(FOUR: Entertaining my impulses towards tourism, being swept with the crowd through the Louvre, swarming over marble stairs.) I’d heard seeing the Mona Lisa was underwhelming, depressing even. But I found myself in that room anyway, gridlocked in a crowd pulsing and throbbing with phones held in the air like teenaged concertgoers. I have almost no memory of her face, nor of what it felt like to see her apart from my annoyance at the bodies pushing firmly against me and the unreality of standing five meters away from such an iconic painting, before the museum staff unhooked the rope and waved us towards the exit. I was fed up with Paris at the end of it all. Though I knew it was an oversimplified story, that of capitalism run amok, it was amplified with every twinge of repulsion I felt at shops selling T-shirts with Mona Lisa dabbing (a surprisingly common motif) or collages of stylistically-mismatched clip art: PARIS, coffee, baguette, beret.

(FIVE: Turning my phone off in the morning, tourist desires quenched, thinking of what Uzay had told me, how “the city rewards spontaneity.”) I took the train into town and wandered into a coffee roaster and successfully ordered a cappuccino in French. The joy from that single sustained interaction buoyed me through the whole day, the ecstasy from speaking to the brown-haired girl behind the register in another language and hearing her respond in the same language, even if I was just saying stupid small things: lait normal (“normal” because I didn’t know how to say “oat” or “soy” or “whole”), pour ici, merci beaucoup. There was nothing extra behind my words, I mean, no management of tone or idiom, because I wouldn’t know how to manage those things in French anyway. There were just the bare meaning of the words and laughs exchanged and the coffee poured into a ceramic cup for me to sip at the window, paging through Swann’s Way and feeling little pings of recognition at the Parisian locations Proust mentioned, now that I’d actually visited some of them.

(SIX: Following map routes to the Pantheon, a building commemorating the people behind the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, its tall dome rising above tall pillars.) The walls were covered with murals. I skimmed over most of them but stopped before one which depicted Saint Genevieve’s death, her eyes clouded over with blindness, thin arms outstretched to bless the crowd around her. It was painted on a scale larger than life, its vertical span more than twice my height, thick strokes layered to shape the frocks of the men and women standing around, the dirty feet of a woman kneeling at the foot of the bed, the naked torsos of the people who had removed their clothing to receive her blessing. We told such a simple story now—of a religious figure and her audience—but, standing there, it felt no less true than the individual stories of all those who had walked to the saint’s bedside centuries ago to watch her passing, who had felt so moved as to take off their shirts and reach their hands out and hold up their babies, hoping for more.

Underneath the Pantheon a crypt held the remains of renowned French scientists and philosophers. I recognized a few of their names. In one chamber, Marie and Pierre Curie were buried in adjacent stone coffins. Against Marie Curie’s coffin leaned a small metal placard tied to a rose. The placard was engraved: Je vous admirez Madame Maria Sklodowska-Curie. It was signed by a ten-year-old in 2024.

What a simple story I would tell years later. I went to Paris to see my friend. I went to Paris to find myself. I went to Paris to clatter through the streets on a heavy e-bike and fumble through conversations in French and read the words of a child whose life had once perhaps been changed by the simple story of a woman working in her laboratory many years ago, taking measurements alone at night.

(SEVEN: The city illuminated and alive at night, a street choir singing, buildings twinkling amber above the Seine.) I bought tickets to a jazz club and walked there, crossed the river, wove through a district of glowing dance clubs and bars. I had never been to a jazz club before—had never even really listened to jazz—and didn’t know what to expect, whether my fantastical idea of musicians improvising together in a dimly lit club in the 60s could possibly be realized before my eyes in 2025.

After entering, I nestled with my drink into a seat against the wall of the small brick cave underground where the jam session would be held. Over the next few minutes people crowded against the corners of the room chatting to their friends. Slowly the music started. There was an old man jabbing the synth experimentally in a stuttering, nervous rhythm of high notes. After a few minutes the drummer would shift his pattern, the bassist would follow, the synth would consider for a bit and then begin pressing chords again; finally after fifteen minutes it seemed they had entered a groove, this fast high-energy sprint octave over octave that had the bassist nodding his head and the drummer sweating and smiling and the synth player bending over the keys, rocking back and forth.

Players swapped, a guitarist joined, one saxophonist joined and then another—(the drums went silent suddenly, in the middle of a saxophone run; one of his hi-hats had fallen off; he and the bassist shared a glance, he kept thumping the bass drum while screwing the hi-hat back on, the bassist kept the rhythm meanwhile; finally the drums re-entered)—the music built and built, saxophones soaring together (both of them, you could tell, trying not to smile around their reeds), the synth deciding to glissando down the same time the saxophones climbed up, the drummer’s mouth open in an oh at the punch that resulted, the bassist shaking his head grinning in disbelief, the guitarist’s head jolting up, the gorgeous twenty seconds of symphony that followed, my heart fluttering in my throat, then finally, the saxophone’s high note ending the song. We clapped, cried out, raised our glasses, stomped in passion and joy.

In fewer than 24 hours from that moment in the small brick cave with the sweating musicians and the applauding listeners, I would be on a train to Berlin. In a few days I would bring the Fujifilm disposable camera I’d taken pictures on to CVS and get its film developed, in another week I’ll receive the printed photos and remember moments in Paris that I’m sure I’ve forgotten even now. Maybe then these scenes will coalesce into a story. It’s too simple a story, I know—of a city that lives for passion, for love, for the kind of expression that only comes through intense refinement of your own art—the kind of story you tell small children, or travelers searching for meaning—but still something true lives in the simple story, no less true than the collection of scenes painted side by side.",,0
in a funk,Kanokwan T. '26,4,2025-03-31T00:00:00-04:00,"content warning: mental health, trauma

1

 

I’ve been in a funk. A deep funk.

It took me awhile to notice. A few long months.

 

feels like it snuck up on me

like — ha! — got you

 

distinct from an acute negative event happening then feeling bad afterwards

this is different

this has been a build up

a wave

 

I haven’t felt like myself

normally, I’m pretty jolly and steady

but, there have been persistent thought patterns I’ve experienced

that don’t reflect who I am, nor who I want to be

I’ve made decisions and said things that don’t feel true to my values

everything feels off

 

trauma has its ways of wading in and out of life

it never goes away

it will always be a part of who you are

it just takes on different forms

some quieter and calm

some awfully loud

and all consuming

Last semester, I went through tough times.

things were going on in my personal life

also had a biking accident that resulted in 
        a fractured skull, concussion, and black eye
      


having to miss weeks of classes to recover from both

and everything else in between

 

That was definitely my worst semester in-person at MIT thus far.

 

the weight of the world felt so heavy

i was barely keeping it together

 

I’m proud I made it through relatively okay

and *deeply* grateful for the people that supported me through

my beloved friends

student support services

the fli community

and more

you know who you are

anyways

fast-forward to now: I’m still processing the  fall

I’ve been working really hard to take care of myself.

 

I had a paradigm shift a few weeks ago

shortly after realizing the status of my mental state:

I was super surprised to find that I was feeling… hopeless?

(like, I held the belief that things would not get better)

especially given I’ve endured similarly tough times earlier in life

whilst holding my head high and keeping my heart full

so why was this time so different?

 

the pain of my recent life experiences scratched at me

quietly clawed away at the hope I’ve so deeply held

until one day

I sat with myself, looked inside, and realized

I didn’t have much left

 

I had taken hope for granted

which feels so fucking cheesy to even talk about

but it’s true

 

felt like shit

felt like I let myself down

felt guilty

like, how dare I let myself reach this point?

 

but hey

it happens

this is only natural

and i am human

 

so, after a loooooooooot of emotional work 
        (that could be its own blog),
      


I’ve somehow regained hope.

 

specifically,

the belief that things can get better

and that I have the power to be a part of that change

sounds simple, doesn’t it?

like an empty platitude

almost too obvious

but it isn’t always so

especially in dark, dark times

 

so… that’s huge? and profound? and wonderful?

I’m glad I’ve gotten here

really proud of it, actually

 

with this thread of hope,

the next phase of healing begins:

a dance of soft and firm

 

allowing softness. giving myself grace. letting myself cry, laugh, and be still. eliciting emotions. writing letters i don’t plan to send. forgiving myself for having days that don’t feel right. healing doesn’t always look like action; sometimes, it’s just letting yourself feel. 

implementing firmness. pushing myself to spend time with friends instead of sinking into solitude. building up a healthy habit or two. setting boundaries where I need them. carving out time just to take care of myself. even on the days when it’s simply tough to keep up, being kind to myself—especially then—is a part of healing, too.

I have a quote and poem to share.

quote

“In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.”

“In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.”

poem

fun fact: I know 2 poems by heart, and this is one of them.

“Hope” is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all,
 
And sweetest in the Gale is heard; And sore must be the storm That could abash the little bird That kept so many warm.
 
I’ve heard it in the chillest land, And on the strangest sea; Yet never in extremity, It asked a crumb of me.

“Hope” is the thing with feathers

That perches in the soul,

And sings the tune without the words,

And never stops at all,

 

And sweetest in the Gale is heard;

And sore must be the storm

That could abash the little bird

That kept so many warm.

 

I’ve heard it in the chillest land,

And on the strangest sea;

Yet never in extremity,

It asked a crumb of me.

— Emily Dickinson

 

 

the arc of the human condition is long, but it bends towards hope

I normally blog after I’ve processed something, but perhaps there is value in seeing my undertaking in the raw. This is what the work looks like: messy and tiresome. But, it’s real. It’s happening. And I’m excited to see who I’ll be on the other side.",,0
Thoughts from Science Bowl 🥣,Fiona L. '27,2,2025-03-30T00:00:00-04:00,"“Fiona, next round, you should use your thumb to push the buzzer, not the palm of your hand.”

“Really? I always thought it was faster. It’s, like, a more powerful movement for me. So I do it with more force.”

“Just trust me. It’s a lot much faster with your thumb. Just always keep your thumb above the buzzer, so you’re always ready to buzz in.”

“Okay.”

Apart from that advice, J was silent as we walked through the corridor to the final round. I looked around the room, at the wood paneled walls, the windows rough with light. We didn’t belong here. Everything here was prestigious. Prestigious chairs, prestigious chalkboards, prestigious emergency signs around every corner. We were just a first time team from an unknown high school, blissfully unaware of the cutthroat competition of the South Bay. How our opponents had trained day after day after blistering day, all for just a chance at victory.

Even the air here felt elite, spiced with fog and pine needles and ambition.

Our final round would follow the same routine as all the others. First, an ice breaker. It was meant to make us relax. We had no chance of winning, but when I glanced at my teammates, I saw the determination etched on their faces. I knew that we all looked to bring a piece of this competition home with us, no matter how tiny.

“Who’s your favorite supervillain?”

We buzzed in to give our answers. Four on one side, four on the other, verifying that all the buzzers worked. I was in the “captain” spot on my team, a symbolic position that changed every round. All I needed to do was report our team’s answers for bonus round questions and sign a scoresheet. Yet something about it made the round feel distinct. Crisp, in a way.

“My favorite supervillain is the Joker”

The previous rounds hadn’t gone very well for me. I forgot the answers to questions I found easy during practice, I blurted out the answer before my team position was called, and I gave so, so many wrong answers. In one round, our coach told me to sit out the next round, switching me with our team’s alternate, who was two years my junior.

“My favorite supervillain is my homeroom teacher.”

I had first started attending science bowl meetings because my friend did. These kinds of clubs were rare for my high school, where most students preferred to participate in mock trial, theater, or athletics. We were an unassuming group of nerds gathered in a biology teacher’s classroom, attempting to excel in something we didn’t know the first thing about. But it was fun–to spend my lunches showing off my skills or learning something new or laughing with people I never thought I’d miss so much.

“My favorite supervillain is my dad.”

After that, all it took was a shuffling of hands and papers until the round began. My heart rattled in my chest. Toss up, physics. A question about the centrifugal force–wait, a trick. I knew this. I buzzed in. “A Captain,” the moderator called out. Maybe it really was faster with my thumb. Acknowledged, I could give my answer. “Zero,” I announced. “That is correct.” My heart snagged on the gap between her words. I exhaled a sigh of relief as my teammates celebrated. My team huddled together as we discussed the bonus question I had won for us.

Toss up, energy. Bonus, energy. Toss up, chemistry. Toss up, biology. Toss up, physics. Four points for every toss up, ten for every bonus. The sound of chalk tallying each win and loss. The whole hour went like this, some toss ups successfully granting their team a bonus question. Some toss ups went unanswered, reduced to just a mark on the scoresheet. I buzzed in for question after question, lectures from my AP classes resurfacing in my mind. Imaginary numbers, momentum, Vieta’s formulas. I never thought I’d remember it all.

“A Captain.”

“A Captain.”

“A Captain.”

I remember my position being called over and over, each time bringing a rush of adrenaline into my veins, the moderators opening the floodgates for the pouring of information from my brain, then the knife’s fall of “right” or “wrong”. I felt like one of Pavlov’s dogs. It was exhilarating. Somewhere down the line was at this moment that I realized how badly we wanted it. How badly we all wanted it.

“You answered more questions this round than in all your others combined.” I had barely processed the end of the round. Slowly, my surroundings came into focus: the cold back of my chair, the sweat lining my palms, the biology teacher’s proud expression.

The round ended when I shook the other captain’s hand and signed my team’s scoresheet, all of it a daze as the last thirty minutes played again and again in my mind. Had I really done it? Had I finally broke my streak of bad rounds? 

I looked down at the scoresheet, only examining it closely after I had already signed. There it was. 86 vs. 72. We won.

Author’s note: This post was adapted off of a Vignette I wrote for CMS.587/11.125, Assessing and Evaluating Education. This Vignette was meant to describe a positive assessment experience (where the definition of assessment has been widened from its traditional usage to include recitals, group assignments, and even academic competitions). So, I chose an “assessment that I had a good experience with.” Science bowl. I feel like I’m in such a strange position with my attachment to this extracurricular. I only participated in my senior year. I never became very good at science bowl, nor did I ever go to nationals, yet the memories themselves: of our weekly practices, of our trip to the local competition, at the attempt towards an improbable greatness, still ring more sweet than bitter in my mind, hallmarks of a high school experience I’ll never get back. Science bowl isn’t something I help organize at MIT, nor is it something I talk about or bond over with other MIT students. But it’s something I found fun, and something that I, inadvertently, associate with the simplicity and homeliness of my high school days.",,0
emails to self,Fatima A. '25,6,2025-03-27T00:00:00-04:00,"what a strange feeling it is to be in your last semester at MIT. there is so much i still wish to accomplish, so many classes i never got to take, so many clubs i was never a part of, so many parts of campus i still have not seen and will probably never see.

life lacks closure like always and recently, i find myself trying and then failing to make sense of this remarkable experience and everything that came with it. i know i have more school ahead of me, but it just will not be the same. although on one hand, i am really excited to spend a lot of time on some relatively narrow area of research, i will also miss the opportunities i have had to explore a lot of different things. i will miss being able to go out to observatories and take writing classes and all these weird strange things that i have collected in the last couple of years. now that i am approaching the end of my time here, i finally feel like i am beginning to get the hang of how to be at MIT, how to make the most of the resources here, how to be someone how can let this place change their life. it leaves me yearning for a do-over, a second chance at the past four years. this is probably not an isolated feeling, and probably why some people go to graduate school; it is not a second chance at being at MIT, but it’s the next 
        best
      
 thing, i suppose.

more than anything else, i am terrified of saying goodbye to my friends. though, a lot of my friends have already graduated, there was solace in having this one place where everyone could return to. over the last year, graduated friends spread in many places across the US, have returned, and of course, it is not the same, but it was still so nice to see people occasionally. soon, essentially all of us will be spread in different places, with no one place to call home, and that is slightly terrifying.

over the last couple of years, i had committed a large part of myself to other people around me. i wanted to learn what it means to be a person who thinks and feels and has the urge to create something. what does it mean to create something, what does it mean to live a life, and what does it mean to say that you have done so well? these are all questions that defined my path. i am not sure if i have gathered any answers but i have collected a lot of unique stories and experiences and regrets, which all coagulate into some semblance of thoughts.

i had so much hope for myself and the world as a freshman and sophomore and regrettably, the past two years were very effective in erasing most of it. to some extent, there is the perhaps naive discovery that every step you take is in defiance to a system that is built to oppose you rather than support you. on the other hand, i keep learning just how little i could do to cause the change that i hope to see around me. part of it is simply just that my skill set is not that of someone who can make direct change. 

i think i have made some things that, if not to anyone else, meant something to me. the work of discovery shall carry on, but i can easily say that i have challenged myself in more ways than i would have expected to and i have changed in more ways than i would have expected to.

i grew up with this strange tradition of the long goodbye, lingering near the door, to delay the parting, coming up with new words and stories to tell. there is such sweetness in this, asking so plainly for a little more time. my 4W friends also share this opinion, i assume, because we also tend to deliver the long goodbye every time someone leaves. walking to the door, or the memorial drive side of next (waving at random cars until you get the right one), or to kendall, or sometimes to the airport. 

i am trying to prepare myself for the abrupt goodbye, where one day, we will all get up and leave. yes, we will be in touch, but it will not be the same. something something the joy of living in the same place as your friends. i am greedy to share my life with these people, not just stories from my life. then, there might come a day where we stop talking to each other completely. and for this, no goodbye can be long enough. there is little solace in words. that there is a life to live without the people i discovered my life with—is a heavy feeling. 

as much as i wish for the goodbye to be prolonged, a goodbye that lasts a lifetime, we keep moving onwards, and closer and closer to this checkpoint that will inevitably bring about departures. i feel hopeful and miserable, excited and nervous, very happy and extremely sad, disassociating and overthinking, all at the same time.

in a very eternal-sunshine-of-a-spotless-mind-coded way, i do now think that we will still continue to do the thing, because we are humans. even with the knowledge that we might end up hating each other or drifting apart or losing each other in any form, we will jump back up and repeat it all over again. we will continue to love and care and get our hearts broken and then prepare ourselves for the same old business. it is good to know that hurt is never a strong enough inhibitor for humans, that heartbreak only fuels the want to create something, the want to create a life. so carefully and meticulously. the next couple of years are scary to look forward to, and there will likely be lots of sadness and heartbreak, but it only comes because of the beauty of the life and the people i have found here. the hope, then, is only to keep some shadows of this beauty in memories, in occasional meetups and calls, and to keep going headfirst into the next new thing.

during the fall, i made a mailing list, mostly as a joke, called [friend]iscringe, but i started to use it as a place to send semi-regular life updates. i am not sure there is much to be gained from reading these, but it was fun for me to read them again last week, so here i am presenting some pieces of my life this year. enjoy!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email1-e1742618235721.jpg

Honse.,Andi Q. '25,16,2025-03-26T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m taking a glass sculpting class this semester! And not to brag or anything, but I am incredibly skilled at making glass ponies.

The master at work.

For those of you who don’t know, this is what a pony looks like:

Isn’t she majestic?

Ponies are difficult to sculpt because they have distinctive features that don’t translate well into hot glass – long faces, spindly limbs, and fluffy manes/tails. But because I am so cool and talented, I can easily reproduce these features with photorealistic precision.

This pony’s name is Megan. Born into nobility, she spends her days prancing around regally, refusing to jump over anything less than a gilded fence.

The instructor says she has never seen glass ponies like this before, which I can only assume means that these are the best and most beautiful ponies ever to grace the MIT Glass Lab.

Ebony Affair as a Pre-Frosh,Richard O. '28,1,2025-03-25T00:00:00-04:00,"As a pre-frosh, one thing I really appreciated before coming to MIT was how many programs there were to help students become accustomed to the opportunities, resources, and culture on campus. In particular, programs like CPW and Ebony Affair helped me find friends and communities that I continue to interact with and get support from on a daily basis. Looking back though, I remember being hesitant when deciding on whether or not to attend the Ebony Affair program mostly because I wasn’t sure what it would be like. So with that, I wanted to put together a little recap from my experience last year for any current and future pre-frosh undecided on whether they’ll attend to highlight what the weekend encompasses!

(Check out some photos and videos from Ebony Affair here on the Class of 2028 Instagram and similar content for Sin Limite here!)

 

Friday:

So for a little more context, apart from Campus Preview Weekend (CPW) which is the main get-together for all admitted students, the admissions office hosts several other preview weekends for admits to engage with different communities here on campus like Sin Limite for the Latinx community and Ebony Affair for the Black community. So I ended up attending both CPW and Ebony Affair which happened over back-to-back weekends and got to interact with so many people during both programs!

 

 

So after getting off my plane I was immediately texted by an admissions officer who was waiting by the pick-up zone with another student attending that weekend and we both headed back to campus in an Uber while discussing different food places in Boston. 

From there, we set up base camp in the admissions office where we were met with free food in their conference room while we got to know each other. 

 

 

Once most of the group arrived, we took a walk towards the main building, where we met some staff at the Edgerton Center and built little acrylic lights that we got to keep!

 

 

Next up was Black Graduation which was a celebratory event held in the Stata Center for seniors in the Black Community to get recognized for their hard work and contributions on campus and receive their kente stole for commencement.

During the event we got to hear several inspirational messages and performances from varying groups on campus that left half the lecture hall standing up, clapping along, and just vibing to the live music.

 

From there we returned to the admissions office for dinner and met our hosts for the rest of the weekend. 

 

And it was through my host that I was first really introduced to the Chocolate City community that I’m a part of now.

 

Saturday:

The next morning, the admissions office took us to eat breakfast at a local restaurant called Shy Bird near Kendall Square where we got to meet some professors and talk about our plans heading into MIT. 

 

 

After breakfast we went to the BSU lounge to meet more students in the black community and ask them questions about their experience at MIT. 

Hearing from a panel of students in the BSU lounge

 

From there we pretty much had free reign in what we got to do before the main event for the weekend which was the Ebony Affair Gala held in Walker Memorial for the entire MIT community. So after joining in on a group photo in front of the dome, I ended up joining three other people on a tour of the Jet Propulsion Lab with a grad student and then watched an amazing jump rope performance in the Media Lab. 

 

Group photo!

During the Gala, we got to meet a majority of the Black Community on Campus while hearing from speakers and watching performers accompanied by an awards ceremony and free food!

 

 

Afterward, we pretty much had the last night to ourselves so some of us who were hosted in New House joined in on a movie night held in the New House lobby before getting packed for home. 

 

Sunday: 

So in pretty much no time at all, the weekend had come to an end so we all made our way back to the admissions office that Sunday morning where we received a free breakfast before heading our separate ways on our flights.

And that was a wrap for Ebony Affair! In the span of 3 days, I got to meet people from all over campus while getting a more in-depth sense of what life at MIT would be like as an undergrad. The program also contributed to my decision to choose Chocolate City as my living community for my first year and exposed me to the fun and supportive culture that existed in the house (which I may write more in detail about in the future). So for any pre-frosh considering Ebony Affair this year or in the future, I would highly recommend attending to help familiarize yourself with all the amazing culture, people, communities, and support groups here on campus!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7549-800x600.jpeg

BLOOD MOON FEST IS REAL!!,Ellie F. '28,3,2025-03-22T00:00:00-04:00,"Just over two weeks ago, we dropped our Pi Day announcement with Jebby’s Blood Moon Fest blog post. That night, my roommate Anoushka read the blog and immediately told me that we had to make it real. Despite both of our busy schedules, we started scheming of red pies and balloons and some kind of sacrifice, obviously.

Planning began. What I had was two cans of red spray paint and one can of black (from Bad Ideas Weekend), some red and black balloons, a large flat cardboard box that once held a folding table, a giant BLOOD MOON FEST banner, and access to the Simmons ballpit. What I needed was supplies to make pies, something to hold the food, a sacrifice, and time.

I sent out the dormspam.

you can’t back out once you spam the dorms

A few days later, I decided to buy pre-made red velvet cookie dough instead of making pies. I took a trip to Target, which had the added bonus of being a great excuse to procrastinate studying for my two midterms. I also ordered a pink Among Us pinata on Amazon for the sacrifice. By some stroke of luck, I found a large cookie platter at Infinite Reuse, and so now, we had everything we needed for Blood Moon Fest.

The morning of, Anoushka and I got to work in the kitchen, but waiting for the oven to get ready was a bit boring. I commented on her cool key earrings, and suddenly, we were in the Simmons Crafts Lounge, searching for supplies to make Blood Moon Earrings. We tried melting wax first, but the red seals came out a bit small and nondescript. I went to check on the preheating, and though the oven was a toasty 350 degrees, the cookie tray was too big to fit. I hastily started up the other oven.

I returned to the Crafts Lounge and started scavenging for better earring material. I managed to find four miniature ornaments that we soon tinkered into two pairs of dangling earrings. However, when we victoriously returned to the kitchen, we found that I had somehow failed to preheat the oven, which was instead proclaiming that “Sabbath is on”. Anoushka worked some magic, and eventually we had the cookies in the oven. I rushed over to lunch, and then glassblowing, where I was sniped by Jeremy in all my Blood Moon Regalia.

When the time finally came, I bumped my dormspam, and Anoushka and I hauled all our Blood Moon Inventory to the front of the Stud. As we approached, familiar faces, including Jebby herself, started emerging from the people enjoying the beautiful day. And then, I suddenly realized the aforementioned people were here for Blood Moon Fest. After some Blood Moon Chanting and the indulgence of Blood Moon Cookies, Jebby took the first strike at our Among Us sacrifice, which I had spray-painted red and enhanced with black paint. 

With the lack of any tools, we resorted to variations of stomping, kicking, and throwing the surprisingly resilient pinata. Someone blew up a balloon that we bounced around. A few brave souls took it upon themselves to paint some of the Simmons ballpit balls red in the image of the Blood Moon. More chanting occurred. The Among Us was stabbed. Many things became redder. The cookies were devoured. The event was chaotic and fun and confused many bystanders and it was perfect.

Enjoy a few action shots!

P.S. Neither Anoushka nor I watched the actual Blood Moon. Oops!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blormspam-1000x440.png

one weekend in March,Kai V. '25,1,2025-03-22T00:00:00-04:00,"I’ve been too hosed to write a post that requires beyond-brainstem activity, so instead, enjoy my weekend foray into lifestyle blogging.

Saturday

9:00 a.m. For breakfast I eat cereal and drink jasmine tea. Then I drive with Mira, another pika resident, to a nearby lake. I’ve been feeling pretty stressed and mentally out of it for a few weeks so I’m hoping to be calmed by a swim in cold water. Mira tells me about her past trips to Denmark and the UK, when she encountered lots of people who made cold plunges a habit for the serotonin boost that followed. When we get to the lake shore, it’s just us and the geese under a cloudy sky. We wade in.

It’s the coldest water I’ve ever swum in, but it’s not as bad as I imagined for water a few degrees off freezing. We stay in the shallows, where our feet can still touch the ground, and get out after a few laps. My whole body is physically pulsing with warmth afterwards, and my breathing is slower and more even than usual. I definitely feel calmer and might try to make this a habit in the future.

12:00 p.m. I have leftover shepherd’s pie and an apple with peanut butter for lunch. Then I work on my overdue pset for 6.7800, Inference and Information. The class gives seven allotted late days, so I won’t incur a penalty for turning this in late. But I’m anxious to finish it on time so I can get started on my work for next week.

2:45 p.m. It’s hard to tell whether I’m making progress on the pset. The later problems center on the expectation maximization algorithm, which is a cool way of doing parameter estimation for complicated probability distributions. I’m helping to run a social event for pika later today that needs snacks, so I head to HMart to buy them with house budget. I end up buying a bunch of stuff that’s coincidentally green: wasabi peas, mochi, a matcha swirl cake.

4:00 p.m. The event was slated to start at four, but pika’s stewards have just returned from Costco with our weekly food haul! I help them put away the groceries. pika runs a daily dinner mealplan that anyone can sign up for if they also sign up for a cook or clean shift every 1-2 weeks, and house members also use in-house groceries to make themselves breakfast and lunch. So we get a lot of groceries from Costco to provide for this, a job assigned to our stewards.

4:15 p.m. We run the event: a paint social, where we provide paint, canvases, and brushes, and pikans come paint what they want. We’ve run this once before, and my favorite part is when people who haven’t painted much before join and discover that painting is really fun and relaxing. I work on the same painting that I started last time.

6:30 p.m. House dinner is called!

7:24 p.m. I walk to campus for a performance called As Stars, Our Sacrifices (which Andi Q. ‘25 was in as part of MITWE!) that centers around human-induced environmental damage. It’s really beautiful, and it’s in the new music building which I’ve never entered before today. Embarrassingly, I’m very affected by live orchestral music, so I start crying like four measures in and don’t stop until the end.

10:00 p.m. I arrive back at pika and do more work on my pset.

12:42 a.m. My brain is not really functioning anymore so I go to sleep.

Sunday

5:11 a.m. I get up to finish the pset. Getting up early to finish work is a bit stressful but I’ve never been able to stay up late and remain focused, so waking up before dawn it is. Fortunately I always feel locked in in the morning when no one else is awake.

8:20 a.m. I submit the pset! Then I shower and start reading the report I have to critique for 8.14, Experimental Physics II (the sequel to Junior Lab). In the spirit of peer review, each of us has to read a past student’s work and write a referee report. The paper I’m assigned is about observing 
        hyperfine structure
      
 using 
        Doppler-free spectroscopy
      
, which makes me really happy: I think, in another life, I’m an experimental atomic physicist. In fact, I definitely would have tried to angle myself towards grad school for atomic physics if I’d learned about it earlier. As it stands, I had no idea what it entailed until my junior spring when I took a graduate 
        AMO
      
 class on a whim, and by then it felt too late to reroute my entire undergrad towards an atomic physics PhD. I’m happy where I am, but I don’t feel as excited by anything else in science, so it makes me wonder sometimes what could have been. Anyway—this is all to say that I had a wonderful time doing the assignment!

12:20 p.m. I wander downstairs where people are chatting after brunch. Someone has made a giant tray of vegan blueberry muffins. I eat like six of them. Then I have to do my SHITs (Sunday House Improvement Tasks, the one-hour-per-week obligation for each pikan to do some cleaning task to keep the house tidy), so I grab some bleach and toilet cleaner and scrub down the bathroom on my floor.

3:10 p.m. Yesterday was a pika resident’s birthday; today, she is holding a celebratory tea party! She offers us Chinese white tea, cucumber finger sandwiches, and home-baked cookies. Some people queue up to play the piano in the background. Someone eats a whole avocado like an apple (yes, including the pit—they just bite into it, which I didn’t know was possible). I curl up on the corner of the couch and work on debugging code for my UROP.

6:15 p.m. We have dinner and then our weekly house meeting.

9:15 p.m. Some pikans start watching Severance, so I join them for a couple of episodes. It’s really good!

11:30 p.m. I wonder if it was worth sinking two hours into Severance when I have a bunch of work due tomorrow. It’s okay: 
        I’ll get up early to do it.",,0
“we have the winter olympics at home”,Allison E. '27,1,2025-03-22T00:00:00-04:00,"When I say that snow was a statistically significant factor in my choice of MIT, I mean it. I’m on a mission to spread the New England winter propaganda, and that means more snow shenanigans! This time brought to you by my friend Siyi C. ‘26, a fellow winter enthusiast who occasionally summons me at 10:00 pm to accompany her on the most random and hilarious shenanigans.

Exhibit A:

On the last day of finals, as if to celebrate the vanquishing of our most sinister adversaries exams, we received a glorious dump of snow. Even better, right outside of the dorm where Siyi and I live is Briggs Field, the massive recreational field separating dorm row (where most of MIT’s undergrad dorms are) from Simmons Hall and several of the graduate dorms. Compared to the urban landscape that is the Boston-Cambridge area, it’s practically a gold mine for snow-related activities, including but not limited to… cross-country skiing!

 

Exhibit B:

We also had a very snowy February (HOORAY!!), and the weather lords topped off their grand finale with several inches of snow, followed immediately by 10 straight hours of rain, then a full night of sub-freezing temperatures. It left campus in… an interesting state, but more importantly, it left Briggs field covered in a thick layer of pure ice. Sections of it were covered in footprints or were slightly bumpy, but several semi-smooth spots remained for… ice skating!!

idk how Siyi didn’t eat it on the rough ice LOL, it was uneven to not be slippery, despite my sneakers’ tread being absolutely destroyed","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20241220_175728_Original-800x600.jpeg

concord market is finally here!!!!!,Emiko P. '25,3,2025-03-21T00:00:00-04:00,"The day I’ve been waiting for has finally arrived.

For over 20 years, the Student Center housed an MIT treasure: LaVerde’s, our beloved on-campus grocery store.
 Sadly, in the winter of my sophomore year, LaVerde’s permanently closed its doors.

The months passed. Students who had loved LaVerde’s graduated, and new freshman arrived to MIT, never having felt the warmth and tenderness (and blow to the wallet) of an on-campus grocery store.

With LaVerde’s closure, the bustling grocery store on the first floor of the Stud turned into a boarded up, blank wall of plaster. It was sad, but the heartbreak was eased because we were promised a new store: Concord Market.

Since then, over two years passed. To tell you the truth, it seemed as if all hope was lost. I thought I would graduate and never get to lay eyes on Concord Market. I thought my on-campus grocery store dreams were over: no more quick lunches in between classes, no more much-needed energy drinks on test day, no more yummy snacks to gift my soccer teammates. I had accepted that this would just have to be my reality.

Until…

The grand opening of Concord Market on March 11, 2025!

I walked into the Stud one morning, over two years after I had last eyes on LaVerde’s, to see a beautiful sight in front of me: a crowd of students coming in and out of a bustling grocery store with a huge CONCORD MARKET sign. I almost couldn’t believe my eyes – Concord Market was finally, miraculously here!

We

are

so

back

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I knew instantly that I would have to explore this new grocery store, so here I am, a week or so later, ready to see what Concord Market has in store for us!

After walking around through every single aisle and getting our bearings, we decided to start collecting items for a Concord Market feast. There were so many things to choose from, but we all ended up grabbing some lunch as well as some materials for a charcuterie board!

After we selected all of our items, we went up to the register, and we got to take an extra-special VIP picture with the head of Concord Market behind the register!



With our food purchased, we set about preparing our Concord Market feast. Maddie L. ’26 came over to sit with us, where she revealed that she had actually just won the Concord Market raffle! She got 50 bucks and a freezer bag of food that must’ve weighed 15 pounds.

After we absolutely demolished our charcuterie board and lunch, we reflected on our Concord Market experience together. Here are some thoughts:

“I’ve been waiting for this since sophomore year, and it didn’t disappoint. The staff is lovely and very friendly. Lots of good charcuterie options. 9/10.” – Lauren D. ’25.

“Concord Market has a lot of good cheese. I’m from Wisconsin. I love cheese so much.” – Lauren again.

“The next two years are about to be a movie. 8/10.” – Maddie S. ’27 (a sophomore, who is lucky to be able to enjoy Concord Market for many years to come).

“I think Concord Market lived up to the expectations. While the wait was long, dare I say it was worth it? 8/10.” – Natalie B. ’25.

“Lowkey expensive tho.” – Nat again.

“It was baller. There is much pain in the world, but not in Concord Market.” – Maddie L. ’26



Thank you for opening before I graduate. I love you, Concord Market. <3","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG-20250321-WA0002-800x600.jpg

[Guest Post] Small-Town and Rural Students take on MIT and Boston,Nicole Cooper,1,2025-03-20T00:00:00-04:00,"Bringing STARS to Campus: Reflections on our first STARS@MIT Fly-In As we gear up for the second STARS (Small-Town and Rural Students)@MIT Fly-In program this fall, we’re reflecting on the incredible success of our inaugural event. Last fall, we welcomed our first group of high school juniors specifically from rural and small-towns to experience life at MIT and gain insights into the college application process—through the unique lens of being from a small-town or rural community.  

As part of our commitment to expanding college access to small-towns and rural students through the STARS College Network, 32 institutions across the country, including MIT (a founding member), are launching programs to bring students to campus and help them envision themselves in these spaces. Instead of just telling you how impactful this experience was, we want you to hear directly from one of our STARS Ambassadors, Vaneeza—a current MIT student who played a key role in planning the weekend and hosting one of our visiting students. While we work behind the scenes to open applications and plan for the Fall 2025 STARS@MIT Fly-In, take a moment to read about the program from Vaneeza’s perspective! 

Building Connections through Shared Small-Town ExperiencesIn October, MIT Admissions hosted its first STARS@MIT Fly-in program, bringing 20 high school juniors from small and rural towns nationwide to MIT for a three-day visit to learn about the college application process, MIT, and attending school in an urban environment. As one of the STARS Ambassadors, I helped plan and host activities during their visit.

My fellow STARS Ambassadors and I met the visiting students on the first evening and played a game of “Rural Students Bingo,” in which we try to fill a bingo card by finding people with different interests and backgrounds, ranging from traits like having grown up on a farm to liking sci-fi movies. This was a fun way for us to break the ice and learn a little about each other before spending the next two days together. At dinner afterwards, we got a chance to really sit down and get to know each other; I learned about the students’ lives at their schools, and we got to tell them about our experiences at MIT. It was amazing to chat with the students about everything from their research projects plans and internships opportunities, to even just living in the city. These conversations were a great precursor for what followed throughout the weekend: an exchange of lifestyles and goals through the lens and trust of a shared background.

Navigating New Environments

Throughout the program, the visiting students impressed me; this was such a new environment, and for many this was the first time flying on a plane, riding a subway, or just being away from home. The way they embraced the new experiences with excitement to learn, insightful questions, and eagerness to explore was incredible to see.The admissions office hosted workshops on how to balance academic and social goals with financial considerations in the college search process (it’s hard to do!) and how to showcase strengths such as resilience, community involvement, and other characteristics often found in small-town and rural communities in their applications. Our goal for the program is to really teach the students that they have so much to offer their future college communities!

A key part of finding success in the college search and application process for rural students is also gaining the confidence that they can navigate their future campus environment. So why not adventure around the city we call home? In small groups, we took the students to the famous historical Beacon Hill via a public transportation tutorial. I remember when I first came to MIT that the T was this scary mysterious thing that I was afraid to learn

to use. I had never lived in a place with any kind of public transportation, and the thought of doing the wrong thing or getting on the wrong train was terrifying. Now I know the T is a great luxury that provides a ticket off campus that is both affordable and easily accessible, and it was really lovely getting to share that experience with the visiting students. We walked through Beacon Hill and Boston Common in what had to be the nicest weather October has ever seen and got to showcase the beauty and history of the area. This was a highlight of the weekend for me because I got to explore the city in a way I never had before and share the experience with students who were so excited about every new thing we saw. Discovering BelongingThroughout the visit, there were lots of opportunities to build strong connections with the students and help make our campus feel like a home. One way I got to do this was by hosting a student in my dorm. Having a student spend the weekend with me meant that we had

plenty of time to talk about all sorts of things, from new hobbies we were learning to crazy hometown tales. I also got to show them around my dorm, Simmons Hall, and how we have built a community of our own here. Since Simmons is a place where we encourage drawing on the walls, my visiting student got to leave some artwork of their own, physically cementing their place in this community. Having this time to get to know one of the students on a more personal level was wonderful because I got to share some of my favorite parts of my

community with them and hopefully show them how easily a campus can feel like a home.

At the end of the jam-packed weekend, the STARS Ambassadors hosted an MIT scavenger hunt where students used what they learned over the past two days to navigate campus more independently, hitting landmarks like the Banana Lounge, Killian Court, and the Borderline Murals. It was super fun to see the students confidently find their way after such a short time, which I hope is a sign that they enjoyed being on campus. Watching all the students work together to solve the clues and have a good time also showed me the sense of community and friendships they had formed with each other. This helped me realize that beyond finding belonging on our campus, these students now also have a community amongst themselves which they can lean on during their college application process and beyond. They can support each other knowing they each understand each other’s backgrounds and the goals they hope to achieve.



STARS discover campus during scavenger hunt Lasting Impact

One conversation that stood out to me was halfway through the program when I asked a group of students how they were liking the visit and if they thought they might attend a school like MIT in the future. Everyone said they were having a good time, but one student had decided this was not the environment they were looking for during college. That was a reminder of how important these types of programs are beyond learning how to strengthen applications or how to navigate a city; this student was now able to make a more informed choice about where he wanted to spend the next four years. Even if they decided the city was not for them, they would never be left wondering “what if?” and that is why I am so happy to have been a part of this program–because we are able to share perspectives and experiences that these students so often don’t get the chance to experience in high school, especially from these small-town backgrounds where many people rarely leave their state.I enjoyed helping host this visit for many reasons. It was great to meet prospective students and see them excited about starting the next chapter of their lives. I was also super impressed by how open they were to exploring the area and talking with us and each other because I know how scary moving into this new type of environment can be. Seeing the students also reminded me of how much I’ve learned and grown since being on campus, and it was very fulfilling to see such deserving students get a chance to explore college in a way that has been historically unavailable to so many from small-town and rural backgrounds and start that journey themselves. Overall, I am so grateful to have been a part of this inaugural program not only because it was so fun to meet and host students and share my new home with them, but also because I got to see the impact this type of program is having on students by showing them that their perspectives are valued on our campus and by hopefully showcasing that they have so many great options for their futures.

MIT Dining Halls,Aiden H. '28,6,2025-03-19T00:00:00-04:00,"One of my biggest plights with MIT is how, since they kinda know that people will always want to apply/commit, there isn’t as much of a need to wow students as there is with a state school or a small liberal arts college, per se. We don’t need to spend the money on a huge, beautiful quad, seasonal flowers, pretty architecture, AC in dorms, or just generally 
        any good sense of spatial planning.
      
 As much as I don’t want to admit it, I do want these “superficial” things for comfort and vibe.

Accordingly, MIT lies in this awkward liminal space between having some of the nicest amenities and facilities, and some pretty awful ones. Arguably, the most talked about is campus dining/food. MIT has historically been a food desert, Cambridge/Boston isn’t necessarily a “campus town”, so surrounding restaurants are adult-expensive and not college-kid-expensive, and the Stud’s years of renovations have taken and replaced a bunch of campus restaurant and grocery staples. This leaves a lot of the undergrad populations to eat at the (in)famous dining halls.

I find it fairly obvious which dining halls are better than others, but the overall inconsistency of dining leaves me and my roommates arguing about where we should eat to have the highest probability of having something we could actually enjoy instead of just tolerate. Therefore, I find it appropriate to provide my official ranking so as to close any debate around the subject.

I will be using the following criteria:

- Quality – This is most important. How is the food? Have I heard of anyone getting food poisoning here?

- Quantity – How many options are there? How accessible are dining options to different diets?

- Distance (vaguely) – From what I’m deeming an arbitrary “middle of campus” where the most undergraduates would be at any time. Pretty much, how far from the Stud/Kresge/Z area?

- Staff – Are the staff nice? Do they look miserable?

- Vibes/ambiance – Can I eat here without feeling sad? Was there any effort in the decor/design?

With that, I present my ranking:

 

AAAA! AAAA! Don’t make me eat here, it makes me sad.

Quality: ⭐⭐ – Everything I’ve ever had here was really dry. Nothing was inedible or super disgusting, and it might have just been a menu thing, but I’ve never like anything here.

Quantity: ⭐ – This is the reason McCormick is so low for me. Even though other dining halls have comparable quality, McCormick is wayyyy too small. There’s pretty much only ever two options for a meal and then the salad bar (which isn’t nearly as decked out as other dining halls). Committing to McCormick is committing to one meal.

Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – McCormick is generally close enough to most of campus that it’s accessible to pretty much everyone without complaint, except maybe Simmons/Next, but these have their own dining halls so I can’t imagine anyone walking specifically for McCormick dining.

Staff: N/A – Didn’t have any interaction with any staff.

Vibes: ⭐ – The dining area is way too cramped for seating and the kitchen can only really fit people in a single-file line. Very elementary-school cafeteria vibe. I don’t get claustrophobic in an anxiety way, but I do get claustrophobic in an I’m-hot-asf-and-need-you-to-shut-up-so-we-can-get-out-of-here passive- aggressive way. McCormick does not trigger a good side of me.

 

Maseeh (C)

Quality: ⭐⭐ – Maseeh is notorious for having the most questionable quality. Although I would argue that Masseh has been marginally better for lunch this semester than last, it is pretty undeniable. Because Maseeh is closest to class buildings, it’s a much more popular option for lunch than for dinner. This shows in the quality. Dinner is back-and-forth between pretty good and bowl-of-green-sludge. Maseeh has no “middle”–it’s either good or bad, and statistically it feels a little to that lower side.

Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5 – Maseeh is one of the biggest, if not the biggest dining hall on campus. It also has the largest dedicated kosher station and a guaranteed “Indian” food section that has to have a vegetarian and/or vegan option. Basically, Maseeh always has the following options:

- Grill (not live grill, which we’ll see in other dining halls, but still burgers and the like)

- Comfort (generally Indian food or some mix of veggies/potatoes/meat)

- Oasis (a bowl station where they serve you in a mini-Chipotle way)

- Global (another bowl station, just with something else)

- Pizza

- Southwestern/Pasta (this is only pasta, no one knows what Southwestern means. Southwest of what?)

- Salad Bar

- Omelet Station (breakfast/brunch only)

Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – As aforementioned, Maseeh is on Mass Ave. right next to the Stud and the class buildings, so it is pretty accessible, which makes it the main draw for people who don’t live in Maseeh to eat here.

Staff: ⭐⭐ – Half of the staff are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. The other half like to actively insult the other chef’s food in some sort of weird pissing contest, which just leaves students standing there as they talk about how the food we’re eating sometimes looks like sewage.

Vibes: ⭐⭐⭐ – Maseeh has some of the most seating and some bay windows, which doesn’t make it completely ugly. Still, it’s not the cleanest as a building and I’ve only ever seen mice while eating in Maseeh.

tl;dr you’ll probably eat here for lunch, check the dining website menu before considering dinner

 

Baker (C)

Quality: ⭐⭐⭐ – Baker might not have better meals necessarily, but it is much more consistent than a dining hall like Masseh. I’ve never seen anything sludge-like.

Quantity: ⭐⭐ – Similar to McCormick, Baker only ever has two options, and a lot of the time they’re the same thing. However, Baker does have the grill and stir-fry stations, where you can get food made-to-order (burgers, quesadillas, stir-fry). The grill helps Baker a lot, but it can get pretty repetitive and not healthy.

Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – Baker is kind of the exact middle dorm on the south/river side. No one has ever complained about walking to Baker.

Staff: ⭐⭐.5 – Not a lot of notable staff interactions, but sometimes the grill and stir-fry workers can take a really long time to make orders and then end up messing them up. This is fair because they’re definitely overworked and underpaid, but it also does mean that I’ve waited 30 minutes for a quesadilla that they ended up putting chicken in (I’m a vegetarian).

Vibes: ⭐⭐ – Baker has two floors of eating which is pretty cute. The tables and chairs are unnecessarily uncomfortable though, all being this rounded, shiny plastic wood. The lighting is also a little off and ventilation is low, so it’s a pretty humid experience.

 

Simmons (B) 

Quality: ⭐⭐⭐.5 – I don’t eat at Simmons that often, but I’ve never had anything bad. They also have jalapeño poppers that I devour.

Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐ – Simmons does have a smaller-sized dining hall, which is weird considering its size. There are typical 2 meal options, but then still a full salad bar, grill, and stir-fry, so it’s not as deprived as something like McCormick.

Distance: ⭐ – Simmons is at the far end of west campus on the north side. If you don’t live at Simmons, you’re not going to walk past every other dining hall option for something that isn’t that notable.

Staff: ⭐⭐⭐ – Nothing of note. There is an issue with getting a dishwasher, though, so I think it’s been only paper plates and utensils for a while?

Vibes: ⭐⭐ – The dining area is extremely tight and crowded, and, in typical Simmons fashion, the lighting is so awful you can’t see anything. Oh, and it’s that weird concrete again, 
        because duh.
      


 

Next (A) 

 

Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – It’s rare that something here is actually disgusting (minus that one time it was apple cider tofu). More consistent than other dining halls, but there is a lot of repetition, notably with the vegetarian options (tofu and rice, basically).

Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐ – I would say Next and Simmons have the same amount of food options. Two meals, a grill, stir-fry, salad bar, and then the typical breads/toaster/soup/cereal combo that everything has.

Distance: ⭐ – Same as Simmons, it’s on the far end, just on the south/river side. Nevertheless, it’s not that bad of a walk, and I eat dinner at Next more often than anywhere else. In the harsh winds of IAP, skipping Next is understandable. When it’s nice out? I think some (most) MIT students just hate walking and need to figure that out lol

Staff: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – The Next House dining staff are maybe the most famously nice? There are two guys specifically, one on grill and one on stir-fry, who go out of their way to make conversation and are just generally nice/approachable instead of offering a blunt “What do you want” (or the even more common dining hall worker stare, in which they don’t address you at all and just expect you to start talking).

Vibes: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – BOOTHS! Next dining has booths that overlook the river, making it by far the most comfortable dining hall. One star off for the bad lighting and overall Next House vibes though.

Next will always be a solid choice, and if I was making someone non-MIT try a dining hall, it would definitely be Next.

 

New Vassar (A)



Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5 – A similar argument to others, but Vassar is just more consistent and you know what you’re going to get going in. Vassar has a more American-leaning focus than some other dining halls like Maseeh, which try to have more global foods. For dinner, Vassar always has a grill section with a bunch of premade burgers, chicken, onion rings, fries, etc. that are better than other grill sections. For breakfast, Vassar also has the best omelet station because they let students cook their own omelets, and they have actual whole eggs (so that you could do fried/scrambled eggs as an alternative, which is not available at other dining halls because they use the liquid eggs only), and sometimes do a special waffle bar with various fruity and sweet toppings. .5 off though, because in my heart I cannot say it is restaurant quality, and I’m never foaming at the mouth to eat here.

Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – There is a dedicated vegan section on top of the regular 2-3 hot meals prepared, along with the grill, stir-fry, and impressive salad bar (see: Salad Bar rank below). Vassar also has some unique foods that other dining halls don’t always have (sunflower butter, more types of jam/jelly, more types of pastries available every day instead of sporadically).

Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – Vassar is right behind the Z, making it not far from anything, but only really “close” to Simmons.

Staff: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – I don’t know what they’re giving these people but sometimes they can be too nice. I’ve had people at the vegan station practically bless me and my family when I ask for food.

Vibes: ⭐⭐⭐ – I heard New Vassar used to be a parking garage, and I can’t unsee it. The vibe of the whole building, inlacing the dining hall, is very sterile. The chairs and tables are also mildly uncomfortable, but not unbearable. Being a bigger dorm though, there is ample space and seating.

*SPECIAL* Salad Bar: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – Vassar wins on the salad bar. It has the largest salad bar, the most dressing options, and the most interesting options. The salad bars in other dining halls are mostly just random cut-up vegetables, which means your only option is some type of lettuce, bell peppers, shredded carrots, and cucumber. Vassar has all this, but then actually puts out interesting stuff (a premade salsa, seasoned tofu, feta or blue cheese, a Japanese cucumber salad instead of cucumbers, etc.).

 

That’s the end of my ranking. I’ve had a fair share of struggles with adjusting to the dining hall food, so I definitely recommend trying a lot of options if you get a chance.

(Still not as bad as Harvard though.)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maseeh-800x541.jpg

speaker talks and gallery shows,Gloria Z. '26,3,2025-03-18T00:00:00-04:00,"This semester, I’ve really been trying to take advantage of MIT’s deep well of events: book talks, participatory activities, gallery openings, film screenings… the list goes on! 
        SHASS
      
, 
        DUSP
      
, and the Architecture department tend to host or promote a lot of these events, in addition to more large-scale happenings at the List Center for the Arts, the Wiesner student gallery, and the MIT Museum. While MIT is known primarily for the T in Technology, it also has a super vibrant and scholarly humanities and arts scene, particularly in disciplines like comparative media studies, urban planning, history of architecture, etc. For example, did you know that DUSP is home to the largest urban planning faculty in the United States?? There’s also a graduate program in science writing, a degree specializing in Islamic architecture, research labs in experimental new media art, etc… I entered MIT perceiving its graduate research sphere as a place filled primarily with advanced scientific endeavors–and that it has, but it also has so much more.

These corners of the school tend to be less undergraduate-heavy, populated primarily by researchers and professors in the specific department. Their events, though, are usually open to all MIT affiliates, and when I find pockets of time to check them out, I always find them extremely valuable and interesting. So–in the past month or so, here’s what I’ve seen!

The Great Learning exhibition preview

feb 12; by Pedro Gómez-Egaña; at the List Center

As part of an on-campus program called MIT Arts Scholars, we get exclusive access to arts events in the greater Boston area, including performances, artist talkbacks, and lectures. This was one such event: we had the opportunity to preview Gómez-Egaña’s show, The Great Learning, which he was setting up in the List Arts Center. It was super inspiring to see a large-scale installation in the midst of construction, as the artist was still making decisions about what to include, where to put things, and how viewers would interact with the space–in the midst of the creative process.

official image taken from the List Center website

From the website description: “[Gómez-Egaña draws] on practices of composition and choreography to create dynamic constellations of objects and events in time.” Without spoiling too much, I especially loved his use of slow, measured movement using magnets and physical systems; definitely encourage seeing the show before it closes in July.

Too Much Fun: The Five Lives of the Commodore 64 Computer book talk

feb 25; by Jesper Juul (game designer + theorist); hosted by the CMS/W department and the MIT Press

In this book talk, Juul gave an overview of, in his eyes, the five ways the 
        Commodore 64 computer
      
 has influenced games, digital culture, and the world at large. I’m really fascinated by retro tech and games (any Pico-8 fans in the chat), so I had to pull up. It’s really interesting how portable computers were marketed back before they became ubiquitous, as tools for connectivity or machines for gaming or otherwise, and I feel like those patterns mirror the way that new personal tech (like biometrics wearables or VR gadgets) are advertised nowadays.

they had some actual Commodore 64 computers there!!! I need to get my hands on a CRT monitor asap…

Necessity: Climate Justice & The Thin Green Line film screening

feb 27; part of the Women Take The Reel film festival; hosted by the WGS department (& other schools’ departments)

I went to this event (and most of the other ones in this list lol) with my friend Sabine! It was part of a free film festival that’s hosted by a variety of Women’s and Gender Studies departments across universities, focusing on 1) issues relating to gender, race, sexuality, class, feminism and 2) films directed by women.

This particular film focused on the stories of climate activists in the Pacific Northwest as they fought legal battles and resisted the encroachment of oil trains and spills throughout their land. It was interesting to see the legal basis they argued on–the necessity defense; and the story ended well. I find it hard a lot of the time to fight climate doomerism/pessimism though, maybe due to lack of information, so I’m trying to learn more, and this is part of that.

i only have a picture of the poster

Measures and Meanings of Spatial Capital book talk

mar 3; by Lars Marcus (Swedish architect + professor in urban design); hosted by DUSP

In this talk, Marcus discusses his research and recently published book on what he calls “spatial capital.” Essentially, he argues that land has been disregarded in contemporary urban/economic studies as a fundamental production factor alongside labor and capital (money). Thus, we must effectively model and synthesize spatial data alongside other forms of data in order to effectively address social and environmental issues.

I think this is more salient than ever as the US faces a critical housing shortage and the world condenses (more than half of the world’s population now live in urban areas :0), and I liked the segments where he discussed ways of actually quantifying spatial metrics through geometry and map data. Also they had really good Mediterranean food!

very cool maps

Future Type exhibition

mar 4; at the MIT Museum

This mini-show was put on by Future Sketches, a research group in the Media Lab that explores technology and computation as mediums for art and design. Specifically, Future Type featured their work related to typography and letterforms. This semester, I’m taking a class taught by Zach Lieberman, who leads Future Sketches, so we just went to see the show as a class and he (& the TAs) talked about the technical details behind some of the work on display. It was very cool!! I really want to try making interactive/projected media of my own. I’m dumb and didn’t take any photos/videos so uhh… have an Instagram link instead :D.

Homes for Living: The Fight for Social Housing and a New American Commons book talk

mar 10; by Jonathan Tarleton; hosted by DUSP

This talk was structured as a conversation between Jonathan Tarleton (a DUSP alum) and Justin Steil (a law/planning professor in DUSP). Tarleton discussed his recent book, which traces the stories of two social housing co-ops in New York City as they contemplate potential financial and social changes. It includes interesting questions pertaining to property ownership and social obligations to our communities and future generations. I feel like homeowning has been sold for so long as the last destination on the American Dream Journey™, a prospect which feels more and more out of reach as real estate prices soar, so it was enlightening to hear his thoughts on how and why social housing programs like these can succeed at all levels.

you can kind of see them at the front

Books and Bites: Exploring Technovernacular Creativity

mar 11; at Rotch Library; hosted by MIT Libraries

I went to this same event last year and it was really cool! Basically, MIT Libraries featured some curated selections from their Distinctive Collections. They had art books, tarot cards, experimental print media, and just generally interesting art objects. I especially enjoyed this piece by Rhiannon Skye Tafoya:

The weaving techniques are so beautiful and remind me of some of the pixel-manipulation artwork we looked at in my creative computation class (the one w/ future sketches) recently:

by Ken Knowlton (I couldn’t find the name of the work)

info session on architecture licensure 

mar 11; hosted by MIT Architecture + NCARB (National Council of Architectural Registration Boards)

This info session detailed the exact requirements for getting licensed as an architect, which is what 1) allows you to call yourself an architect 2) allows you to “stamp” or greenlight designs and 3) allows you to start your own firm. Turns out, the process is way more extensive than I thought: after completing an 
        accredited
      
 B.Arch or M.Arch, you then need to complete 3,740 hours (!!!) of on-the-job experience and take six multi-hour standardized tests covering different aspects of architectural practice. Only then can you call yourself an architect. I guess it makes sense–a lot of things fall under the purview of an architecture firm, from construction/budget management to minute design details, so it’s probably good to only allow experienced professionals to make literal buildings. Plus, you can still work at an architectural firm, e.g. as a staff designer, you just can’t be the principal on a project or something like that. But still – damn!!

i only took a picture of the sandwiches oops. they were good though, from cafe luna

guest lecture by font design collective, Bye Bye Binary

mar 17; hosted as part of 4.14; over Zoom

4.14 is a class about typography and translation, taught by Bo-Won Keum, a graphic designer and lecturer in the architecture department. I took it last spring, when it was offered under a different course number (4.s00), so when she pubbed this year’s guest lecture over email, I decided to listen in on the Zoom. It was super 
        cool
      
–Bye Bye Binary is a French-Belgian art collective, working primarily in type, but also performance, writing, and general graphic design. Through their work, they try to construct a more inclusive and “post-binary” version of the French language, which is historically very gendered, while challenging traditional notions of what constitutes good design. I really liked this slide from their presentation:

:-)

Burhan Azeem (Cambridge city councilor) lunch talk

mar 17; hosted by DUSP

For some context, Cambridge 
        recently
      
 passed the biggest zoning modification in the city’s history, creating one of the most progressive zoning codes nationwide. In short, they adopted multifamily zoning citywide, replacing a complex patchwork of complex regulations and mostly single-family zoning. This is a big deal!! In this talk, Burhan Azeem (actually an MIT alum in course 3) detailed his efforts over the past 5+ years to help push through this legislation, both as a city councilor and community organizer. It was really fascinating to hear him speak about the political side of things, such as strategies to convince constituents and other councilors of the merits of the new code, as well as ways these changes could reverberate in other Boston-area municipalities.

👍

& that’s all! Hopefully as the semester fully ramps up I’ll still have the bandwidth to make it to talks like these; I think having access to the graduate programs’ resources and events is a really valuable part of MIT’s undergraduate education, and it helps expose me to so many new ideas and areas of study. :-)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mit-list-pedro-gomez-egana_the-great-learning_0225_0039.jpg-800x600.webp

MIT Regular Action Decisions Now Available Online,Chris Peterson SM '13,0,2025-03-14T00:00:00-04:00,"MIT Regular Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2029 are now available in the application portal. To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking View Update. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update. 

This year — inclusive of both Early and Regular Action — 29,282 students applied to join the MIT Class of 2029. As of (checks watch) right now, we have 
        offered admission
      
 to 1,324 students who have the opportunity to collectively climb the mountain that is MIT. 

These 1,324 students hail from all 50 states, 62 countries, and nearly a thousand different high schools. Though their interests and aptitudes range widely — cosmology and cosplay, quantum and quilting, agriculture and archery — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with MIT’s mission to use science, technology, and other areas of scholarship to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind. We can’t wait to welcome them to convocation in Cambridge this fall, where they will join the ~4,500 outstanding undergraduates who already call MIT home.

There are also students who may be climbing other mountains, with other fellow mountaineers, next fall. Of the students to whom we do not offer admission today, we have placed a modest number on our waitlist and informed the balance that we will not be able to admit them to the Class of 2029. Getting to “meet” so many capable, compassionate students through this process has, as always, left us bleary-eyed and reminded us that what we do is more than a job: it is a privilege and an honor. We are grateful to have walked this short part of your path with you. 

If you are among the many stellar students to whom we are not offering admission, then I want to remind you success is not always a straight line. Your future isn’t something MIT creates for you, it’s something you manifest for yourself. And if you spend the next few years trying to make wherever you are as amazing as you can (as you already are), then someday you’ll look back on this Pi Day and realize it all worked out okay.

I’m closing comments on this blog post to concentrate conversation in the open threads for admitted, waitlisted, and not admitted students. Answers to frequently asked questions for waitlisted students can be found here, with more information about next steps to come in early April. 

Congratulations to the Class of 2029, and best wishes to all of our applicants. No matter where you enroll next fall, please make it a better place. I know you can. I hope you will.",,0

Open Thread: Waitlisted,Decisions,14,2025-03-14T00:00:00-04:00,"A lot of students applied to MIT this year, and unfortunately, we just couldn’t accept them all. We have placed a small number of students on the waitlist. If you would like to be considered for the waitlist, or you want to learn more about it, you can read more here.

Waiting can be tough because it feels like there’s nothing that you can do, but—if you look beyond the thing you’re waiting for—it can also be full of unexpected growth. We adapt and continue onward.

Out and about in the fog at the edge of the world,Uzay G. '26,1,2025-03-13T00:00:00-04:00,"I like standing at the edge, stopping there and looking down at the valley till my breath comes back. Feeling the world come to life. Seeing the raw scale of man fill my view only when I choose to see it. Seeing the world always, overwhelming with its color. Do you feel in your bones that insane color jumping off the cyan water trickling down the peak or the sun beating down your temples as you run up against it?

 I’ve been standing at the edge a lot recently. Or maybe it always seems that way but just in different hues. I’ve been traveling for the last month around the world – it’s been ethereal and intense and beautiful. And now I just started an exchange back in Paris.

It’s a moment of cultural reckoning, 3 months to settle back and see what it’s like being here and meeting other young people doing similar stuff as an actual student. When I chose to go to MIT 3 years ago, I made a choice. And then I kept making choices over and over. And sometimes I would look at myself in the mirror and wonder: is this who I am?

Sometimes an old woman says that life is like a leaf in a stormy void. It floats against the shape of the world, makes some jumps and not some others, finds itself somewhere else, and keeps going, and someday you wake up and look around and hopefully know where you are. Maybe soaked and shriveled or plunged in dirt or laying your life down in the sunlight of a suburb. I chose to do this exchange, because I wanted to jump back up in the sky and say, no! I can’t let go let me see all the leaves rolling in the wind, I don’t know where I will land yet!!!

Last month I chose to teach some people math & ML & talk about dreams in the face of a moonlight mountain while drinking tea. And I chose to go to a city nearby and taste that heavenly sweet potato with the sesame paste on top. For a few hours I felt the city move and I followed its slanted curve and talked to some of its people and they told me about their worries and we shared something at the top of an abnormally large tower looking down on the world, an edge jutting out into the sky, nestled between forest and concrete.  I felt raw beauty in this place I would probably never come back to again, if there is one to come back to.

Then I went to a nearby land that I like and I walked around a lot. I walked and thought and looked and stood at the edge and listened. I chose to walk alone and listen to the sound of silence, and I chose to splice work in my moments of exploration, like the fictional man who brings a tupperware of salad to pepper into his burger everytime he goes to MacDonalds. I ate good food again, and went to a hot spring where I felt the ecstasy of hot water and then cold, over and over, next to the mountains. At another urban hot spring I met people from many different lands, and we spoke of those boundaries and then of the cracks that we felt comfortable enough to let slip through them. But then again I left and chose to be alone and turn right when it felt right, jump into life and run throughout the city, or go climbing, or try every different dessert in the convenience store.

Finally I went to another land, another edge of this universe, and stared the machine that burst through the city day after day in the eyes. I felt its metallic taste in my mouth and I mostly liked it. This time I chose to be with friends, of which many choose to live in the machine. But I mostly went around with those who I was there to work with, mostly just having the time to eke out a few spare sparks of metal from the rest (but in due time). So again I walked across the city on my worn feet, and we got to open a box full of more lives, but this time they went backwards rather than forward. They unraveled like thread under our hands as we went through them like TV episodes, replaying their trajectory and imagining what it would be like to fly the same course.

We learned a lot. We imagined ourselves in machines of all kinds and colors. But we also felt this nudging tingle that maybe the world could let us fly without metal, our bare skin slowly slipping against the shape of the world and holding on just because. We went up some trees, and looked down on this valley again. What a place. We chose to work till the lack of sleep made us stupid, and then we said that if we succeeded we would go up a mountain. We failed, but it was close. So it goes.

We felt the insane energy of a world writhing into neat shape, a 1000 doors suddenly opening and not enough time to look through all of them. The raw excitement at seeing that really you are the one driving. So what will you do? When the storm calms and suddenly the void is yours to cut through like a block of stone waiting to be made what will you slice? and then what will stare back at you when the dust settles down?

Being in control is a funny thing. There is a mountain to climb and a cliff to fall off of and at the end of the day you need to stick the landing. I think being in control is something I value a lot. I hold on to the wind like I can’t let go and hold and hold and push it left and right until it finally pushes me where I belong. Like a child holding on to his toys for too long. But even so I would not say I am a very controlled person. Sometimes I see a peak from afar and as I go up along the crests I choose to fall to the side through translucent glass which I go against and I break it with my hands and then I fall onto one leg awkwardly, trying to catch myself, and I think wow yeah I was in control and I knew what I was doing and now I can see the rainbow glowing through the mountain but my hands are bleeding.

Why try to take stock of the course you might take when you can simply sway back and let the world astonish you with its color? An old woman told me that sometimes you can hold onto an egg so hard your hands go white and it shell cracks all over your skin. But sometimes, when you finally let go and look down onto it, there is an eye staring back at you and you feel the miracle of the egg and the world it hides.

But most of the time you just lost it all because you couldn’t bring yourself to eat the egg in your hands while you could have. Because you couldn’t just close your eyes and open your mouth and let the warmth gladly flow through. It can be hard to know when to stop and sit on some rock of the mountain and pull out your sandwich and stare onto the green.

Maybe I want to hold on because I lack control where it matters. Have you ever heard the myth of Arjuna and the bird from the Mahabharata?  Maybe I would like that level of control:

Dronacharya gave a test to his students. He showed them the bird and said, what do you see? One by one they said the bird, the leaves, the trees, the people around, etc… And then he asked Arjuna: what do you see? And Arjuna looked onto the bird and the storm calmed and the leaf stopped its course and his breath shortened and for a moment he stood at the edge and the world shrunk until there was no longer such a thing as an edge and he saw what the bird was and he said: I see its eyes, only its eyes, like a vivid point calling out to me in a sea of nothing. And then his limbs moved of their own accord and he drew his arrow and shot it straight into its eyes.

For Arjuna the question of control and trajectory and choice and energy dissolve into the simple reality that there is just one world like a blue dot there in front of you and all your life wind has been pushing you straight forward and your legs are walking forwards and your eyes are staring down the path and all you see is the eyes of the bird waiting for you to look into them and there is no notion of control or you and your shape hitting against the world there is simply the motion of life slipping from one moment to the next in fundamentally the only way that could ever make sense.

Arjuna stands on the edge and knows he will not fall, because there is simply no world in which he ever could. He is here to stand there. This is what he is made for. He is here to breathe the mountain air and he is here to look down at the valley once again and see the bird waiting for him miles away, and then to reach for it. Maybe there is something here that is beyond control.

Maybe this is peace.",,0
Taking the L: Part ✌️,Kayode D. '27,7,2025-03-13T00:00:00-04:00,"[i think i need to drop another class]

Hey gang, it’s your favorite failure, back to fail a little bit more!

I think that the weather has a significant impact on my mood. This week has been abnormally warm, up in the fifties, and it’s the most positive and happy I’ve been in weeks. I thought that this was just some psychological thing that people talk about happening to OTHER people, but no, it truly got to me. Now I’m feeling good, and want to blog a bunch! Maybe I have a seasonal writer’s block…



This semester I’m taking four classes: 2.007, 2.086, 6.1010, and 21.01. 

2.007 – Design and Manufacturing I

If you’ve ever done First Lego League of First Robotics, then you’ve taken part in a piece of MIT history. First Robotics was started by Woody Flowers, who was the first instructor of 2.007. This class is like the origin of everything engineering that I did in middle school. I loved lego robotics, and my mom can testify that I would stay after school literally every single day to build and work on the robotics board. 

The theme for this year is “Wicked FBD: Applying Gravity”, and the board is Wicked themed. There’s a poppy field in munchkin land, a train that goes to Oz, and a giant Oz head in the middle of the board that can multiply your point totals. The biggest challenge, though, is to retrieve the broomstick from the highest point on the map. 

This class is known to be a massive time commitment. On top of building and testing and refining your robot, there are also three homework assignments a week to keep up with. I did not do a very good job of keeping up with them in the beginning, and I am paying for that now. 😬

A great blog from Petey that shows more footage of the class!

2.086 Numerical Computation for Mechanical Engineers

2.086 is a class that focuses on how to use Matlab. We work through different algorithms and processes and code up solutions to some intense problems. It’s honestly my least committed class, and so I do the poorest in it and enjoy it the least. The very first pset, I waited until 8pm the night before it was due, literally the night of the 
        SUPER BOWL
      
  . And I had never used Matlab before, but somehow I thought that my plot armor would help me power through it in one night with no help. I got 5% on that assignment.

They also have these interviews. You, the professor, and some other staff. One question, 5 minutes. The goal is to prove that you’ve been doing the homework and understand it. The question is specific enough that you’d only know the answer if you actually did all of the work, and there are unlimited retakes if you fail. But you HAVE to show up on time, or you forfeit the points. Guess what I did?

I set my interview for 10:45 AM on Tuesday, and I woke up at 10:45a AM on Tuesday. I woke up freaking out, I changed fast, woke up my roommate by accident, 
        borrowed his bike
      
 , and got to the office on the fourth floor of building 4 for the interview at 10:52. Seven minutes late. I was totally out of breath and asked if there was any way I could still be interviewed. They were strict, but fair, and did not allow me to take the interview, and I had to forfeit the points. I just sat outside the office completely defeated and lost. How could I have let this happen? Where had I gone wrong? This L was a punch to the gut.

6.1010 Fundamentals of Programming

6.1010 is known to be one the hardest coding classes among students. It’s a lot more intense and involved than 6.100L, and it builds in difficulty with each pset. So far, we’ve been modifying audio and image files with code, which created this masterpiece they showed in lab:

“You are my sunshineMy only sunshineYou make me happyWhen skies are gray”

I really enjoyed the first few assignments, but I did not give myself enough time to finish them. Every Thursday night I am up until 3 or 4 in the morning coding. I was debugging one section of code that kept returning errors, and the issue was a SINGLE PIXEL IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER. The fringest of fringe cases. Grrr.

…

I thought that all of this seemed like a good course load when I signed up for it. Apparently it was not. I have not turned in a single pset this entire semester that was both on time and completed. I’ve been averaging 70% on all of my assignments. And I know that I could do better. I’m really excited 
        about
      
 my classes, and I want to do well in them. 

I had a talk with my instructor in 2.007 recently that didn’t go the best. He told me that he knows I can do good work, he’s seen it. And he doesn’t need to know what’s going on in my life to be taking up my time, but if I want to be successful, I have to start committing more time to my work. Not cramming and powering through everything in one night, but intentionally working to get caught up and do well in the class.

…

I reached a point one night where I felt so defeated. I had so much work to do, so many Psets and readings and labs to do, and certainly not enough time to do them all. I could feel myself slipping away. In defeat, I looked at my phone and saw a message in a Cru group chat sharing that there would be a spontaneously planned prayer and worship in the 
        CFL
      
 that night at 8. It was 7:30. I had so much work to do. I had every reason and then some to say that I was too busy. But I knew that this was literally too much for me to take. I packed up and headed over. 

It was what I needed. I remember what got through me the most was the song “Make Room” by Community Music. The lyrics says “

Here is where I lay it down

Every burden, every crown

This is my surrender

…

And I will make room for You

To do whatever You want to

To do whatever You want to

… ”

 

I realized that I was holding on too tightly. I wasn’t making room for God. In my scheduling and in my day, I only ever prayed/read my bible in the morning or at night, when I was extremely tired. I wasn’t making time to rest or spend real time with God. And even more than that, I wasn’t making room for God to work spontaneously in my life. I was so pressed for time constantly, and I didn’t even have time to be with my friends or spend time with people. I felt like a zombie that wasn’t very good at being a zombie.

I needed to make a change. Something has to go. I decided to drop 6.101. At first, I didn’t want to drop anything. I’m only in four classes, which is for the most part the standard number to be taking in a semester. To drop to three would not set me behind for graduating, and I don’t even necessarily need 6.101 for course 2A6. I am just so in my own head that this is the way it has to be because this is the way that I’ve seen it done, and to quit or back out is to show weakness. 

…

The other day, a professor of mine mentioned that they read and enjoyed my first “Taking the L” blog, and so I went back and read it. Reading it, I realized that 1. It’s a fire blog and 2. I should take my own advice. Dropping a class or dropping to a lower level is not failure, and even if it is, that isn’t a bad thing. Failure is not the opposite of success, but a step towards it. You learn to appreciate the fruit of success from the lessons of failure. And you only really fail when you give up. I literally wrote that. 

And now I feel so much better, you have no idea. I can actually work on all of my homework, and I can focus my time to get stuff done before two in the morning. 

My point with this blog is this: You don’t have to do a morbillion things to be successful. You don’t have to do what everyone else is doing. You don’t have to get 100% on every single assignment you’ve ever done in your entire life. Life goes on.

And you need to rest. Even God, maker of Heaven and Earth, rested after making all of creation. But if he really is as powerful as he says, why does he need to rest? Because he was setting an example for us. So make room for rest.

…

I started writing this blog at around 
        5pm
      
. It is now 9pm before the 6.101 pset is due. I planned to still finish this pset in the event that I end up actually sticking with the class, since I have enjoy it and maybe there is a way. But looking at the work I have ahead and all the other work I have, I truly didn’t think it was possible. So I began to pray. I prayed “God, I want to take this class. But I don’t see any way to keep going. I have so much to do, and I don’t have anything else that I could give up and keep my sanity other than this class. I just need help. I don’t know what to do.” and literally AS I’M PRAYING THIS, I get an email. It’s from the 2.086 Professor. And he’s asking if I am free tomorrow afternoon to do the interview. 

The Lord is good. In our waiting He is working, whether we see it or not.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/God-Is-Good-Blog.jpg

meet the simmons elevators!,Ellie F. '28,11,2025-03-12T00:00:00-04:00,"Things always seem to come in threes. The Three Musketeers. The Holy Trinity. Rock, Paper, Scissors. The Plastics. And for Simmons Hall, our three elevators, Alevator, Belevator, and Celevator, each named for the tower it calls home. 

MIT Wifi doesn’t work in the elevators, so whenever I’m in one, I have no choice but to ponder the machine surrounding me. All three elevators have a board full of posters, and the floor selection buttons that don’t always light up, and they all make a confusing series of dings whenever they open, but, like the distinct colors of their ceiling lights, they have very different personalities. 

Alevator is sweet as can be, and as the farthest elevator from the entrance of Simmons, no one ever uses her. That means that whenever you call her, you can hear her whir to life and go straight to you like a personal chauffeur. I have never felt more important in my life. Alevator is a golden retriever in mechanical box form and if she was a real person I think our friendship would be a bit toxic and codependent <3 Needless to say, she’s my favorite.

Belevator is probably our most well-known elevator. Belevator lands right outside the dining hall, and generally serves the widest range of Simmons, so he’s constantly on the run. The first time I tried to take Belevator, it took over three minutes of creaking and groaning for him to arrive. He breaks down on a regular basis, much like MIT students during midterms season. In fact, he is so reliably unreliable that the Simmons Discord server has a channel dedicated to warning people when he’s out of service. We also have Belevator Down hoodies prominently displayed among campus fashion.

Celevator is my home elevator as a resident of C Tower. She’s the first elevator you see as you enter Simmons, and as such, is quite popular. Even though she’s pretty busy, she rarely breaks down. You always seem to be sharing the elevator with a stranger in awkward silence, and Celevator also has a strange habit of going all the way to the first floor, pausing, and then actually going to the floor you selected.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/belevator-0-800x1109.jpg

Eating Studio Ghibli Foods 🌾,Fiona L. '27,11,2025-03-11T00:00:00-04:00,"At the start of this month, I had the chance to eat at a Studio Ghibli themed pop-up restaurant, organized by 
         MIT MINCE 
      
. As a big Studio Ghibli fan with an ever-growing collection of Totoro themed objects, I was extremely excited when I heard about the upcoming pop-up from Gilford T ’26, one of the club’s new members. I’d only been to one MINCE pop-up before (Lunar New Year themed, in the McCormick Green Room!), but I felt like this opportunity couldn’t be passed up.



studio ghibli pop-up announcement!





my email invitation to the pop-up



the setup + my plushies

(On a side note, it’s always nice to discover new “hidden spaces” around campus. I feel like no matter how many years one spends at MIT, there are always new rooms, new lounges, and new hidden crannies waiting to be discovered.)

I took the opportunity to bring every single Totoro-themed item I had: a Totoro tote bag, a Totoro cardigan, a Totoro hairclip, and two Totoro plushies. (There were even more items that I unfortunately had to leave at home.)

There was an option to enter the lottery as one or two people, although I didn’t have the time to ask somebody else to come with me, since I filled out the form last minute (😭). However, whether you come with a friend or not, you’ll still get the opportunity to meet new people at the pop-up—seating arrangements are randomly decided. At this particular pop-up, I got the opportunity to get to know Vivian H ’25, Jessica X ’24 MEng ’25, and Abrianna Z ’28. We were all different class years, but throughout the dinner, we bonded over enjoying the food and sharing our love for Ghibli films!

Now, onto the part that you’ve probably been waiting for: the food! Members of MINCE came from downstairs to bring each dish, so it really felt like we were at a restaurant. The food was as pretty as it was tasty. I used up a lot of self restraint taking pictures of each dish before digging in. 
 After each dish had been served, the people who had created each recipe talked about their ideas for the dish, and the process of creating it.

the menu for the pop-up

Drink: Ponyo’s Sea

Blue Curaçao, coconut extract, lemon-lime soda.

My Rating: 7.5/10

i slurped the ocean 😋

The drink was delicious! Fizzy, a little sweet, and really, really pretty. If you search up “anime water,” you’ll see exactly what this drink reminded me of. I wish water in real life could look like this ;-;

I finished the drink very quickly, as I usually do, and found that there was one, long cylinder of ice left behind. I battled with that piece of ice as I tried to retrieve the leftover pieces of blue jelly from the bottom of the tall glass.

Bread: Kiki’s Flight


Kavring cat rolls, herring biscuits, and baguettes with a butter flight: ube, black garlic, and tomato chili.


My Rating: 9/10

a ‘flight’ of bread & butter

The most challenging parts of eating this, for me, was finding a way to 
        split each bread
      
 and trying not to double-dip in the butter. Each of the dips was so good, carefully balancing between “too much” and “not enough” flavor. I also liked how different and high-quality each type of bread was, especially given that they were all homemade.

I had eaten so much bread that I felt like I wouldn’t have any room for the rest of the menu, but I would soon find myself surprised by my own abilities.

Appetizer: Totoro Trio

Salmon & black sesame onigiri, butterfly pea & sweet potato onigiri, and coconut mango onigiri, served with broccolini purée.

My Rating: 5/10

totoro rice balls :)

Mixed feelings on the Totoro rice balls: I absolutely LOVED seeing them. I felt that creating 30*3 different Totoros would’ve taken so much time and effort, plus they turned out so adorable. I loved the reference to my favorite Ghibli movie of all time, which I’ve indoctrinated my entire family and my friends from home into watching.

I asked the others at my table what order I should eat the Totoros in: big to small, or small to big? They suggested I eat them from from 
        big to small
      
, and I took a big bite into a Totoro filled with salmon. Although I usually really hate salmon, this salmon was okay! My favorite was medium Totoro, which was filled with sweet potato.

Main Course: Calcifer’s Feast

Shakshuka-baked egg, fondant potatoes, and cripsy pork belly served with a black garlic-romesco sauce.


My Rating: 9/10

our main course! the sauce on the plate made me feel like i was at a super fancy restaurant ^^

The main course was delicious! Both sauces were also similarly delicious, and I found that the fancy way of spreading them over the plate made them easier to dip into. I had no idea how they managed to “bake” the egg, but I thought it was delicious! I’d never eaten an egg like that in my life. The pork belly was also a great mix of soft fat and crispy skin.

Palette Cleanser: Castle Crystal

Yuzu tofu pudding, lavender raindrop cake, crowned with blue caramel shards.


My Rating: 8/10

Out of every dish, this was definitely the one where I spent the most time taking pictures. There was hardened caramel on top of each cake with a delicate, ornate design. I had no idea how it was made, but I really want to find out.

I didn’t know what a “palette cleanser” was before this, but I’d figure it would be like what this dish was for me—a small dish with a neutral taste, eaten before dessert.

Dessert: Soot Surprise

Black cocoa cream puff with black sesame cream and red bean mochi, served with raspberry purée.

My Rating: 7/10

The dessert was so cute! Almost too cute to eat. Almost. And fortunately, not too sweet either. The texture of the cream puff was nice, and the soot sprites came with multi-colored meringue stars that were very fun to eat.

Overall, I had an amazing time! The venue was set up beautifully, and all the food was really good. As a bonus, I got to discover a new part of a building that I rarely have the chance to go into. As somebody who loves meeting new people randomly and eating good food, I’ll hopefully find my way into more MINCE pop-ups soon :^)

A final note: if you’ve never seen screenshots of Ghibli food before, then you’re missing out!!! All the food in their movies looks so life-like and delicious, and I’m glad that this pop-up lived up to that aspect of its Ghibli inspirations.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-6.19.42-PM-1400x685.png

"What is engineering, anyways?",Emiko P. '25,4,2025-03-10T00:00:00-04:00,"1. Why I didn’t think I would be a good fit for engineering.

I came to MIT certain of one thing: I would never be an engineer. 

In eighth grade, everyone in my grade took a mandatory woodworking class. Even though the class was three months long, the only thing I can remember was the frustration of attempting engineering drawings. We would draw boxes and parts from three different angles – and I would always turn in my paper covered in layers of faded pencil marks as I erased and redrew, erased and redrew, over and over again. I remember taking a ruler to add measurements to my drawings, squinting and counting the lines on the ruler, messing up, then starting all over again. I was frustrated by the meticulous precision – I wanted to shred all those stupid engineering drawings and go outside and start cutting wood. 

While I did enjoy analytical things, activities involving precision didn’t come naturally to me. The cookies I baked never seem to come out tasting right and my chemistry experiments in high school would incur wild errors – and I would never know what I was doing wrong. I would try so hard to focus and pay attention and make things exact, but it just never seemed to work out. 

By the time I had to choose a major at MIT my freshman year, I had come to believe that precision and meticulousness were the defining traits of a good engineer – qualities I most certainly didn’t see in myself. I knew I didn’t fit the mold, and, to be honest, I wasn’t even interested. You can therefore understand why majoring in mechanical engineering never crossed my mind.

Until it did. 

At the end of my freshman year at MIT, I declared brain and cognitive sciences as my major for one simple reason: because it was cool, and studying something cool would make me happy. I spent that next summer in Madrid, Spain in a computational neuroscience lab. And while I had chosen that lab because it was cool – studying emotions and Alzheimer’s – I found myself feeling deeply bored and unsatisfied.

I found my mind wandering to new things – I wanted to do something that mattered, and for me, a lab project that I would only see the results of in 10 years didn’t fit the bill.

With my newly declared major suddenly scrapped, I embarked on some soul-searching and deep digging of MIT’s Course Catalog. I emerged from my search with a surprising decision, choosing to change my major to something I had ruled out since the very beginning: mechanical engineering.

2. A shift in perspective.

In my desperation to find my path forward after brain and cognitive sciences abruptly lost its magic, every option was back on the table. This time, I guided my decision-making process by asking myself what my core values are. I decided that these were creativity, collaboration, and impact. With those three things, I knew I would be happy, and I kept them in mind as I went back to the drawing board for a new major.

I had always been interested in physics, mostly because of cool space applications. The idea of black holes and dark energy and time travel all seemed so cool, and physics seemed like the lens through which I could study such fascinating topics. And I would be happy! But my time in my lab in Madrid bothered me because of impact. I wanted to do something, and the result of physics felt a little too close to brain and cognitive sciences: studying something because it was cool, not because I would be able to do anything tangible with it. And before anyone says anything, of course physics is amazing, and many people can do great things with it that will change our world forever. Perhaps understanding the physics of the world and of our brains is the most important thing we can do as humans. But I… didn’t want to do that. I needed something else.

So, what else fit the bill? Well, I turned to the idea of creativity: What about science journalism or policy? I was definitely drawn to these. Their magnetic pull was steering my hand to my computer mouse, filling out the change of major form, and guiding my imagination through a life where I was pursuing these things. And I would be happy.

But something stopped me. 

For goodness sakes, something stopped me, because that wasn’t a good enough reason anymore. Happy wasn’t good enough anymore. If I took classes because they made me happy, then I wouldn’t take anything hard. And if I didn’t take anything hard, then how the heck was I going to learn anything at all? And that scared the crap out of me – the idea of coming to MIT and not learning anything? The idea of being surrounded by brilliant minds and taking the easy road just so I could stay happy? That didn’t sound like happiness at all. In fact, the idea made me distinctly unhappy.

So, I took a look at it again: the one major I never let myself think about, because it made me unhappy – or maybe I should say uncomfortable. Mechanical engineering was uncomfortable. Deeply so, because I didn’t truly know anything about it besides that it involved precision and some sort of deep-rooted love for Legos that I wasn’t born with.

I could hear my eighth-grade self screaming, watching in horror as I started tromping down the path towards engineering drawings and precision and everything I had assumed I hated. But I had a sneaking suspicion telling me that engineering had more in store for me than that.

Because as I continued thinking about creativity, collaboration, and impact… it dawned on me that mechanical engineering had all three. Everywhere I looked within the field, engineers were working together in teams to solve novel problems and change the world. Maybe everything I was looking for was waiting for me in the mechanical engineering department. 

The idea began to grow on me. I began to imagine a world in which I graduated from MIT as a mechanical engineer. I began to imagine a world in which I chose classes and my major not because they would make me “happy” but because they would challenge me and force me to truly, deeply learn.

Before I knew it, I was talking with the academic advisor of the department, explaining my pros and cons list for why I should switch my major to mechanical engineering. I explained to her my fears – I had been certain I’d never be an engineer.

The first thing she said was: “Well, a pros and cons list is a very engineering thing to do.”

I filled out the change of major form the very next day.

3. Why it actually ended up being a good fit.

As you may have guessed, the decision to major in mechanical engineering ended up being a great one for me. Over the course of my three years as a mechanical engineering student, I have realized that the qualities of a good engineer are not only precision, math equation wizardry, and the love of things like Legos and Ikea, but other things as well. Other things that I discovered I remarkably have, such as my core values of creativity, collaboration, and impact.

Let’s start with creativity. Because my concentration within mechanical engineering is product development, I’ve gotten to create a lot of things. In most of my product development classes, you are presented with an amorphous problem that you are tasked with solving. It’s up to you what direction you want to take to solve it, and that’s something that really surprised me and began to unravel my initial impressions of engineering. Contrary to my initial impression that engineering must always be precise, I’ve encountered so much freedom in engineering. There are a million ways to solve the same problem, and your imagination and creativity is more of a superpower than your ability to measure things with a ruler.

For example, one of my first design classes required that we bring 15-foot-tall balloons to the ground. There are dozens of ways you can accomplish this task: you can pop the balloons, catch them in a net, knock them down with a tower, lasso them like Indiana Jones, or even suck all the air out of the room to create a vacuum (this idea was not approved). 

This creativity can be expressed in any project: I’ve built my own robot that had functional detachable arms, I’ve designed waterproof casings for an asthma diagnosis device, I’ve coded line-following robots, I’ve designed litter picker-uppers, I’ve gone through the product design process of building a powered mask for wildland firefighters, and the list goes on. 

And what’s even more special is that I didn’t have to do any of these projects alone. You are not expected to know how to build robots from scratch or how to code – but you are expected to collaborate and ask questions. Engineering is unique because working in teams is the norm, which makes it a very friendly and collaborative environment. Some of my favorite moments at MIT have been working with a team on a class project, brilliance sparking between us, and our idea snowballing as it becomes better and better.

Best of all, engineering allows you to solve real problems. The product we built in 2.009 is a powered respiratory system that could literally save firefighters’ lives. The product we built in D-Lab is an asthma diagnosis device that could be carried around in a backpack to rural parts of India that would otherwise not have access to respiratory tests. My summer internship two years ago was part of the race to build the world’s first commercial lunar lander. These things are real and they are epic and this is what engineering is.

4. Defining engineering.

As you can see, engineering isn’t only about building mechanical parts – it’s about artful problem-solving and working with others. It goes beyond making individual pieces, but to building systems where parts and processes work together seamlessly. It’s about building things for people that are needed and wanted. That’s the thing about mechanical engineering: it’s an organic, human-centric process.

And I’ve been talking a lot about mechanical engineering here, but these ideas apply to other disciplines of engineering like civil, biological, chemical, electrical, software, aerospace, environmental, industrial, materials, nuclear, and so on.

There are many ways you can be an engineer, and that’s why my favorite definition of engineering is: “the action of working artfully to bring something about.”

5. What this means for you.

People choose the same path for a variety of reasons. Just because you and someone else are in the same major, but have wildly different reasons for being there, doesn’t mean that you don’t belong. Engineering can be a space for you, no matter what brings you there – whether it’s a love of math and precision, imagination and design, or something beyond.

So, if you’ve decided quickly and early that you are not something or will never consider something… maybe reevaluate. Maybe see if that quick rejection is hiding something deeper – maybe you’re like me, and your hate for eighth grade woodworking and failure at baking cookies doesn’t actually mean you wouldn’t like mechanical engineering. Because maybe you don’t even know what mechanical engineering really is, and you may be missing out on the adventure of a lifetime.

A few days ago, I got some really great news. I was interviewed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers last December, and this month they featured me in an article in their monthly Mechanical Engineering Magazine about collegiate athletes studying engineering. After all the hard work and self-discovery that occurred as I pursued this major, it was honestly so exciting to share my adventure in one of the most influential mechanical engineering magazines in the world. 

And to think, I came to MIT vowing never to be an engineer. And to think, when I changed my major, I had thought with awe about the fact that in three years’ time, maybe I could become an engineer. Even though it would be hard, maybe I could do it. 

And I did it!

But more importantly, you can, too! I’m telling you this story to show you two things: 1) engineering encompasses so much more than you may think, 2) the world is your oyster, and you can do this! 

Do the hard thing, conquer the hard thing, and become an even better version of yourself in the process. And for those of you who don’t see your interests aligning with engineering at first, maybe take a second look :)",,0
"moving on, as shown through free t-shirts",Aiden H. '28,6,2025-03-10T00:00:00-04:00,"I have never read any of Marie Kondo’s books, nor have I claimed to, but I feel like we’re connected on at least some minor spiritual level. Although it’s definitely some form of undiagnosed anxiety or minor mental health disorder I’ve always hated physical stuff. Even when I was a kid, I wanted my room to be as clean as possible, with everything straightened and as little stuff to trip over as possible. When we moved apartments freshman year of high school, I didn’t put up any decorations on my walls because I didn’t want to spend the money or feel cluttered/off-balance. The only things in my room were a bed, bookshelf, and keyboard. I kept it that way for four years.

This led to a bad habit of me pushing all the little things I actually had to keep but never wanted to look at (sentimental knick knacks, random notebooks and folders, maybe even my social security card) into my closet, which stayed in a state of constant chaos. Every 
        opening
      
 of the closet door instantly spiked my blood pressure levels. So in an effort of personal development, noticing how my college closet has been led to the same fate, I have decided on minor downsizing.

The issue is I don’t actually have that many clothes. I have maybe 4 pairs of pants and 6 shirts I can rotate for a max of like 8 outfits in any season. However, what I lack in day-clothes-I-would-actually-wear-outside I make up for with really-ugly-free-t-shirts-that-I-only-wear-to-bed-and-embarrassingly-to-the-bathroom-at-like-2-AM. In my most recent inventory, I have over 40 of these oddities, and they sit in a large, unkempt stack at the bottom of my closet that prevents me from putting anything else there.

Even though I cycle through these pretty regularly, when deciding what to keep and give away, I started thinking about the random scenarios I actually got these t-shirts. I decided to share some (but definitely not all) of the highlights, explain how I got them, and why/why not I’m keeping them.

 

Tie-Dye Regrets

#1: At some point during deep COVID lockdown times, my friend and I rode our bikes to the closest Walmart and tie-dyed the largest shirts we could find. Although the result is minorly atrocious, it acts almost like a mumu and is objectively the best sleepwear.

Fun Fact: This shirt is so large that even a .5x wasn’t zoomed out enough for me to get it all on my camera. 

#2/3: These are two years of shirts from the same club: Sources of Strength. It was branded as the school’s mental health awareness club, but since Gen-Z mental health is an issue that no amount of an unfunded high school club can fix, we didn’t do a lot other than sit around and talk about our feelings at lunch. Once a year, though, we designed our t-shirt. Junior year, this was us all deciding on a mountain range (because Colorado? I guess?). Senior year, that had us each draw a little thing that made us happy in a circle and then scanned it onto a t-shirt (I think I drew a piece of cake). Then, we were supposed to come in on a Saturday to tie-dye it as a group. I see many problems with this:

- Saturday tie-dye session? It was always at like 9:30 A:M, and one year I had to work and couldn’t make it anyway (hence the plain white one).

- Tie-dye ruins the point of having a design on the shirt. I can’t read anything on the shirts through the neon colors that make me think of the Trolls movie.

- Tie-dye makes shirts kinda scratchy, especially when they’re already low quality (which makes sense considering public high school budgeting).

Verdicts: Keep 1, get rid of 2 and 3.

National Honor Society



This was the shirt for my junior year of NHS. It was the first year I was on the board, so I was mandated to wear this shirt twice a month in front of a group of dead-in-the-eyes peers in the gym at lunches. And honestly? Don’t hate it. We were going for a retro wave-ish vibe for no reason other than we decided on it, and it turned out as one of the most okay-ish looking free t-shirts I’ve ever got. Still not wearing it confidently when I want a good outfit, but not actively ugly.

I also wore this shirt once where I ran a community service event for the club where we partnered with the local Parks Department to plant trees for Arbor Day. I shall keep this shirt in honor of Albert (the tree).

Verdict: Keep 🌲

Speech and Debate

This is the 
        three-year progression
      
 of t-shirts I got at the national speech and debate tournament.

#1: This was the summer after freshman year, aka deep COVID. Because of this, instead of traveling to a location, my team went into my coach’s parent’s basement that we took over for a week with dozens of muffins and floor naps and hours of pinball on their pinball machine. I didn’t do great though and the shirt is the oldest and frumpiest.

#2: This was the first in-person year in Louisville, KY. We stayed in a Victorian-mansion-turned-Airbnb and got an arguably cuter color for the t-shirt. Over the course of the week, all I remember about competition is early-morning humidity and one guy telling me “not to hold my breath until my argument came true”, but KY itself was nice. We got yelled at for trying to go on the roof of the mansion and later went on an (awful, hot, long, but camp) ghost tour of Louisville houses. When I got this shirt I really liked it, but after years of wearing it, by lethally acidic face wash has bleached parts of it, and repeated washes have made the shirt very dry and scratchy.

#3: Similar to KY, Phoenix is nothing more memorable than “hot”. This was the year I did best, and we did have a pool at the VRBO we stayed in, so most of my memories are us destroying ping-pong and the pool. It was also the year that the Nuggets won the NBA finals, so we watched the final game and screamed. This shirt is also a little dry and over-worn (seems like the NSDA needs a higher shirt budget), but it has the cutest logo because it was the first year they decided on a mascot for the tournament (Prickles, cause Arizona yk). It also has the most recent memories attached to it.

Verdict: Keep 3, get rid of 1 and 2. It feels weird to get older and older and keep all of them. I don’t want to be like 25 with 3 of basically the same shirt from a high school extracurricular.

Music?

#1: I dislike Guns N Roses to a fairly extreme extent. I don’t like dad rock, don’t think Axl Rose can still sing, and they don’t really have that many generationally-spanning hits that could put them in the same echelon of importance as other old bands like The Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc. etc. All this being said, my friend’s parents last year were going to their reunion tour in Denver and asked (begged?) if I would go with him so he didn’t have to sit alone at Guns N Roses. Turns out that this was the longest concert ever known, and I sat through the Eras Tour and its movie. After an hour-long opener, Guns N Roses came out while graphics of what I think were fetuses or some sort of deranged anthropomorphic minions crawled frantically in a mass on screens around the stadium. Guns N Roses then proceeded to play what I could only imagine is their entire discography for a nearly 4 hour set. After nearly 5 hours in Ball Arena, we agreed to not go to a Guns N Roses concert ever again. For Christmas he got me this Guns N Roses shirt. I retaliated with off-brand 
        Pit Vipers
      
. Because it’s an actual tour shirt, though, it’s shockingly high quality.

#2: As the only Britney Spears in my household (unfortunately), my mom jokingly got this shirt when she saw it at a Target. It is a large and I’m not that self-evolved, so I have never worn this except as pajamas. Regardless, it’s Britney Spears and I do wear the shirt.

Verdict: Keep both for the joke and the comfort.

Oversized Grandpa Shirts

I own 3-4 of these shirts that are hand-me-downs from my girlfriend’s grandpa. I dug through a hamper of like 30 and picked out the funniest three or four. I need these to be physically documented and yes I wear these XXXLs around Maseeh obsessively. Sorry? Sorry? What do you mean I don’t look good in this Margaritaville shirt that goes down to my knees that I got from a 70 year old I met once?

Verdict: Keep both, duh

The Greatest T-Shirts of All Time

#1: I don’t even think I watched Sesame Street as a kid but the first time I saw this shirt I bursted out laughing harder than I ever have. I’m 99% sure it is available at most Walmarts, but the idea of me as the scrawniest nerd acting like a pimp because I watched PBS is hilarious, and the dad joke on the shirt will never get old.

Fun Fact: I have actually been gifted this shirt twice by two different people years apart. People just know me that well I guess.

#2: My libertarian (?) cousin passive aggressively/jokingly gave me this at my high school graduation, and despite how I kinda 
        detest political paraphernalia
      
, I find the shirt just ironic enough that it’s kinda funny. I wear this shirt a lot in the summer because it’s the perfect amount of flowy without being baggy. I did get some stares from the geriatrics when I would go play pickleball though.

Verdict: Keep both.

That’s all. It doesn’t look like I gave up that many shirts, but I promise I am. It turns out that most shirts I’m willing to give away are just solid-toned t-shirts from 
        Old Navy
      
 I don’t remember ever buying. Let’s hope daylight savings today encourages even more spring cleaning (and fixes everything else that stems from the plague that is known as winter).

Bad Ideas events I went to (another late IAP post),Anika H. '26,2,2025-03-08T00:00:00-05:00,"IAP is one of my favorite times of the year, because it’s the best time to do stupid things at the canonical school of smart people with minimal consequences. And every year, we celebrate this fact with a whole weekend of absolute tomfoolery. With that said, I proudly present to you some of the dumb shit I participated in.

hot ones MIT edition – Bonfire, Random Hall

This was probably the one event I was most excited to go to. There were a lot of chicken, and also pages filled with integrals, in case you preferred mental pain instead of physical pain. It was free food, so I made my way up some floors to Bonfire to see, unsurprisingly, people eating chicken, chugging milk, and dying of heat in the middle of winter. I started on the medium spice, and it was pretty good. I ate one because I was hungry and felt like doing some integrals. And then I got bored, so I asked people what the worst one was, and they said it was a sauce called “Da Bomb”.

It can’t be that bad right? WRONG. My pride as an Asian with spice tolerance was shattered. I was fine for the first 3 seconds, so I took a few bites, though the sauce tasted weirdly bitter. And then it hit. It felt like I ate a mouthful of hot coals straight from the forge of Hephaestus himself. From then on, the spice got logarithmically worse, and I was fighting for my life in between gulps of milk. I gave up on finding cups and was chugging it straight from a bowl. That way, when I was not actively drinking, I could soak the lower half of my face in milk to feel less of the pain. I’m extremely glad that I’m not lactose intolerant, because if I was, the amount of milk I drank would have been a way bigger problem than the spicy chicken. By the end of the event, I was quite full— of mostly milk.

i eat hot chicken and regret my life decisions

If you ever decide to try something like this, I would highly recommend drinking as much milk as you possibly can. Casein (a protein found in milk) binds to capsaicin (the spicy chemical), making it much more effective than water to wash out the spiciness. Remember, what goes in one end must come out the other. Unfortunately for us, our bodies don’t completely digest all the capsaicin we ingest. So if you somehow managed to tough out eating it without neutralizing any of the spice, you’re gonna have a hell of a time on the toilet in a few hours. (I didn’t, the milk works)

pronoun fight – AIW, Random Hall

In this fight, you are to bet your pronouns, or the letters of your name, or both. I wanted to bet my name so that I could go from being called Anika to being called Aia (aiya). I tried to lose letters, got too into it, and ended up with extra. The “fights” can be anything the two parties agree too, and can be anything from staring contests, to Super Smash Bros, to boxing. Basically, anything within reason.

The default fight is a wrestling match, and I was relatively decent at those, given that my opponent wasn’t too many weight classes above me. I wrestled some number of times, including one where I went with an arm behind my back because I was fighting a frosh who had no prior experience. Unfortunately for him, I ended that one pretty quick. I lost waterbottle flipping against Pablo and a round where I tried to kick a small target on someone who’s running away from me. By the end of the event, after watching many spectacular matches and dabbling in a few myself, I went from being Anika she/her/hers, to Aniaih she/her/hers/he. It wasn’t quite the result I hoped for, but it was really fun.

2^n dumplings – Next House Country Kitchen

While I was here for two hours, I didn’t actually end up eating all that many dumplings, because most of my time was spent hard carrying the wrapping station. I learned how to wrap them properly from my family (shoutout mom and grandma!), and have gone to this event every year since freshman year. We went through several packs of premade dumpling skins, and I showed new people how to make them as they came in. I don’t how much we ended up with, but I think it could have been anywhere from 2^7 to 2^9 dumplings.



cursed tiramisu – Burton Connor TV Lounge

More free food! Visitors were encouraged to take a lady finger (a type of biscuit), dip it in a mystery flavor, and then coat it in custard and cocoa powder. The flavor of tiramisu you got was chosen by the wheel of doom. There were some good options on it, like caffeinated chocolate, and some terrible ones like Spagetti-os and soy sauce. I was quite lucky for the most part given how many I ate, but got Spagetti-o’s once and decided to call it a day there because of how bad it was. I’m very very happy I didn’t get soy sauce. The few poor souls who got them looked like their taste buds were begging for mercy.

When I decided to take a break from tiramisu, I was in the corner learning how to play pool, which I soon learned that I absolutely suck at. I would often miss the ball right in front of me, but by some miracle, I managed to sink two balls in the holes in the span of an hour. Ryan also taught some of us how to play Gatas, where you would run around the table flinging the white cue ball at the 8-ball. I found this a lot more fun and a lot less challenging.

 

Some events that I briefly stopped by:

Dig Yer Own Grave

We weren’t allowed to dig the traditional 6 feet, but EHS did let us dig a 4 foot hole next to building 5, which I think is a pretty good compromise. I stopped by for a few minutes to help shovel rocks out the hole, but went back in because it was freezing and I left my jacket in a makerspace three buildings away.

Outdoor forge

I like bending hot glowy metal into funny shapes.

HOT COALS IN YOUR AREA!!!!!

Rat Cake Competition

Lots of rat shaped cakes. Lots of good cake rats, but only one was crowned the king of rats.

I asked people at MIT what they were doing for Pi Day 2025,Jebby B. '25,20,2025-03-07T00:00:00-05:00,"Pi Day is a big deal at MIT. Not only does it go hand-in-hand with the “nerd culture” that MIT is known for, but it’s also tradition to announce Regular Action decisions on Pi Day every year.

But, what exactly does Pi Day look like at MIT? Do students eat pie? Do people recite the digits of pi? Or maybe there’s a mysterious tradition that even I don’t know about.

So, I went around campus to get the scoop on how students and staff will be observing Pi Day 2025 — which, NASA tells me, is also a “blood moon” total lunar eclipse.





We chatted a little more about student life before they left for the Fest. As I walked down the Infinite Corridor, the 251-meter hallway that passes through the main campus, I noticed a prominent trail of BLOOD MOON FEST flyers lining the wall. There was so much enthusiasm radiating from the walls that I couldn’t help but follow the trail myself.

Even then, I underestimated how excited students were about this “Blood Moon Fest,” until I ran into three more students who were eagerly reading the signs outside.



GUSTAV: I’ve been busy figuring out my joint physics-philosophy degree. Allow me to demonstrate with this participatory thought experiment:

Brain Twister #43 (a)  Please indicate which of the nine celestial bodies you would run over with a fusion-powered trolley to minimize harm to the rest of the Solar System. The trolley is traveling at 1% of the speed of light and can be approximated as a sphere of radius 1 meter.





The three students seemed to have completely forgotten I was there. Nellie and Beatrice wildly gesticulated at their notebooks while Gustav sent pleading eyes toward the heavens, as if hoping the Blood Moon would suddenly emerge to save him from the onslaught of mathematics of objects that were not, in fact, approximate as spheres.

I didn’t want to be late to the Blood Moon Fest, so I left these students to their debate and continued following the flyers.

I walked by labs filled with mysterious and important-looking equipment, and nearly got hit by a door as a professor exited her office. She was very kind, though. Turns out that we were both headed to Blood Moon Fest, so I was able to ask her a couple questions along the way.





Moonstones? Like the gemstone? PROFESSOR: No no, those are moonstones. I’m talking about MOONstones!

Typically, I only share this little secret with my UROPs, my archnemeses, and strangers in the Kavli Institute lounges… but you look trustworthy.

In layman’s terms, MOONstones are like lucky charms mixed with kyber crystals, mixed with plutonium, mixed with Vicks Vaporub.

By optimizing the hyperintegrated parameterized eigen-matter of the BLOOD MOON’s gravitational flux, one can acquire LIMITLESS PSYCHIC POWER.

POWER ENOUGH TO LEAP ACROSS THE CHARLES RIVER.

POWER ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE STATA CENTER BACK INTO A NORMAL SHAPE.

POWER ENOUGH TO COMMAND A HORDE OF BEAVERS WITH TELEPATHY!

Our conversation delved deeper into the crystal structure of “MOONstones” before we got sidetracked discussing the latest Severance episode.

Soon, we arrived at the Blood Moon Fest that I’d been hearing about all day! It was a modest, but endearing sight. Students came in all kinds of costumes, mingling and chatting. Someone’s Bluetooth speaker was blasting a WMBR-hosted cover of “Red Moon Supernova” (a spin on the Chappell Roan song). I was roped into a spontaneous conga line that was started by the Moon Institute of Technology Club, a small group of students who are passionate about establishing a sister campus for MIT on the moon.

Even though the “festival” resembled an elementary school fundraiser, the air buzzed with an energy that rivaled Coachella.

Suddenly, a student rushed towards the venue yelling, “Hear ye, hear ye! The Man in the Moon is here!” Behind them, no one other than Stu Schmill walked forward as the student presented him with a handmade Blood Moon costume.

As he stepped up on a platform, a hush fell over the small crowd.



Students were cheering and screaming. Frank and John got so excited that they started punching the ground.

To be completely honest, there was a part of me that expected Blood Moon Fest to be something arcane and mystical. But in the end, it was just normal people coming together to celebrate the little joys and nerdy coincidences in this corner of the universe.

I guess the real magic was the friends we made along the way.

"Birds Are Real, and So Is Quantum Physics",Andi Q. '25,5,2025-03-06T00:00:00-05:00,"I believe in quantum physics now.

The past few weeks have changed the way I look at the world. Experiment after experiment has confirmed that quantum phenomena, as absurd as they seem, are real. And for once, I was able to see these phenomena with my own two eyes, in the flesh, because I was the one to perform the experiments!

I performed all these experiments in 6.2410 (Quantum Systems Engineering Lab) – a class I’m taking this semester to convince myself that quantum physics is real. 6.2410 is all about two things: demonstrating the fundamental properties of quantum particles and using those properties to engineer sensors that exceed “classical” (non-quantum) limits.

Most of the experiments in 6.2410 use quantum optics – think lasers, mirrors, and whatnot. Except instead of the $5 lasers and mirrors you can find on Amazon, we use the “Quantenkoffer” – a $500k quantum optics toolkit from Germany with nanometer-scale control over laser/mirror alignment.

This thing costs as much as many of the tools in MIT.nano, and they let me (a clueless undergrad) use it!

It might sound like overkill, but it’s not. One of the most annoying things about working with quantum optics is that experiments are unbelievably sensitive to alignment, so even a tiny misalignment (e.g., from breathing too hard on your equipment) can throw off the entire system. (Ironically, this sensitivity is what makes quantum-enhanced sensing so useful in the first place.)

The Quantenkoffer handles most of this tricky alignment process for us and dramatically speeds up experiments. Instead of placing the optical components in “free space” (as in a traditional optics setup), 
        there are fixed slots where the components snap into place like LEGO bricks
      
. It’s not perfect and we still spend an hour each lab session aligning everything, but the instructors told me each experiment we do in 6.2410 (around two hours each) can easily span an entire semester at other universities without the Quantenkoffer.

We’ve worked with four different quantum effects so far:

- Entanglement.

- Single-photon interference.

- Two-photon interference (the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect).

- Photon antibunching (the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss effect).

The fact that these effects are real at all was mindblowing. (If you’ve ever seen a video of a monkey reacting to a magic trick, that’s exactly how I felt during the experiments.) But even more mindblowing was that people have found ways to apply these effects to solve real-world engineering problems!



So bear with me as I attempt to tell you about these effects and what makes them so weird.

Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is when two particles are correlated in a way that measuring one immediately gives you information about the other, no matter where it is.

In 6.2410, entanglement primarily appears as polarization entanglement. Polarization is a property of light that, for simplicity, we can measure as an angle between 0° and 90°. The Quantenkoffer has a laser that generates two photons at a time that are polarization entangled, meaning they are always both 0° (horizontally) polarized or 90° (vertically) polarized. This sounds impossible – how can we control individual photons with such precision? – but we verified with cold, hard measurements that this was indeed the case.

I honestly still don’t know how entanglement works. It feels like it just… happens sometimes. But I think most people don’t understand how it works. Even Einstein didn’t believe in entanglement in his day, and the (recent) 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded “for experiments with entangled photons”.

Entangled particles are the basis of many quantum technologies today, such as:

- Sensing: The classical sensing limits I mentioned above are usually due to unavoidable environmental noise. However, we can exploit the correlations between entangled particles to overcome these limits, because statistical correlations allow us to compensate for uncertainties in our measurements.

- Computing: After entangling several “qubits” (circuits that store quantum information), operations on one qubit affect all the others, which could significantly decrease the amount of work we need to do per computation.

Single-Photon Interference

This effect is a bit easier to explain than entanglement, but it is just as weird.

You may have heard that photons act as both particles and waves. Wave-particle duality doesn’t matter much for the amounts of light that humans typically interact with, but it has some bizarre implications when we go down to single photons.

Consider the following optical setup:

Photons enter the system at (a), go through a 50/50 beamsplitter, bounce off a mirror, go through another 50/50 beamsplitter, and exit at (d) or (e) into detectors.

You can think of 50/50 beamsplitters assigning incident photons randomly to one of two outputs. So if we treat the single photon as a particle, we’d expect the photon to exit at (d) or (e) equally as often.

But if we treat the single photon as a wave instead (and assume that the two possible paths through the system are equally long), the photon will always exit at (d). The wave interferes with itself at (e) and cancels itself out.

It turns out that the wave-like behavior is what happens in real life! If we send a stream of single photons through this system, then every single one will exit at (d), which we can measure.

This result was hard for me to accept because it just… doesn’t happen at macroscopic scales. Imagine if a restaurant has two main-course options (beef or chicken) and two dessert options (cake or pie), and every single person somehow chooses either {beef and cake} or {chicken and pie} and no other combination. It would be completely improbable, yet this is exactly what happens on the quantum scale.

Single-photon interference isn’t just a fun little quirk of physics; it also has many real-world applications that we constructed in the lab:

- Interaction-free measurement: Suppose we have some object in the way at (b), which prevents interference at the second beamsplitter. Normally, we would need a photon to hit the object to detect its presence. But in this setup, a photon could take the path (a)→(c)→(e), allowing us to detect the object without the photon hitting it! This effect is theoretically useful for taking microscope images of light-sensitive materials, although we don’t yet have any practical microscopes that use this effect.

- Interferometry: When the two paths through the system are not equally long, the probability of photons exiting at (e) varies with the path length difference. This varying probability allows us to measure minuscule changes in distance! Interferometry is used all across science and engineering, particularly in fields like nanofabrication that require extraordinary measurement precision.

Two-Photon Interference

Two-photon interference is like single-photon interference but with – you guessed it – two photons! Instead of sending a single photon through two beamsplitters, this time we send two photons through a single beamsplitter.

I pulled this image from some Nature article.

In general (if the two photons are not identical or enter the beamsplitter at different times), nothing exciting happens. Each photon interacts independently with the beamsplitter, and there’s a 50/50 chance of whether they both exit through the same path.

But when the two photons are identical and enter the beamsplitter at exactly the same time, something truly astounding happens – they always exit through the same path. In other words, they become entangled in space!

Like single-photon interference, two-photon interference happens because photons are waves. Similarly, you can use the restaurant analogy to see why I thought this effect was so ridiculous until I actually observed it in the lab.

The main application of this effect (as far as I know) is to make better interferometers by exploiting the photons’ entanglement to make more precise distance measurements. LIGO used a similar technique to detect gravitational waves back in 2015.

Photon Antibunching

This effect is, in my opinion, the strangest one because I still don’t quite understand it.

The gist is:

- We have a photon source (laser) that we know generates pairs of single photons.

- We use one detector aimed at one of the photon outputs to measure a quantity \(g^{(2)}(0)\) (second-order coherence).

- We expect to get \(g^{(2)}(0) = 0\) because that’s how a single-photon source should behave.

- We get \(g^{(2)}(0) = 1\). Sad.

- We turn on a second detector aimed at the second photon output.

- We magically get \(g^{(2)}(0) = 0\), even though we changed nothing about the source.



Ok, so what does any of this have to do with birds? Not much, to be honest, but I just wanted an excuse to talk about pigeons.

Look at these puffy pigeons I saw a few weeks ago!

Pigeons are amazing creatures and have many talents (like drinking through suction, which surprisingly few other animals can do), but one of their most remarkable skills is navigation. Despite not having access to GPS technology, pigeons almost never get lost when flying home, even when home is hundreds of miles away. This skill is one of the reasons why pigeons are everywhere today – humans have used domesticated pigeons to communicate reliably over long distances as far back as ancient Egypt.

So how do they do it? The short answer is we still don’t quite know for certain. There are plenty of exotic theories out there, ranging from “pigeons can hear magnetic fields” to “pigeons can smell the way home”. Although these theories may well be true and contribute to pigeon navigation, the coolest and most compelling theory (in my opinion) is that pigeons can see magnetic fields, thanks to some special proteins in their eyes called “cryptochromes”.

 Recent evidence suggests that cryptochromes work because of quantum entanglement and another exotic theory called the 
        “quantum Zeno effect”
      
. When blue light hits a cryptochrome, it causes two electrons in the protein to become entangled. The interaction between these electrons and magnetic fields then affects how quickly the protein reacts with other chemicals in the eyes, translating into an optical signal in the brain.

Interestingly, cryptochromes are not specific to pigeons – all birds have them. However, we have also found that cryptochromes in pigeon eyes are much more sensitive to magnetic fields than those in chicken eyes (because chickens rely less on long-distance navigation). This evidence further supports the theory that cryptochromes (and by extension quantum entanglement) is mainly responsible for pigeons’ amazing navigational abilities.

All this to say that pigeons (and I suppose all birds) are quantum magnetic wonders, and we should all appreciate them more.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0333.png

GTL Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 [IAP 2025],Fiona L. '27,0,2025-03-06T00:00:00-05:00,"My 
        GTL
      
 started with the warmest welcomes. On the very first day of the program, I walked through the front entrance of the Shoqan School and was serenaded by a melody played by the elementary schoolers on 
        dombra
      
. They were all wearing traditional clothing, and seemed to have been eagerly waiting the arrival of me and Colin, a PhD student also teaching at Shoqan.

We went into the principal’s office to find a table filled with different Kazakh desserts, 
        baursak
      
, 
        qurt
      
, and fermented horse milk. The fermented horse milk seemed to be a hit or miss among travelers. While I didn’t enjoy the flavor, Colin drank his entire bowl in one gulp! Bakhadir, the principal of Shoqan, gave us a very warm welcome while introducing our roles at Shoqan.

the feast we were welcomed with!

The next day, on Friday, right near the entrance of the school was a table full of more Kazakh snacks. It turns out it was another one of the school’s unique traditions, alongside the national anthem playing every Monday and the students clapping when somebody dropped a plate in the dining hall. 


the modern-looking hallway of shoqan!

the cafe at shoqan

Something I really appreciated about Shoqan was how patriotic the whole school was. Before starting GTL, my vision of private schools in foreign countries was that a lot of them were international schools in an American or British format. Sure, there were plenty of schools like that in 
        Almaty
      
, but Shoqan stayed close to its Kazakh roots. The bell that sounded the end of each class was a traditional melody played on a dombra, and on a tour of the school, I discovered that the school library was built in the shape of a 
        yurt
      
.

The curriculum of the classes adhered to the Kazakh “national curriculum,” and students were expected to know three languages—Russian, Kazakh, and English—by the time they graduated. Although I grew up bilingual, I was envious of the linguistic capabilities of the students at Shoqan. In high school, most American students study only 2-4 years of a foreign language (typically Spanish), while students in Kazakhstan studied all three of these languages from the time they first start school. When it came to foreign language, I felt like 2-4 years wasn’t enough to really retain information long-term.

The week after that was when my teaching really began. I was in charge of teaching classes ranging from English to Math to Physics to Chemistry.

Kazakhstan calculator that i encountered in AP Calc

I enjoyed explaining the concepts and answering the students’ questions. I was surprised how subjects like AP Chemistry and AP Physics suddenly came back to me after years of not studying them. Teaching in another language was definitely a barrier—sometimes, the students would talk amongst themselves or ask the teacher a question in Russian or Kazakh. It felt… uncomfortable to not be able to understand them, even though I knew that they very likely weren’t talking about me.

During the first week, I confided in Arystanbek, a teacher who taught math from grade school up to AP Calculus, about how I felt.

“I explain something to them in English, and then they ask you in Russian and you explain the exact same thing in Russian.” I complained to him.

“And they still don’t listen to me,” he said, a hint of a smile in his eyes.

He added that if they weren’t listening, I shouldn’t be afraid to just tell them how I felt. His words felt strangely encouraging to me. Even as somebody who spoke the language, he knew that students could sometimes be unfocused.

Overall, I also got somewhat of a feeling that my day-to-day experience of teaching was wildly inconsistent. Some days, I had no trouble explaining everything, and some days I was simply “off my game.” Each class of students varied from focused and well behaved to rowdy and off-topic. Especially with the younger students, I felt that teaching was more about classroom management rather than explaining skills.

I think the real gem of the program
 was all the people I got to meet.

I absolutely loved eating lunch with the students and hearing about all their different dreams. I enjoyed their immense interest in my life as an MIT undergrad, and in return, I was very interested in their lives in Kazakhstan. Most of the kids led busy lives and wanted to go abroad for college. Many wanted to come back in order to help Kazakhstan develop further. From Aldiyar, the president of the hiking club who loved collecting fossils; to Mardan; to Ayualym, who wanted to study chemistry and environmental science to help clear up Kazakhstan’s atmosphere, it was a privilege to learn about them, and the many other students I was able to talk to in just three weeks.

In turn, they had a lot of questions for me. Is it hard to study at MIT? How did you get into MIT? What is the best extracurricular I should be doing right now? How do you like Almaty? Have you tried horse meat? [My answers: hard but doable; i dont know :sob: ; whichever one you’re the most interested in; I really like Almaty; yes, it’s pretty good]

the view of almaty from night

My 
        coworkers
      
 also had some interesting stories to share. One of the other college counselors was Robert, an American from Florida who had spent a lot of time working in Russia and Central Asia, and who was also proficient in 10 languages, including Russian and Kazakh.

One of my favorite stories of his was from his time working as an intern for the US Embassy in Cameroon. Somebody had requested a work visa to the US, showing an offer letter for a job at Verizon. To Robert, it looked legit, but his boss rejected it immediately. She later explained to him, taking him to the back office where she compared the offer letter with a bunch of other documents from the embassy. While the other documents were printed in the US, and had the US standard dimension 8.5×11, the offer letter had the global standard dimension A4. If it were a real offer letter from the US, it should’ve been printed in the US. The difference in the dimensions proved it wasn’t.

I was stunned after hearing this story. It convinced me that some people are really just special.

The last week of GTL was the best by far. Although I got sick unexpectedly, and was feeling under the weather the whole week, this was the week when I really put my all into the program, as well as continuing to build the relationships I had been building for the past two weeks, whether I was chatting with teachers during break times or being taken to the pharmacy to get cough drops. In addition, a Kazakh teacher at Shoqan had volunteered to give Colin and me two lessons of Kazakh! The lessons were pretty fast paced, but I was thoroughly grateful for the opportunity to learn.

After having taught with the standard materials for two weeks, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at writing my own problems and assignments for the students. In physics class, I wrote some problems meant to expose 
        misconceptions
      
 with simple harmonic motion and with energy. In chemistry, I taught about galvanic cells, taking a diagram of a galvanic cell from online, and erasing all of the labels except one. I was most proud of my initiative in AP Calculus, where I created a game of Kahoot for the students and wrote a page of u-substitution problems for them. I included a “challenge problem” where I broke solving the problem into multiple small steps.

part of the u-substitution worksheet!

That week, I also went to 
        Daredzani
      
 with Kai Juarez ’27, who was teaching at Haileybury. We really enjoyed the food. I especially liked the 
        khinkali
      
 that I ordered—I typically find food with mushrooms off-putting due to the texture, but I basically inhaled these khinkalis with no reservation about the texture.

While leaving school on Thursday, I bumped into a group of the English teachers, all of whom I’d already met from teaching classes, who were going to play a game of Lord of the Rings trivia. Knowing 
        nothing
      
 about Lord of the Rings, I decided to come with them. There, I had a “mid” bowl of ramen and some excellent conversation. Since they were English teachers, there was no language barrier with them like there was with other teachers. Sometime in the middle of the evening, being engaged in a heated discussion about whether “double dipping” sauce was gross or not. We were all doubled over in laughter, the lights of the bar fresh on on faces and the smell of hookah smoke in the air. I thought to myself, I’m not ready to leave. I felt like the best part of the program had just started.

The last day of school is still fresh in my memory as I’m writing this. I played a game with some seventh graders in an English class and I had a “farewell meeting” with the students and with the faculty. 
 One of the students said that she had only started to understand the concepts in AP Calculus after I had explained them, and that she had really liked the questions I had written for the class. I was very very very touched by her words. In that moment, I though that I would remember that moment for as long as I lived.

After school, I visited Arystanbek, who suggested that I say goodbye to him before leaving. He wanted to give me something, even though his cabinets were full of just papers. I told him he didn’t have to give me anything. But he ultimately decided to give me his red pen. “This is the sign of a teacher,” he told me.

After it got dark, I went to Forum, a nearby mall, with two students. We went to a restaurant in the food court, Lanzhou, that served very 
        tasty
      
 Chinese food. One of the students mentioned how many different types of cuisines there were in Almaty, including Chinese, Korean, Indian, Mexican, and more.

delicious noodles 😋

In elementary school, I had considered becoming a teacher, but decided not to when I found out teachers teach the same thing(s) every year. But during this program, actually playing out the role of a teacher had made me reconsider, yet again. One of the many people I look up to is my AP Stats teacher, who had a long and fruitful career on Wall Street, and started teaching as a “soft retirement” of sorts. I wonder if, after the zenith of my career, life would sway me back towards the direction of my old dream.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bbgI9ES1Sryati1w5KVYpA-1400x1050.jpg

Hydranting My Spring Semester,Jessica Z. '27,3,2025-03-05T00:00:00-05:00,"My mind has been struggling to internalize the scary fact that it’s been ~1.5 years since I came to MIT. Fall finals season helped me shove those feelings to the side, but now that spring classes have started, it feels like the clock is ticking louder than ever and choosing classes feels a lot heavier :<

All this to say, I’ve been browsing
        Hydrant
      
 and
        Courseroad
      
for an abysmal amount of time
        post-finals
      
and thought I’d share my very, very, very messy process for
        deciding my sophomore spring classes! 
      


First, here’s some background and my preliminary thoughts for planning my classes:

Course Requirements:

- I’m planning to double major in
        Course 20
      
and
        15-1.
      


- I planned to double in Course 20 and
        STS
      
last year before switching the latter to 15-1. I also toyed around with
        3
      
or
        2A-20
      
before realizing that I didn’t like nanomaterials or physics enough to commit to either, even if I really like biomaterials and biomedical devices. I essentially went in a giant loop back to Course 20 :^)

- If you know me personally, there’s a 99% chance I’ve complained about the Course 20 requirements. I personally think it’s an atrocious amount of classes and way too difficult to schedule
        one of the less flexible majors,
      
which makes it difficult to plan since I’m also trying to fit my HASS requirement in alongside 15-1 classes. That means there are certain technical classes I basically have to take next semester :(

HASS Concentration:

- I really, really like a lot of the
        HASS
      
fields here, and as a result, I’ve considered a lot of different concentrations:
        CMS,
      
Education,
        STS
      
, and
        ACT.
      


- I took 
        STS.011
      
and
        CMS.100
      
last year and
        17.307
      
this year. I’m leaning towards a concentration in STS but not super super set.

- I also need to take my second
        CI-H/W
      
this semester. I’d like to take a CI-H/W that counts for my HASS concentration, which makes scheduling a bit more difficult considering I’m not entirely set on what I’d like to concentrate in.

With all that in mind, let’s get started!

I start planning my semester by not looking at the class times in Hydrant. Instead, I add every class that I have to take for my course requirements next semester (sans CI-H), then some required classes I’d like to take earlier rather than later if I have the space.

Afterwards, my schedule looked like this:

yikes

I started poking around MIT’s
        Course Catalog
      
 to read the class descriptions and started going down a rabbit hole of classes that also seemed interesting. So… I added a few more classes.

In the middle of my browsing, my friend pointed out that Prof. Erik Demaine is teaching an origami class this semester. In high school, my research focused on the intersections between origami and biomedical devices. I learned in college that my interests have shifted, but I still have a deep admiration for origami as a field of study. In fact, I mentioned his research in my very first high school science fair project, which helps illustrate how much I appreciate the field—needless to say, I spontaneously added his class to my schedule, too.

I spent a few minutes scrolling through Hydrant to add any class title that seemed interesting, barring they didn’t have a lot of pre-reqs and didn’t seem overly technical at first glance. Then… my friend messaged me with some other interesting classes he stumbled upon during his own Hydrant-ing, which I promptly added to my own.

Finally, ta-da! Version 1 of my spring semester schedule was done:

yikes x2

This version was just to lay out which classes were available and seemed interesting without any considerations of actual feasibility. It’s a lot to see on one page, so I broke it down into a quick list by category:

Essential Classes: These are required classes for Course 20 and 15-1 that
        I have to take
      
now to stay on track for my major requirements and future courses.

- 6.100B: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

- 7.03: Genetics

- 7.05: General Biochemistry

- 8.02: Physics II

Flexible Classes: These are required classes that I had originally planned for my junior and senior year but could hypothetically take next semester.

- 15.501: Corporate Financial Accounting

- 15.8141: Marketing Innovation

- 15.9001: Competitive Strategy

- 18.05: Introduction to Probability and Statistics

HASS Electives: These are some classes I found that fulfill HASS requirements (* = CI-H/W).

- 4.021: Design Studio: How to Design

- 4.657: Design: The History of Making Things

- 21T.232: Producing Podcasts

- 21W.035: Science Writing and New Media: Elements of Science Writing for the Public*

- 21W.031: Science Writing and New Media: Explorations in Communicating about Science and Technology*

- 21W.778: Science Journalism

- CMS.587/11.125: Introduction to Education: Understanding and Evaluating Education

- CMS.636: Extending the Museum

- STS.034: Science Communication: A Practical Guide

- STS.049: The Long War Against Cancer

- STS.055: Living Dangerously: Environmental Problems from 1900 to Today

Misc Interests: Some other assorted classes that caught my eye :)

- 6.5310: Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra

- 7.105: Ethics for Biologists and Engineers

- 20.586: Science and Business of Biotechnology

- 20.310: Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics

Stage 1: Denial

Surely there is some way to make this schedule work where I can take classes I enjoy, fulfill my course requirements without stressing myself out, and miraculously still survive! Right? I’ll start by working on all of the non-HASS classes and quickly eliminating the ones that fall to the bottom of the list after a second look:

- 6.100B: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

- 7.03: Genetics

- 7.05: General Biochemistry

- 8.02: Physics II

- 15.501: Corporate Financial Accounting

- 15.8141: Marketing Innovation

- 15.9001: Competitive Strategy

- 18.05: Introduction to Probability and Statistics

- 6.5310: Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra I never seriously considered taking this class simply because I cannot code for the life of me, BUT I’m going to listener one class

- 7.105: Ethics for Biologists and Engineers

- 20.586: Science and Business of Biotechnology

- 20.310: Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics

And now HASS classes…

- 4.021: Design Studio: How to Design

- 4.657: Design: The History of Making Things*

- 21T.232: Producing Podcasts* I think podcast production is very cool, and I would love to learn more about it; I just like the other classes listed more.

- 21W.035: Science Writing and New Media: Elements of Science Writing for the Public*

- 21W.031: Science Writing and New Media: Explorations in Communicating about Science and Technology*

- 21W.778: Science Journalism*

- CMS.587/11.125: Introduction to Education: Understanding and Evaluating Education*

- CMS.636: Extending the Museum

- STS.034: Science Communication: A Practical Guide*

- STS.049: The Long War Against Cancer*

- STS.055: Living Dangerously: Environmental Problems from 1900 to Today I think this was on my list because it would count for my STS concentration? Eliminated because I prefer the other STS classes though.

My five-minute run-through eliminated a grand total of 4 classes…out of the 23 originally listed.

yay for progress ..??

The delusion is always strong with Hydrant.

Stage 2: Anger

I knew STS.034 was the class I wanted to take the most. But after checking my schedule, it wouldn’t be possible to take with 6.100B. I checked if I could take the Course 20 coding alternative class, but I would have to push off until my junior year, in which case would also push back my lab classes.

That’s when the frustration kicked in. I (very unhelpfully) started thinking about how I should have tried to take 6.100B earlier or should have forced myself to do a coding class in high school. Somewhere along the lines, though, the anger got some-what productive. I didn’t solve my STS.034/6.100B scheduling conflict, but I did eliminate a bunch of other classes if they weren’t particularly urgent.

- 15.501: Corporate Financial Accounting

- 15.8141: Marketing Innovation

- 15.9001: Competitive Strategy

- 7.105: Ethics for Biologists and Engineers

- 20.586: Science and Business of Biotechnology

- 20.310: Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics

- 4.021: Design Studio: How to Design

- 4.657: Design: The History of Making Things* I WILL take a
        Course 4
      
class before leaving MIT, it just won’t be this year. The course 4 classes hurt extra to delete.

The classes still in the running:

- 6.100B: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

- 7.03: Genetics

- 7.05: General Biochemistry

- 8.02: Physics II

- 18.05: Introduction to Probability and Statistics

- 21W.035: Science Writing and New Media: Elements of Science Writing for the Public*

- 21W.031: Science Writing and New Media: Explorations in Communicating about Science and Technology*

- 21W.778: Science Journalism*

- CMS.587/11.125: Introduction to Education: Understanding and Evaluating Education*

- CMS.636: Extending the Museum

- STS.034: Science Communication: A Practical Guide*

- STS.049: The Long War Against Cancer*

Which brings our stage 2, post-anger Courseroad to… drum-roll please…

yikes x3

Stage 3: Bargaining

Some quick things I did in a desperate attempt to solve my STS.034/6.100B conflict (in varying levels of seriousness):

- Asked my advisor if pushing off my coding requirement was advisable

- Emailed my future lab classes to see if 6.100B was a strict pre-req

- Tried about 219438 different Courseroad schedules with 20.S901 in my junior year and STS.034 this semester

- Considered switching out of Course 20

- Considered signing up for both classes and only attending one lecture

Stage 4: Depression Disappointment

Depressions a bit of a strong word for this, so I changed it to strong disappointment. My bargaining didn’t get me very far, and it became pretty clear I’d have to make a decision when one of the 20.320 lab staff emailed me back kindly explaining it would be realllyyyy hard for me to take 6.100B as a co-req instead of a pre-req because all the psets involved coding :'(

In a last ditch desperate attempt to take STS.034 and 20.S901 instead of 6.100B, I spend an abysmal amount of time on Courseroad trying to make it work :’)

At the end, though, there were some other things I realized:

- I’m interning this Spring

- I’d like to blog more

- I want to dedicate more time to my classes and clubs

- I want to put a lot of energy into Ring Committee

- The last semesters have been busy, busy, busy, and I’d like to have more time for myself and new hobbies

All of this circled back to an inevitable truth that always seems to repeat itself to me, although I’m not sure when I’ll fully accept it: I need more time, and that means not doing everything I’d like to.

Stage 5: Acceptance

The last stage, acceptance, came with swallowing a few more hard truths I think I always knew:

- I simply cannot expect to do 60 units and
        perform as well as I’d like.
      


- A secondary to that: I would like to not drop a class, and the best way for me to reach that goal is to not over-register myself.

- I need to take 6.100B. It’s not practical to take the Course 20 Spring version, especially when the course description recommends some coding experience beforehand. I also know that pushing off 6.100B would only make me more stressed :’)

With that, I felt good enough to finalize my schedule. Presenting (finally!) my Spring Hydrant:

isn’t she beautiful :’)

Can’t wait to rinse and repeat next semester!

All jokes aside, it’s a bit daunting to think about how it’s my sophomore spring. I’m only have two more IAPs, two more fall semesters, two more CPWs left… the list goes on.

The largest hard truth: there’s simply not enough time on campus to do everything I want to do. I have a lot of ramblings about MIT, the good and bad, but I also have
        a loooonnggg list of things I want to do before I graduate.
      
I’ve been away from blogging because of some personal matters, but I’m back, and I’m excited to see how this semester goes :^)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-5.23.44%E2%80%AFPM-400x265.png

[Guest Post] An Overthinker’s Guide to Finishing Your Transfer Application,Jeremy W.,1,2025-03-04T00:00:00-05:00,"The fall transfer application deadline is coming up. I tried to remember how I was feeling last year when the deadline was coming up…and then I remembered that I submitted my application in January. Last spring I was both working in the Navy full-time and attending college full-time, so I had to budget my time carefully. I made the plan to do most of my application work during winter break so I could devote my full attention to it. In early January, I realized that even though I could return to and edit my application endlessly (at least until March), the edits I was making weren’t a good use of my time and weren’t making my application any better. I got some good advice from a friend and they helped me understand that I had already spent the right amount of time working on it.

Since I started at MIT, I’ve had a bunch of folks ask me for application advice. There is already a bunch of great advice on this blog, but with the deadline nearing I thought I’d add my two cents. Disclaimer: I do not work in admissions or read applications for a living (though I did ask someone who does to look at this before publishing *cough cough* Jeremy 👀).

Without further ado, and in no particular order, here’s some advice and resources that I found helpful while applying:

- Don’t over-edit your application or ask too many people (especially strangers) to read through your essays. Before you know it, your friend Susie is changing all of your essays to passive voice. The most important part is your distinctive voice, and if you edit the essay into the ground you’ll lose that. This will also be true if you use AI to write your essays.

- Give yourself time (after writing) to step away from your essays. You can’t do this if you procrastinate until the last minute. Doing this gives your brain a chance to subconsciously process whatever you’re writing about. This can help you be more introspective, which is ultimately the most important part of this process.

- There is such a thing as a bad essay. In my case, my bad essays came from a place of not having fully processed some of the things I was trying to write about. It’s okay to completely scrap that idea and go back to the drawing board. Even if a story or experience is compelling on its face, it might not be the best thing to write about.

- Introspection can be pretty hard to do. One of the things that helped me think about my values, experiences, and what was important to me was listening to other people talk about what’s important to them. One of the best places to listen to others’ stories is on NPR’s “This I Believe” series and NPR’s StoryCorps. Do not take the ideas or stories of others. Rather, imagine NPR invited you to either write an essay about what you believe or imagine what story you would tell to StoryCorps.

- Don’t exaggerate on your activities. Another way to say this is: what you have done is enough. There are only so many hours in a week. Everyone needs down time. Don’t compromise all the effort you’ve put into your application (and your integrity) by being disingenuous.

- If you’re applying to transfer, chances are you’re applying to more than one school. Don’t fall into the trap of the “dream school.” There are many places you could be happy studying (if you’d only let yourself).

- Don’t trash your current school in your application. You’ve probably got important reasons for wanting to transfer. My biggest reason was that, having been stationed in Hawaii and Guam for the past 8 years in the Navy, I wanted to be closer to my family while I finished my education. But while studying at Kapi’olani Community College, Leeward Community College, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I had excellent professors that were giving me a world-class education. I formed friendships there that’ll last a lifetime. I was active in my community on and off campus. If you’re not doing that at your current school, you’re probably not making the best use of your time there.

- The essay I struggled with the most during the application was the “Why MIT?” essay: “Please discuss why you are considering transferring from your current college or university, and how MIT aligns with your goals.” The best advice I got about how to answer this came from the Yale Admissions Podcast, which is an excellent resource for essay writing. To paraphrase Episode 6: How did your journey lead you to apply here? What specific experiences did you have that made you decide to put all this effort into a transfer application? Don’t write a list of information about MIT. The admissions officers already know all that stuff! Try to center the story on you. Looking back and being introspective tends to be more insightful than looking forward and saying “This is what I’m gonna do when I go to MIT!” Frankly, a lot of the folks here will be a little disappointed if you stick too closely to one path when you get here. College is about exploring! So give the admissions office a window into your curious mind. Show them some of the things that excite you and how transferring to MIT can continue the journey you’re on.

“Please discuss why you are considering transferring from your current college or university, and how MIT aligns with your goals.”

Show them some of the things that excite you and how transferring to MIT can continue the journey you’re on.

- At this point in the application cycle, most of what you’ve done to transfer to MIT has been completed. Standardized tests are taken. Course grades are on your transcript. Don’t shortchange yourself by having an incomplete or late application. It’s understandable if a recommendation letter or college report doesn’t get submitted right on time. There’s a grace period for that. But at some point, if a lot of your application is missing or late, it says something about your desire to transfer to a school (or your organizational skills).

Good luck, y’all! Transferring is a stressful process, and you’re showing a lot of grit and resilience just by applying. To all the folks who are working full-time, military veterans, my fellow public university and community college students—I’ve been where you’re at. Transferring to MIT is possible, and I look forward to meeting y’all this fall. Godspeed.",,0
ms paint sidequest,Kayode D. '27,17,2025-03-04T00:00:00-05:00,"Hallo! 

My friend, Caleb M. ‘27 and I are currently in the MIT Student Center, and we need to be working. 

I’m currently working on an assignment for 2.007, which was due Sunday night at Midnight. I’ll explain more about the class in my next blog, to be posted this week, but this is what work I’ve accomplished tonight: 

I CADed up this piece for my robot in the last hour. I call this “The Finger,” because it’s what I will use to grip and switch a lever back and forth. It’s attached to a beam I’ll call “The Arm”, and a base I’ll call… well I don’t really have a name for that. I’ve just been referring to this robot as “Big Man,” so I guess that’s what I’ll call it. 

Here’s the prototype I built in lab today. It uses two rubber bands to create a one-way door to catch hold onto the levers. Pretty neat!!

I’m not sure what Caleb is supposed to be working on. 

We currently have only one laptop charger and both of our laptops are near dead. 

The Sidequest: 

Yesterday, I made a comment on Ellie’s Fantastic Blog, in which I quickly edited together this image in MS Paint: 



After this, I wondered if it would be possible to make a program that could put any image into this little frame for you. It would be neat if it also lowered the resolution by a bit, and matched the colors to the closest ones in the default ms paint color palette. It might take some time, but this could also be done to a video if done correctly. The more I thought about it, the more I thought it was definitely possible. 

About an hour ago, I told this idea to my friend, Caleb M. ‘27, who is also here. We started talking and he said that it is most definitely possible, and possible in under an hour. 

I’m currently***** taking 6.101, a coding class at MIT. One of our most recent assignments was an image modulation lab, and we did a lot with modifying image pixel colors and locations. It was honestly a really hard lab, but we realized that basically all of the framework needed to make this happen [also, Caleb did really well in that class so he can do all of the coding and i can do all of the blogging :[]  ]

We both stopped working, and since I’ve started writing this blog about our little ms paint sidequest, Caleb has finished modifying the first video!

I chose this one i found by searching for “dancing old man” on google: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4FuPdMskeI 

Here’s the output we got: 

It works!! We immediately noticed that it is very desaturated. 

TAKEAWAYS for next time: 

- Wider color palette

- Better function for choosing the closest color.

- More vibrant video

next time:

This time we used a more colorful video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzKURp_OJV0

…

it’s 1:50 now. here’s caleb with the lowdown of what’s goin’ on:

Hi there. So if you’ve taken or are taking 6.101, you may remember the lab Image Processing 2. In that lab, we wrote various functions that allowed us to manipulate images, messing with the colors, applying filters, things like that. Because I didn’t want to write all of this stuff anew, I decided to directly use my lab from 3 semesters ago, which gave me access to a handful of functions to manipulate images. So my thought process was:

1. Divide a video into a series of frames,

2. Edit each frame as an image to match the color scheme of MS Paint using the functions in the lab, and

3. Stich the frames back together in the video.

To do step 1, I used Windows Powershell with an ffmpeg command to split the video into a bunch of frames. Easy. No Exclamation Point, or parentheses for this statement. Sorry. Anyway: In Image Processing 2, we wrote a helper called apply_per_pixel that let us pass in an image and a function to apply to each colored pixel and then would produce a new image with that filter applied. I wanted the filter to choose the closest color from the MS Paint Windows Vista color palette, so I wrote a short helper function that initially compared the sum of the absolute differences between the Red, Green, and Blue values of the pixel at hand to each MS Paint color and return the one with the smallest sum, which I imagined yield the “closest color.” This approach, however, returned us with the first video, where many pixels just became grey. I realized that the simple sum of the differences wasn’t the most effective method to find how close each color was, so I instead replaced this with the Euclidian Distance between the MS Paint Color and the color of the pixel, imagining each color as a 3D Vector: sqrt[[r2-r1]^2 + [b2-b1]^2 + [b2-b1]^2]. This was a much stronger approach that yielded a much more colorful result exclamation point. I then made a loop to read each frame from the folder that I saved them into, apply_per_pixel the helper to choose and apply the closest MS Paint color and construct a new image, and then save that into a new file. Step 2 complete exclamation point. Finally, I returned to my trusty Powershell and ffmpeg to stitch all the frames back together, completing Step 3 and returning our final video [okay and then I used Premiere for the MS Paint frame but whatever that’s not the cool part]. Yeah. I’ve got so much work to do tonight. Caleb out.

 

ok. we did it. here it is:

ok. i’m going to sleep. thank you all of joining us.

Bad Ideas Month,Ellie F. '28,10,2025-03-03T00:00:00-05:00,"I’m no cook when it comes to normal food, but if stupid ideas were dishes, I’d be head chef of a Michelin-starred restaurant (or at least I’d like to think so). Unfortunately, at MIT, most of my computational power has been devoted to “psets” and “midterms” and not Silly Girl Time, but when the Bad Ideas Weekend email (and subsequent reminder email) hit my inbox like [redacted], I knew it was showtime. 

Every year, during three days in 
        IAP
      
, Bad Ideas Weekend takes hold in MIT like glitter: it’s everywhere, if you look hard enough, and it catches the light, even in the dark. Students run activities silly and absurd and sometimes delicious, and even more students emerge to bake rat-shaped cakes and play IRL Fruit Ninja and take their minds off the constant demands of an MIT education. Bad Ideas Weekend was my calling. I sent in two event proposals, and thought nothing more of it for two months.



One Month Before Bad Ideas

I had a plan for IAP. A blissful period of rest, exploring Boston museums, baking desserts, learning to ice skate and drawing murals and spending my evenings with my friends. Sure, I had a 
        UROP
      
 that would take up most of my time during the day, and I also needed to finish a homework packet for my 
        18.03 ASE
      
, but I’d still have more than enough time to get my fill of goofing around before the hell of spring semester started.



The first Bad Idea I was running was Huge Ping Pong. I don’t know if you noticed, but Normal Ping Pong is really hard. Those paddles are so small, and I keep missing! The solution, obviously, is to make giant paddles, which would solve all my ping-pong-related problems. And though I had no idea where to host my event, or where to get the wood, or even how to use any power tools whatsoever, I was confident that my half-baked idea would end up working.



Three Weeks Before Bad Ideas

IAP started off just how I imagined. In the first week, I practiced a beautiful piano piece, started learning glassblowing, rehearsed for a Video Game Orchestra Tetris performance, and explored the Institute for Contemporary Art. It was heaving, until Sunday, when I realized I had worked about ten hours less than I was planning. And I hadn’t even touched 18.03.



 

In a desperate moment of clarity, I sat down to meticulously plan out every hour of my day the next week. Mornings and afternoons were dedicated to my UROP, and evenings were for 18.03 and miscellaneous responsibilities. Then, the MIT Mystery Hunt suddenly consumed four days of my life, and I was left with one week to finish about two-thirds of a giant homework packet.

My second Bad Idea was S’mores with 
        Various Questionable Sources of Fire
      
. It was yet another event I was wholly unprepared for–the most fire safety training I’ve done has been Stop Drop and Roll back in elementary school. Sadly, the event was axed for safety reasons, or so I thought. Just a few days before Bad Ideas Weekend, I was suddenly notified that s’mores was back on, but without all the fire-making contraptions. And we had no supplies. I called an emergency meeting, and my co-conspirator Caroline and I decided, in a last-minute change of plans, to make our event now centered around 
        gourmet smores
      
.



 

Three Days Before Bad Ideas

At this point, things are dire for my ASE. We cook up a plan.

Mission Don’t Fail 18.03:

- work all day, every day

- stop cooking. Order Uber eats 

- leaving your room is for losers 

- stop watching YouTube and also having friends and also contacting the outside world

The first few days went alright. Although my back hurt and my legs were probably atrophying from disuse, I was definitely making progress. Not as much as I had hoped, sure, but still enough to be on track to finish. And then…



Dawn of Bad Ideas Weekend

Saturday brought with it the s’mores event, and though the 18.03 exam was drawing nearer, the need to stuff my face with marshmallows was too strong. After all, I deserved a little treat. Caroline had bought the supplies, and when I arrived, we started toasting marshmallows. Among our spread of gourmet choices was Peeps, jelly-filled marshmallows, Nutella, strawberry jam, Feastables, and slices of whole wheat bread.

MIT Science Olympiad happened to be holding its awards ceremony right next door, so I’d go into Kresge Auditorium’s lobby to advertise free s’mores, and like the Pied Piper, I’d leave with a gaggle of high schoolers trailing behind me. Within an hour and a half, our supplies had run out, but a gaggle of my friends stayed to chat and poke at the fire. Ian offered to buy free boba from Teado, and while we were there, Liong, in the interest of Bad Ideas, ordered a water boba, setting off a microtrend to the amusement and befuddlement of the barista.

When we walked back outside, we were treated to the sight of a steaming trash can that would have definitely been labeled as carcinogenic in California. In the confused aftermath, we carried a table down and up a flight of stairs, but we eventually got everything squared away. All in all, no injuries were had, and also I got to embezzle a mostly full jar of Nutella from the event, so it was a huge win.

 

I didn’t get that much work done for 18.03 that night, but I did eat a hefty amount of Nutella.



Bright and early next morning was my ping pong event. Although some wood was allocated for the paddles, I realized it wouldn’t work well, so I snatched the largest sheet of wood I could find at 
        Reuse
      
. I explained to a Metropolis mentor my predicament (no training with any woodworking or power tools oops!), and they recommended I use the laser cutter. We traced out a paddle shape, and after some debugging, both paddles were cut out!

It was then that I realized we didn’t have a ball. I took a trip back to Simmons and pilfered a few balls from the ballpit, one of which we spray painted white. We put some finishing touches on the painted paddles and headed outside to play. Unfortunately, giant ping pong is not easier than regular ping pong :(

That evening, I finally finished my 18.03 homework packet, with a day to spare. Still, I felt my grasp on all the concepts, especially the earlier ones, was shaky at best. I spent one more day forcing myself to work through as many practice exams as I could, feeling my confidence repeatedly build and crumble with every problem I got correct or incorrect.

In the end, it all worked out. Despite not having any woodworking skills, I successfully made ping pong paddles. Despite cancellations and last minute changes, s’mores ran smoothly. And despite procrastinating on and underestimating the difficulty of 18.03, I managed to pass the ASE. It’s a boost to my confidence, I suppose, but I mostly look back on my IAP as a lesson in what not to do. I overcommitted myself, took on too much unnecessary stress, and I paid the price mentally. I’ve now promised myself to use IAP to explore new hobbies, be with my friends, and relax, and overall, not turn Bad Ideas Weekend into Bad Ideas Month. Check back in next year to see if it worked!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iap-sketch-1.png

Night at da Opera,Kayode D. '27,5,2025-03-01T00:00:00-05:00,"This semester, I’m taking a class called 21.01, “Love, Death, and Taxes”. It’s a 
        CI-H
      
 philosophy class, and it’s a grand old time! The class looks at moral and social questions concerning the human experience, and is set up in a discussion-focused style with debates and discourse. One of my big pulls for the class, though, were the field trips. That’s right. Field trips. In 2025. In College. Yep. 

Me on a pumpkin patch field trip in elementary school. Ah, the glory days.

The class is a lot of fun! We talk about things like what separates 
        an aggregation from an association
      
, and what makes someone a 
        genius
      
.

I also met some pretty neat people! My friends, Jessie L. 27’ and Pierre C. are taking the class with me, and we discuss philosophy and values and the the human condition together. We also watched the Super Bowl! When the TAs sent out the form announcing the field trip options, we agreed to go to all three [an opera, a concert, and a play] together. 

But let’s be real. I had no idea what I signed up for with this opera thing. I didn’t know where it was, when it was, I didn’t even really know what an opera was. Like conceptually I understood, but I had no idea what it actually entailed. I just got in the uber and ended up somewhere in Boston with a ticket. When we sat down I asked someone how long this was supposed to be, and they told me FOUR HOURS. I signed up for FOUR HOURS of a thing I didn’t even understand! And the orchestra didn’t even have any drums! Only 
        timpani’s
      
!

We went to see the opera “Lysistrata, or The Nude Goddess” at Jordan Hall in Boston. Luckily, it wasn’t four hours straight of percussion-less orchestra music, and actors came out a few minutes in. The play was written by Mark Adamo in the early 2000s as an adaptation of the original Lysistrata, written by Aristophanes in 411 BC. This new version is thankfully in English and adapted to make more sense in modern times, and I enjoyed it!  

Essentially, the opera is about the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. The women of both cities think that the war is foolish and they’ll end up killing each other senselessly, so they agree to lock themselves in the Athens armory and not have sex or spend any time with any of their husbands until they end the war. At first this seemed stupid, since the characters even pointed out that there were prostitutes in the town, so the men wouldn’t comply, but it actually worked. It wasn’t just the flesh desires, but they also longed to be with their wives. It made them question which they loved more, their feud or their wives.

There was a lot of back and forth, and eventually even the women wondered which they loved more: peace or their husbands. The women renamed Lysia, the woman who started the movement,  to be “Lysistrata” which means “disbander of armies,” even though she had decided in herself to leave the cause to be with her husband.

Eventually, the men showed that they loved their wives more than the war, and wanted to end the fighting to be with them. However after everything had been resolved and they were writing up the treaty over a feast, another fight broke out. This ended with the generals stabbing one another and both falling dead. Their wives rush to their sides, see their husbands are dead and pull the knifes out, turning to face one another. Plot Twist!! Now THEY are the ones fighting the war senselessly!

At the end of the play, in true Deus Ex Machina fashion, the gods Aphrodite and Ares descended to the people to end their war. I think it was a Rick and Morty reference, but I’m not quite sure. 

The Final Curtain Call

After the opera, we went to get tacos from El Jefe’s across the street. Delicioso!

It also snowed like, a bunches. 

…

 

One thing we’ve talked about a lot in our class is values. In one exercise, we wrote out all of the things we value and why we value them, and drew connecting lines back to find the core values [you might value hard work, and you value that because you value being useful, which is because you value helping people, because you value love]. I wrote things like Honesty, Loyalty, and Growth, and everything connected back to my relationship with God and how He has worked in me the last few months. The bible sets the groundwork and frame for who I want to become and be. 

Looking at that list, I could see a noticeable shift from my values when I came to MIT. If you asked me before coming to MIT or during freshman year what I valued I would say things like getting a good job, or accomplishing some big MIT thing, or doing something worth being remembered for. Now I think I value a lot less what I accomplish while in college and more the person that I become while in college. I was so obsessed with reaching some unseen, unreachable goal that would suddenly make my feel accomplished and satisfied that I didn’t think about the person I was or who I was becoming. I wasn’t growing. 

Now, I realize that MIT is a marathon, not a sprint. I don’t have to run the same pace as the guys in the front or the guy who set the world record for marathon, I just have to keep going and be the best runner I can be. It took a lot of experiences to come to this realization, but I’m glad that I changed my focus to my self, rather than what I do.

OK, that’s enough deep thinking for today. I never know how to end a blog. Bye.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Opera-Baby-1.jpg

[live blog] BLUEPRINT 2025,Janet G. '27,3,2025-03-01T00:00:00-05:00,"goooooood MORNING YALL 🌞🌞🌞

…is what i told my team at 6:30am in the morning after staying up until 1am (skull emoji – selena) to sort out the final logistics for our event today.

It’s March 1st, which means a few things:

- spring is coming up

- 1/6th of the year has gone (already??)

- the weather is getting WARM

- 
        BLUEPRINT 2025 
      
 IS HAPPENING!!

anyway. i’m the director of blueprint, so i am a little busy, but i’ve asked some of my lovely team members to give updates and let you guys know what we’re up to. the theme this year is bakery, and everything is SO CUTE so we’re going to try get you guys some photos too.

i’ll sign off now. the team will introduce themselves as they give live blog updates, but we’re super excited to have the kids here (and have you follow along what we’re doing!!)

hi!!! i’m sabrina and i’m a part BluePrint’s dev team. this is my third blueprint(bp) cycle and even after surviving through all the previous hackathons/cycle, this bp is still one of the cutest yet.

- We started BluePrint with an introduction by our fearless leader, Janet, and Ashley, who were adorned by the cutest rat hats (irl Ratatouille fr!). we just finished a resounding performance by resonance which was lit.

- I’m so obsessed with all the bakery themed EVERYTHING from the slides to the sweatshirts to the cute chalked drawings on the boards. while the theme is making me a bit hungry, there was (thankfully) catered breaky from Flour!

- there were many laughs from sanjith and timmy’s bird demo for the blueprint meme competition. it was silly, but in the best way possible, and i am hyped to see all the memes that the highschoolers make!

- next some members and i taught the game dev workshop! (detailed as more below by evan~~) it was so cute to see all the high schoolers so eager to participate and honestly it reminds me of why I do hackmit in the first place <3

Resonance performance at Blueprint opening ceremony!!

HI i’m selena (snoc) and i’m a member of blueprint’s marketing team. janet has relinquished full control of her computer to us so teresa is dumping it in the charles. hack is lit and awesome. kimberly is wondering if tech talks are happening right now and izzy just stuck me in a tiktok.

half of the marketing team is lowk just sitting around a table drawing and stealing lunch because we are old and locked out and also “researching for social media” (doomscrolling tiktok) but also this is what we were hired to do T.B.H.

Hi i’m evan and i’m on blueprint’s dev team. i just finished watching / helping out with the game dev workshop taught by adam jenny sabrina and edward! i got to help out one person with their git repo so that was nice ;D. i also just ate lunch — we got al’s sandwiches which are pretty good! i had the roast beef w/ cheese. the bread was crunchy but the meat was a little chewy (6.8/10). janets a great director but she doesn’t let me get extra chocolates.

jenny (hi! i’m a crusty old hack alum who is teaching game dev this blueprint with the above) and sabrina taking over now! janet gave us the task of interviewing a couple of bp attendees so let’s hear some of their thoughts :O take it straight from them what bp is actually like:

- “REALLY FUN”

- “I liked the talk! We went to the Hack Club talk and it was funny but he still explained it well”

- “It’s fun to meet new people”

- “Looking forward to workshops and making a final project :D”

- “The swag is top-tier!!!!!!!!!!!”

- “Love the organization fair — it’s super cool to see what organizations there are and talking to them”

- “The stickers are really cute” (guys marketing always pops off so hard)

now that we’ve heard some from of the students, let’s see what hack team members think! ft. mostly 
        hack alums
      
 oops

- our fearless 
        logs
      
 leader dom: “it’s very fun! but chaotic – the tech talks are super funny and the memes keep coming”

- hannaz: “food is good”

- emily: “i feel really old” (it’s ok us too)

- richard: “i love al’s cafe… prosciutto sandwich”

- alison: “hardware is advanced”

- teresa: “i can’t let them know i’m running on 4 hours of sleep” (mkt is so hardworking 🥹)

that’s enough from us old ppl. time hand off it off to some current members!

hi we’re srilekha and wendy and we’re fallabies (joined team this past fall) :))) we’re currently on butt-on-a-chair mode and i had too much caffeine and we’re psetting and i’m going insane :) we’ve just gone through the 5 stages of grief looking at a graph and came up with some amazing computer science theories

- how can we make a tree simpler and have less children? give it some birth control/practice abstinence

- breadth first search is simply an interpretive dance. why have a computer when you can perform it yourself

- please don’t ever ask us to write an adjacency list because we cant

we love sandwiches and blueprint :)

hi janet – sanjith (who can’t say anything else or else it would be [redacted])

now we’re going to pass it to our lovely SPRINGABIES YAYYY (ppl who joined this spring aka last week and have been super helpful even tho they have no idea whats going on!!)

hey chat, we’re david and audrey and we’re SPRINGABIES

^^ we just joined hack and we are here for the vibes. also psetting and locking in for midterms coming up :) food is good (flour pastry buffet <3 for breakfast and sandwiches for lunch), energy is good, team is slaying. word of advice: take 6.1200 on PNR freshman fall.

hiiii im dom and im the logistics head for blueprint!

i started the day bright and early at 7am at the stud (the student center) to help move all our merch, food, and hardware to stata. after two trips we brought 500 mandarins, 40 laptops, 3 boxes of crewnecks and a bajillion chip boxes

check in was wild – so many people came! it was a huge influx and we were all running around but once we got settled in, it was amazing!

the opening ceremony was slay, the workshops were amazing, and the tech talks were so funny and cool! currently at orgs fair right now with the team and talking to all the students is super fun

currently, am trading pokemon tcg with team though so you could say im taking a little break…

hi I’m kevin! I’m with shrey and gaurab yo whats up blueprint is goated and team is very lit especially gaurab

Hiii I am gaurab and team is very lit especially Shrey!

The first day of Blueprint is now completed. I have to admit, liveblogging with a whole team is a little harder than we expected, but it was very fun! We can’t really give you the full details, but highlights include:

- 200+ cups of boba, with support from TenOne Teahouse (yay)

- this exact version of rat remy headbands 

- trying to catch balloons that flew everywhere (rip)

- lots of very expert art made by various members of team (will post tomorrow)

- incredible workshops where everyone learned (including myself) and had a lot of fun

it was great. see you tomorrow!

hiiii dis joyce (crusty alum) and soo happy to see how the team this year baked up such a loaf-ly blueprint 🍞

Okay so apparently running a hackathon is really busy and difficult and so we actually didn’t get to write very much RIP. but Elena B. ’28 my goat did a write-up of the last few moments and she did a GREAT job so you can read this and pretend this was representative of like the entire hackathon day i guess

hi!! I’m Elena & I’m a 
        springabie

Tour de Frat,Emiko P. '25,9,2025-02-28T00:00:00-05:00,"Welcome back to another tour – and I hope you’re excited, because this one is gonna be fun. Today we will be going on a tour of three different MIT fraternities! Fraternities existing at MIT may seem like a crazy concept, but what’s even crazier is that we actually have 26 of them in total! A lot of my friends ended up joining frats freshman year, so I thought it would be fun to show what Greek life is like for them. (You can see the tour of sororities here too, if you’re interested)

Without further ado, let’s embark on our Tour de Frat!

Phi Beta Epsilon

First up is Phi Beta Epsilon! Right next to the tennis courts and other athletic fields, it’s on the same street as a bunch of other dorms on campus. Here to give us a tour is Ethan R. ‘25, a member of the lacrosse team, and AZ ‘26, a member of the soccer team!

PBE House Quick Facts

- Inhabitants: 42

what makes fear worth it,Kai V. '25,7,2025-02-27T00:00:00-05:00,"Despite being a brief and shallow fan of Hamilton in middle school, I didn’t fully grasp the concept of musical theater until college. Hamilton, to me, existed as a series of songs someone had compiled in a YouTube playlist. Somehow everyone in the comments was stringing together a coherent plot from these songs; being ignorant of the fact that they were actually performed live, interspersed among acting scenes, I marveled at the commenters’ powers of inference.

When I saw Firebringer in my freshman fall at MIT—urged to attend by other people on my hall involved in the production—it lingered in my mind for days after. How was it possible for a group of college students to tell a story so vividly and intensely? It was about more than the acting, more than the singing, more than the dancing. I attended no shortage of plays and a cappella performances and dance showcases (and—bonus—the Boston Ballet). These were all good. I enjoyed them. But I was never once touched as deeply as I have been, consistently, by musical theater.

So what is it? Maybe it’s the writing, this undercurrent of dark humor that runs through most musicals I’ve seen. Lots of musicals have this structure where Act I is relatively normal and Act II flips the story on its head in a totally unexpected, fucked-up manner. But musicals with conventional story structures have made me cry, too.

Is it a sense of immersion? The lights, sound, and set design tend to be more elaborate for musicals than for concerts or dances. Maybe a musical puts more effort into crafting a specific experience for the audience. But that can’t be the only thing—seeing a movie in a theater is more immersive, and I’m rarely as touched by a movie as a musical.

What really makes musical theater my favorite medium is also its defining characteristic, the live performance of over-the-top musical numbers. Over-the-top is key: the entire medium is predicated on the idea that a character’s (or group of characters’) internal state of mind warrants a whole song and dance number. It elevates the character’s direct, internal experience of the world to an even higher level of importance than its subtler external manifestation as dialogue or body language. A production can’t shy away once it’s entered this stage: our inner worlds are so complex, so intensely and deeply felt, that to invert the character, to manifest their inside in the outer world, requires a commitment to fantasy. Yes, in this world everyone else knows the choreography by heart, everyone else knows the lyrics and joins in seamlessly and spontaneously, there’s even a live orchestra with an upright bass player—isn’t this how it happens in our heads, too?

It’s this brash inversion of self that I love, that runs so counter to conventions of social interaction. When my attempts at conversation are warped by a desire for relatability to the point of being unrecognizable, when the failure to be understood by other people makes me feel sick with disappointment—and when I say failure I don’t mean solely that we miss deep understanding but that we misunderstand even each other’s surface level meanings, that I’m unintentionally and unwillingly telling lies all the time in service of convenience and conformity—there are two reprieves I turn to.

First is to retreat inside my head and draw the curtains closed—by writing, mostly, a process during which I don’t think about other people at all. Though I often end up posting my writing online, and it’s a wonderful feeling when people comment on it and reveal they’ve given my work their attention for a few minutes, this joy is separate from the peace that the bare activity of writing brings me. Writing is a time to lean into my wildest inclinations with no regard for other people’s expectations. So success in writing, to me, means honesty—not in the sense that I’ve been factually accurate but in the sense that I’ve painted a world that reflects something that was really inside me.

And second is to consume art: to watch others flip themselves inside out. To release the mess they contain—to organize it in some way, of course, to present it as song or dance or another art, to reduce its unlimited dimensionality to a physically comprehensible form—putting in years of effort just for the hope that someone somewhere will view it and understand what they mean.

Through art the concept of a stranger transforms from an unknowable figure, an opponent in a game, to someone to open your heart to despite whatever anxiety you feel about a world in which you have no hope of bridging the gap between you and other people. That’s what making art is for me: not a statement of trust, exactly, but a statement of hope.

I wanted to try this, too—to open the curtains, to turn myself inside out on a stage. Maybe then I would feel understood.

After seeing Firebringer I had a brief stint of involvement with MIT’s Musical Theater Guild, which puts on all these productions. Lacking the confidence to audition, instead I designed some posters and ran the sound board for Into the Woods that spring.

Running sound is a nontrivial task especially for a show with as much interwoven dialogue as Into the Woods. I fucked up more than once. So although I loved the show, I was also nervous every night, afraid to let down all the other people on the cast and crew. Apprehensive about repeating the experience, I slunk away until this winter—three years later—when finally I signed up for an audition slot for Cabaret.

In the four weeks of IAP before Cabaret’s opening night, we learned the lines, choreo, and vocals in evening rehearsals scattered around rooms in the Stud. In the final week (“prod week”), we ran the show in full every night, progressively adding sound and lights and set and orchestra. Finally at the end of IAP we had the first weekend of real performances.

I thought acting would be like a more intense and active version of the audience experience. What I got was more intense and active, but along a different axis: getting closer to the workings of the show didn’t immediately make me feel more connected to the audience or to other actors on stage. It was difficult to channel the kind of energy I wanted when so much cognition was being spent on coarser movements—how to time my entry, the broad strokes of choreo, hitting the correct notes and words.

The gap between doing it right and doing it honestly manifested in all the details I had no energy or skill to spare for, like the fine control over facial expression, gesture, and tone that the lead actors refined over the course of prod week. Or the emotional continuity between scenes, being able to step out of the wings where you’ve been sitting watching other people dance around for 20 minutes and immediately enter the state of high emotional tension that your character left off in their last scene.

This gap between personal taste and realized quality of one’s work is present in any medium, of course. I was introduced to it by the Ira Glass quote:

Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.

I’m lucky that I started writing early enough that it became a comforting activity long before I cared about the taste-vs-skill gap. But I can’t say the same for musical theater. Maybe past some threshold of singing or acting skill, when you open your mouth you’re able to tap into a beautiful, fulfilling connection, to energize a wire which thrums with understanding between you and everyone else in the room. I’m very far from that.

Still, being a part of Cabaret was beautiful. Each night before the start of the show, we gathered in the dressing room to do our hair and makeup. Everyone was bursting with the desire to sing, all the time. Sometimes someone played Hozier or Lady Gaga on their speaker and we all joined in, one after the other—or the soft hum of a lyric from the show would morph into a full-fledged song—either way the dressing room blossomed with music every night, voices mingling, shoes squeaking in impromptu dance across the wooden floor.

In these moments, in the silent and shared agreement to sing together, to break into harmony and melody, lead and backing parts, I felt it: not a knife through my anxiety, which came in waves throughout the night regardless, but a reason to walk with it. A confirmation of hope.

After the run of Cabaret was over, I found myself listening to songs from musicals in my spare time. On shuffle, a song from Into the Woods that I had entirely forgotten about came up.

It feels like I’m alone when this fear arrives. Surrounded on all sides by a barrier totally excluding the possibility of touch. Even if your hand rests against mine, could I ever hope to know what you’re feeling? Listening to No One Is Alone now, touched through a three-year-thick blanket of time by my memories of the actor on stage choking out the lyrics between tears, something like regret washed over me. What if I had stayed after Into the Woods? Auditioned for the next musical when I felt like it? Would I now be able to connect with people the way I felt connected with when I watch musicals? Would I be less inhibited, more confident, more present?

During Cabaret I was torn over whether to audition for MTG again. But on the Tuesday after closing night, the first time in three weeks that I’d gone 48 hours without performing the show, I realized—despite my imperfect performances; despite the constant danger of disappointing others and myself; despite the workload—that I missed it. I missed getting the chance to make art with other people, even if at times it felt like I was failing. Because in the end we made something beautiful anyway, despite any mistakes, something that made the audience laugh and cry and reflect deeply on the world we had created.

My anxiety has receded since freshman year but still I sometimes find myself gripped by nausea, sweating and shivering, nerves screaming for anything but the current moment, cold shock through my heart at a glance into the dark future. But it doesn’t matter in the end. There’s only one choice to make when this fear creeps in, and it’s to hold on to hope or to give up. Yes, I’ve given up before, all those times I let anxiety deter me from going to the gym or psetting with people or asking a question. But I’ve also looked this fear in the eye and walked with it out the other side and found someone who loved my art—or someone whose art I loved. Someone whose voice felt as familiar as a friend’s. Someone whose performance of a scene let me know they understood everything.",,0

recently, most people i’ve talked to have been high-strung and uncertain. recently, it has been hard to see the good in the world. recently, it has been hard to remain hopeful.

i emailed him a few weeks ago in a particularly acute bout of despair, thinking of the wisdom he would share with us in class between raucous bursts of laughter.

These past few news cycles have made me think a lot about what it means to be and do good in spite of it all. Aside from holding Mary Oliver close to the heart, how might I navigate these troubled times when everything feels so fragile? Any nuggets of wisdom or poems (arguably the same thing) would be much appreciated.

a few days later, a new book of poems made it onto my bookshelf.



the foreword by ross gay was enough to dissolve me into tears. i did a report on ross gay’s poems once, in 21.487, and he actually came here to give a talk that i unfortunately missed because i was stuck in lab.

I have been spending a lot of time lately thinking about witness, about how witness itself is a kind of poetics, or poesis, which means making. […] Or maybe I have come to understand, to believe, how we witness makes our world. This is why attending to what we love, what we are astonished by, what flummoxes us with beauty, is such crucial work. Such rigorous work. […] Truth is, we are mostly too acquainted with the opposite, with the wreckage. It commands our attention, and for good reason. We have to survive it. But even if we need to understand the wreckage to survive it, it needn’t be the primary object of our study. The survival need be. […] The love need be. The care need be. […] How we need need be, too. Our radiant need. Our luminous and mycelial need. […] And that study, that practice, that witness, is called gratitude. Our gratitude need be.

as my time at MIT ticks closer and closer to an end (for real this time, for my MEng), i have come to appreciate more and more the little things about this place that i once took for granted, the things that i once was cynical and jaded about. it’s amazing how much the professors can care, and it’s amazing how much help and good will is available to you if you only ask. it’s amazing how much people look out for each other, and how much people care about each other, and that alone gives me the hope that i need.

i am constantly astonished by the goodness that persists in the world. in small moments, i see over and over again how people choose goodness, and it’s the consciousness of that choice that gets me all weepy and sentimental.

last week, i sent out a very small poll asking for some poems that spark hope. here is that list complete with snippets that ring true, along with some of my own favorites.

- Earthrise – Amanda Gorman [text] […] we hold nothing dearer than this floating body we all call home. We know it’s never too soon To choose hope.


- […] we hold nothing dearer than this floating body we all call home.

- We know it’s never too soon To choose hope.

- Wild Geese – Mary Oliver (of course) Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on. Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting over and over announcing your place in the family of things.

- Prompt 18: beautiful things – Nikita Gill […] everyone I love is doing beautiful things and trying to make life worth living,


- […] everyone I love is doing beautiful things and trying to make life worth living,

- Solstice Re-pot – Shailja Patel nothing is promised, sweet green girl I know the terror of unhoming dance this one with me

- Good Bones – Maggie Smith […] This place could be beautiful, right? You could make this place beautiful.

- Feast (triptych) – Beth H. Piatote But do we have better dreams? Have we seen better things? Still, there was every morning an optimistic sky.


- But do we have better dreams? Have we seen better things?

- Still, there was every morning an optimistic sky.

- Anthropocenic – Jake Skeets any shadow still means light

 in the laub lab studying bacterial immune systems and competing with the track and field team as a pole vaulter! i am also preparing for spokes 2025, a summer program where 8 mit students bike from washington, d.c. to san francisco, ca and do learning festivals for students in rural, underserved communities along the way!

to reminisce for a quick second, i remember reading the blog for the 1st time in ap chem the spring of my junior year of high school. i had just received an email from MIT’s pole vault coach about potentially looking into the program—wanting to study biology and pursue medicine, MIT NEVER struck me as a possible school.

“well, when a school like THAT emails you, you have to at least look into it, right?”

the first place i looked was the blog, and the rest was history. a HUGEE shoutout to angie for featuring me in a guest post so i can go full circle and share my own story! anyways, i’m here to talk about IAP! i used my first IAP to rest from 1st semester, explore boston, get ready to UROP, and train for track season! today, i’m going to focus on the track part.

week 1: return to campus, suffolk ice breaker @ new balance

after flying in on sunday, the team got right back to practice on wednesday. our 1st meet was that weekend, so we had no time to waste. i honestly can’t remember much from the days leading up to the meet…but some of the pole vaulters did make a minecraft server. the 1st meet was at the new balance track, which is a super fancy track facility across the bridge in boston. since i had never competed in a real college meet before, i honestly was just looking to have fun. i ended up jumping 8’ 8.25 (the conversion is weird since college track uses meters…not very american), which is a little under a foot under my high school PR, so not bad!

week 2: uri invitational and guys cook

this week’s competition was 2 hours away at the university of rhode island: before this, i had never been to rhode island, so that was pretty cool. it was also fun to go to a meet farther away and travel with the team: unfortunately though, because this was a “D1” meet (at least it was being hosted by a D1 team), the opening height was pretty high for me, and i “no-heighted” (did not clear a single bar). it was still fun to cheer on my fellow vaulters, though, and only gave me motivation for next week…

i didn’t get any pictures from one of the pole vault squad’s most fun annual traditions, “guys/girls cook” dinner (with this week being guys cook), but they made tacos. yum! i did, however, get pics of heavy snow that came down that night, and the snowman we made on killian court because of it.

week 3: media day!!! + riverhawk invitational @ new balance and girls cook

MEDIA DAY!!! i’ve literally been looking forward to this day for months. i think for this one i’m just going to let the pictures speak for themselves. the team was back at new balance later this weekend: i tagged along to both meets, but unfortunately i got a concussion earlier that week, so i couldn’t compete :( the team was looking good! on the way back to the bus, though, one of the pole bags was accidentally carried the wrong way, or the cap wasn’t taped on good enough, or something like that, because the whole bag of poles spilled down the stairs…rip. the next day was girls cook! we made pasta with vodka sauce and italian sausage, garlic bread, cesar salad, and i made some banana bread, too. 10/10.

week 4: harvard invite

last meet of IAP :(( like last week, this was a split gender meet, so guys went on friday, with girls on saturday. after the men competed, the squad went to el jefe’s in harvard square for some bomb mexican food. saturday competition was GREAT: i finally cleared 9’ for the 1st time in college, but after that i had to get on larger poles that i had ever been on before (there are a number of reasons for this, but in short it’s good if you are getting on bigger/longer poles). i had to go up in length (12’ to 13’), and different length poles bend differently and…yeah i didn’t clear anymore bars, but i was happy that i was performing so well that i had to get out bigger poles, so yay! for fun, i’ve included some other fun pics from the week, too.

and that was part of my IAP! i’ve already talked a lot so i’m going to hand the microphone (i mean the blog) back to angie: THANK YOU AGAIN ANGIE!!!

——————————————————————————————————————

YAY THANK YOU SARAH! next up is…

Christine O. (’28)

christine and i met during interphase (which i have a whole other post about), here’s her and another one of our interphase friends indulging in some fine literature

Over IAP I took a lot of different classes. I mainly participated in Momentum and Web Lab, which are some of many IAP classes in which students work on a project they later showcase in a final competition.

Every year, Momentum students work with a different partner organization and divide into teams to tackle different facets of a real-world issue. This year, our partner was MIT’s Lincoln Lab (which we were able to tour during the first week of the class) and our challenge was wildfires. My team’s contribution was basically just a system of sensors that would be brought out into the field to monitor factors like humidity levels, temperature, and volatile organic compounds concentration that could put areas at a higher risk for wildfires; in the event that something looked off, they’d send a signal to whoever was monitoring the area.

As for Web Lab, it aims to teach the fundamentals of web development to students across all class years. Students form teams and use what they’ve learned in class to build their own website based on the year’s theme (this year’s was “Branching Out”), and the class culminates in a competition in which participating teams can win up to $5,000! I spent a lot of IAP working on my website.

We had lectures for the first two weeks of Momentum and Web Lab. I also sat in on lectures for BattleCode, another competition-based CS class in which teams write code for an autonomous player in a real-time strategy game. I decided not to compete this year, but it was really interesting seeing what was going on over there. Additionally, all three of those classes had a lot of guest speakers: one of the ones from BattleCode was a partner at Y Combinator, which was really cool. I also sat in on 
        algorithms
      
 and some 
        SIPB
      
 mini-lectures: I went to a “Building with AI” one and that was pretty cool: I got to build a project using Windsurf for the first time.

Finally, I took a quantum computing course! I lowkey did not understand what was going on because it had a lot of linear algebra, which I haven’t taken yet, but the parts that I did understand were really cool and inspired me to look into quantum computing a little more. Now, I think it’s something that I might want to pursue later with my degree. I’m also going to participate in iQuHack, MIT’s quantum computing hackathon.

I played in the snow a lot, which is really nice because I am from Texas so obviously it doesn’t really snow that often. I got to play in the snow with 
        my favorite, Angie Fortnite
      
; build a lot of snowmen; and ice skate! I also went sledding down a hill in Alewife. It was really fun, but I completely tumbled over myself and hit my head.

Outside of campus, I went to the Museum of Fine Arts which was also pretty fun. My favorite part is the jewelry section. And I went to Matcha Café, which is probably my favorite matcha place ever

I was not on a meal plan at all and I also wasn’t really going out and buying food, so I was 
        mostly eating in my classes
      
 but luckily, I live in Juniper and the girls there are so sweet and good at cooking, so I got to eat a lot of really nice food. Also, my dad sent me a case of new teas around the same time one of my friends brought some tea from China, so we had a cute little tea party with that!

Finally, I also got back to my science olympiad roots! I did science olympiad in high school, and this IAP I got to volunteer at the MIT Science Olympiad. Being on the other side of all the events was a really nice experience. I’m also volunteering at the Harvard venture capital conference which is pretty interesting because I don’t really know anything about VC yet.

So yeah, I think that was my whole IAP! Pretty busy, but I had a lot of fun.

——————————————————————————————————————

thank you Christine :)! as for me, IAP was prime time for hard resetting my brain after a semester of a routine that, while far more exciting than all the ones i’d previously held, was a routine nonetheless. i think MIT is, like any other place, what you make of it. so, when work piles up, i always make a conscious effort to see the place i spent so much of high school dreaming about past the repetition and mountain of psets; the days where i do this successfully are often just as good as, if not better than, the ones i spend on instantly satisfying activities where i don’t have to think too hard to feel grateful. but i’m far from perfect, and the change of pace IAP brought made me aware of so many little things about myself, bad habits i’d carried over from high school and destructive patterns i’d constantly fall into, that slipped through the cracks during the hours and days of fall semester i spent just going through the motions. some of my goals from IAP went unaccomplished, and lots of my most meticulous plans ended up falling completely flat. but i grew and learned about myself in ways that i now see had gone ignored for way too long.

largely thanks to everything i took away from IAP, spring semester is pretty great. i don’t have many words to describe how it feels to live surrounded by friends, to spend my days learning about whatever i want, to be overwhelmed by opportunities to make a real impact on the world around me everywhere i step. even on my worst days, i feel a little tug on my heart when i walk past a snow angel on Kresge or see the overflowing bulletin boards in the infinite or catch peeks of the river from my window that reminds me that there’s still no place i’d rather be than here. and the days that follow these dark periods are usually extra bright to compensate: it always reminds me of when, on my third day of what had previously been an extremely cloudy and gray 
        CPW
      
, i walked out of my host’s building only to be bathed in sunlight, my first of many brushes with Boston’s funny way of saying sorry.

i’m grateful for MIT, and i’m grateful for everyone who chooses to share this experience with me through this blog. i’ll leave you all with some pictures from my IAP :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_6706-400x234.jpg

sticker stories,Kanokwan T. '26,6,2025-02-24T00:00:00-05:00,"One year ago, I lost my first stickered bottle. 😔

Pretty sure it slipped out of my backpack on the plane…silly me. I checked my location tracker (because I am crazy and put a really old tile on it) and saw it was still in the luggage area, submitted item retrieval paperwork to the airport, and have since heard nothing. Legend has it, the bottle is still there. Unfortunately, I have no intentionally-taken photos of it, but I did manage to find the bottle in the corners of old photos! Pardon the grain.

Here are the cropped versions:

 

(very short eulogy): you did such a great job at holding water. oh great green bottle, you will be missed.

I feel like a mosaic, comprised of fragments of everything around me.

My water bottles have been akin to that, but instead with stickers.

Fun fact: 2 years ago, while I was working as an Orientation Leader, I was mistaken as ~the blogger who blogged about their water bottle stickers~ (which was actually Audrey C. ’24, at the time) because I had my bottle out. So, here is me adding to the blogger bottle lore.

I’ve made it a point to never buy a sticker for my bottles. I just use the ones that have naturally found their way into my life. Feels interestingly organic that way.

I also put stickers only on my bottle. I used to cover other things, like fridges or laptops, but I like them all in one place.

Layers and layers have built up. I like how the less-relevant stickers fade away under the new ones, but I know they’re still there. It’s also an interesting creative challenge to decide what stickers I’m willing to cover up for the sake of the newer ones.

I got a 
        new bottle.
      
 This time, with an 
        AirTag instead,
      
 for more accurate tracking.

That’s all! More stickers to come…","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2320-800x1423.jpg

"What Is This, a Crossover Episode?",Andi Q. '25,6,2025-02-23T00:00:00-05:00,"During the first MIT Wind Ensemble (MITWE) rehearsal this semester, Fred Harris (the director of MITWE) was going through the semester’s important dates and logistics. It was all the typical stuff – CPW concert in April, no rehearsal on Presidents’ Day, etc. – until suddenly:

“There will also be no rehearsal on Wednesday, February 19. There will be a… special surprise… for us that day. I will say nothing more.”

I was very excited to hear this. Two years ago, Fred had also promised a “special surprise” that turned out to be a free week-long trip to the Amazon Rainforest over spring break. We got to perform in a bright pink opera house in the middle of the rainforest! But I was also a little suspicious. The most recent “special surprise” was a few days before classes started, when Fred informed the MITWE clarinets that we were scheduled to perform in the Sonic Jubilance concert in the second week of the semester. You never quite know what you’re getting into with Fred.

(In case you were wondering, the concert went great. Jeremy wrote a blog post about it yesterday that you should read.)

A week later, I received an email from the Music & Theater Arts (MTA) events office revealing the surprise. Jacob Collier (!) and Yo-Yo Ma (!!) were coming to MIT (!!!) to tape the pilot episode of some video-podcast-like series, and as an MTA student, I was invited to attend (!!!!). Talk about a crossover episode! It was very much the first kind of “special surprise” I was hoping for.

For context, Jacob Collier and Yo-Yo Ma are two incredibly talented, world-famous musicians:

- Jacob is a vocalist/songwriter/producer/
        multi-instrumentalist
      
/educator known for basically being a modern-day Mozart. That is to say, he’s an eccentric performer and a savant at everything music theory – even the complicated stuff like jazz. He has won 7 Grammys at just 30 years old and has almost 2 million subscribers on YouTube and TikTok.

- Yo-Yo is one of, if not the most well-known cellists ever. Ask anyone to name a cellist and they’ll probably name him. He has won 19 Grammys, and if you listen to classical music on the radio or Spotify, you’ve almost certainly heard his music. He even appeared on an episode of Arthur once, and if that’s not the peak of fame, I don’t know what is.


  
          
        
      
          
        
      
      
      This was an actual episode that happened.
  

This was an actual episode that happened.

Now, I know what you’re probably thinking. If these two musicians are so amazing and famous, what are they doing at MIT – a science and engineering school? Well firstly, MIT has a top-tier music program, thank you very much. But secondly, Jacob and Yo-Yo have surprisingly deep affiliations, both personal and professional, with MIT:

- Jacob did his first-ever college artist residency at MIT in 2016, back when he was first going viral online. Fred was the person who led the effort for him to come to MIT! The residency ended in a massive concert with Jacob performing with over 150 MIT music students in Kresge Auditorium. MIT Video Productions made a documentary about that concert, 
        which went on to win an Emmy
      
. Before that residency, he had also worked closely with Ben Bloomberg, a PhD student at MIT’s Media Lab, to design equipment for his live performances.

- Yo-Yo lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And hey – that’s also where MIT lives! He has collaborated plenty of times with MIT MTA over the past few decades and is friends with several MIT professors. Not just the music professors, I must add – one time when LSC (MIT’s student-run cinema) was planning a special event sponsored by Professor Anantha Chandrakasan (dean of the school of engineering), 
        he casually suggested inviting “[his] good friend Yo-Yo Ma” as the moderator for the Q&A at the end
      
.

Admittedly, I wasn’t as big a Jacob Collier/Yo-Yo Ma fan as many of the other MIT students in attendance. I don’t listen to much cello music (I much prefer piano/clarinet music), and a lot of Jacob’s music is just a bit too avant-garde for me. Still, the taping was pretty incredible, and I am listening to a Yo-Yo Ma album on repeat as I write this post.

Unfortunately, we were strictly forbidden from filming or taking pictures during the taping, so I don’t have any pretty pictures or videos to show you. BUT! The production company did not (explicitly) ban pen and paper, so I sneakily wrote down notes the whole time.

There is definitely much to be desired in the quality of my notes, but in any case, here is my best approximation of what happened that evening:



(From here onward, I will omit the audience for clarity and also my own image editing sanity.)

 





In many of his performances, Jacob uses audience participation (usually through singing) as a tool to create music.





Then more opening remarks. Yo-Yo finally enters the concert hall after a brief introduction from Jacob. TL;DR: This event was meant to be a conversation between Jacob and Yo-Yo with audience participation sprinkled in between.



The fanboying back and forth went on for a solid five minutes.



I’m not joking, he actually said this pretty much verbatim.



The audience then spontaneously started whistling to imitate birds. It sounded like this but with people singing in the background and Jacob improvising fluttery chords on the piano. It felt rehearsed but wasn’t. (Fun fact: I never learned how to whistle before coming to MIT.)





Jacob and Yo-Yo were both child prodigies but were raised very differently. Suzie Collier, Jacob’s mother, always encouraged him to “be Jacob when [he] was a wee lad”. (He says “when I was wee lad” a lot because he’s British.)



(A four-octave vocal range is insane, by the way. Most people only have a three-octave range.)

They played the following two songs from Hush:

- Flight of the Bumblebee (that really fast song that you’d see videos of child prodigies playing on YouTube). “Wow, we went from the birds to the bees,” Yo-Yo joked after this performance.

- Stars (a song with 13 beats per measure, which is really unusual for most people but apparently completely normal for Jacob). Jacob started beatboxing in the middle of this one, which Bobby McFerrin did not do in the original album.

At this point, Yo-Yo decided to really lean into the “haha I am so old” part of his personality for some reason. He talked about how he met Bobby at Leonard Bernstein’s 70th birthday party (which was almost 40 years ago), before telling Jacob that he doesn’t know how the screen-record feature on iPhones works.





The audience member whose phone started ringing then hurriedly left out of embarrassment. Jacob wasn’t mocking them or anything though – you could tell he was totally prepared to start jamming out to the ringtone.



For a moment, I tuned out the conversation as I scribbled down notes on my paper. When I stopped writing, however, I was greeted by this new conversation:



Not sure what exactly led them here, but cool I guess.



A somewhat serious conversation ensued after this. Stuff about how rules are worth making so you can bend/break them (both in life and music). But then suddenly:







They played Gershwin’s Summertime for this jam session, with the audience choir singing chords in the background while Yo-Yo played the melody on his cello. Summertime is already a beautiful song by itself, so this was my highlight of the evening.

(Kind of ironic though, given how cold it was outside.)

At this point, we only had about ten minutes left, so there was some audience Q&A before the final jam session.

- Q: How can one overcome the barrier to entry for stuff like orchestral music?

- Yo-Yo: “Find someone who likes something and ask them to show you why they like it.”

- Q: What are you dreaming of that isn’t quite possible right now?

- Jacob: “A space for holding all the stuff we have in the world, and a space where we can all coexist and collaborate.”

- Q: Have you ever had some big idea where you don’t have the tools to execute it?

- Jacob: “Yeah, almost every project.” “… Life would be boring if everything was easy and possible.”



We ended the evening with the Dona Nobis Pacem canon – traditionally a short prayer for peace that ends a church service. What a fitting way to end an incredible evening!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tumblr_inline_p9c5ckqjTj1qf25e0_500-400x291.jpg

SONIC JUBILANCE,Jeremy W.,3,2025-02-22T00:00:00-05:00,"Banjos & Basements: A Brief History of Music at MIT

Music has been part of MIT since the Institute’s earliest chapters. By 1884, 23 years after MIT was founded, the Banjo Club and the Glee Club had been officially launched. The October 22, 1884 issue of The Tech confirmed that, “An instrumental orchestra, consisting of first and second violins, violas, ‘cellos, flutes, first and second cornets, clarinet, trombone and double bass,” was in the process of forming, as well. On November 19, 1884, The Tech reported the first “official” musical space on the MIT campus (then located in Boston’s Back Bay):

The Glee Club and Orchestra are so fortunate as to have secured a room in the Institute for holding their rehearsals this year. The room in the basement of the new building, occupied by the architects as a studio for water-color sketching and life class, and as a recitation-room, is to be heated and lighted, and, through the kindness of President Walker, the musical societies will be permitted to place a piano there, and at certain hours to hold rehearsals. The great advantages of having a room in the Institute itself are apparent, and these, together with the fact of the far greater interest felt by the students this year than that which was shown last, give a bright prospect of success.

The great advantages of having a room in the Institute itself are apparent, and these, together with the fact of the far greater interest felt by the students this year than that which was shown last, give a bright prospect of success.

Unfortunately, a year later the orchestra was disbanded due to lack of support, and for the next several decades—which marked MIT’s move from Boston to Cambridge—the MIT orchestra disbanded and reformed several times.

It wasn’t until 1947 with the transformational arrival of conductor Klaus Liepmann, MIT’s first first ever full-time music professor, that the foundation of MIT’s music program would begin to form. For the next quarter-century, Liepmann would put in motion a thriving music program at MIT, supported by funding from the Institute, that built the foundation for the world-class, conservatory-quality music program we have today.

On May 23, 1947, the revitalized MIT Symphony orchestra put on a spring concert. As reported by The Tech:

The M.I.T. Symhony orchestra will be heard for the first time under its new conductor Mr. Klaus Liepmann…The orchestra been enlarged since its last concert and this program represents an ambitious undertaking for a college orchestra. The success of this concert will have much to do with formulating future plans.

Symhony orchestra will be heard for the first time under its new conductor Mr. Klaus Liepmann…The orchestra been enlarged since its last concert and this program represents an ambitious undertaking for a college orchestra. The success of this concert will have much to do with formulating future plans.

Ambitious, indeed. The program included Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1 (featuring Arnold Judson ’47 as the soloist), Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, Mozart’s Symphony No. 35, and Strauss’s Kaiser-Walzer, Op. 437 (Emperor Waltz). 

The orchestra performed in the auditorium of Rindge Technical High School in Cambridge (today known as Cambridge Rindge and Latin School). Six years later, MIT would break ground on Kresge Auditorium, the 1,200-seat performance hall and “meetinghouse of MIT.”

Music at MIT Today

Fast-forward to 2025: the opening of the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building, the first facility on the MIT campus dedicated solely to music! Today, more than 1,500 MIT students take music classes each year, and hundreds of student musicians participate in one of MIT’s 30 performance ensembles—but until now, there has never been a centralized facility at MIT for music instruction, experimentation, and rehearsal.

More than 140 years since the Institute’s first orchestra gathered in the basement of a building in Boston’s Back Bay (and nearly 80 years since welcoming our first professor of music) we finally have a dedicated home to consolidate the rich variety of musical activities that take place at MIT. A cause for celebration!

To mark the historic opening of the Linde Music Building—and to kick off Artfinity: The MIT Festival of the Arts—MIT presented SONIC JUBILANCE, a performance featuring a range of vocal and instrumental ensembles spanning jazz, classical, and traditional music of Senegal and Bali. Set in the acoustically-immaculate Thomas Tull Concert Hall, the concert featured world premieres of four remarkable new pieces: John Harbison’s Two Noble Kinsmen, Charles Shadle’s Grace, Miguel Zenón’s Summit, and Keeril Makan’s Madrigal.

Music Building Open House

In the afternoon leading up to the much-anticipated SONIC JUBILANCE concert, the Linde Building opened its doors to the public for an open house, with performances by jazz and chamber ensembles and interactive workshops for Balinese Gamelan (led by Gusti Komin) and Senegalese drumming (led by Lamine Touré). I arrived at the Linde building at 1:30 PM, exploring the lobby that conjoins the facility’s three halls.

Even though I was early, I still wasn’t able to get a seat to the standing-room-only jazz performance held in the Jae S. and Kyuho Lim Music Maker Pavilion. Standing in the back didn’t detract from the experience at all; with the remarkable acoustics in the space I could hear every detail of each performer with striking clarity.

After the first piece in the jazz set, I snuck out to explore the Beatrice and Stephen Erdely Music and Culture Space. After first taking off my shoes (as instructed by the sign at the entrance) I slide into the hall to find Lamine Touré leading a West African drum workshop in the style of his renowned ensemble, Rambax MIT. I enjoyed the energizing sounds of the sabar drum beats for a few minutes before hopping across the lobby to the Thomas Tull Concert Hall to check in on the MIT Laptop Ensemble (FaMLE) soundcheck.

As a musician and sound nerd myself, I often enjoy soundchecks and rehearsals more than the performances themselves—so I was excited for the opportunity to observe FaMLE set up their rig in the new hall outfitted with an insane set of speakers. Here’s a quick compilation of some of the footage I grabbed while FaMLE ran their soundcheck.

During the FaMLE performance, director Ian Hattwick and his students experimented live using a few methods of digital music performance: generating music through code, looping music samples created live on pads and keyboards, and collaborating in real-time to produce lush sonic scapes that took full advantage of the surround-sound setup. Honestly, I could have gone home after this performance and been more than satisfied with the day.

SONIC JUBILANCE

My musical cup was already full just from the open house performances and workshops in the afternoon…but this was just the beginning. There were several more hours of music to enjoy later that evening at the main concert event.

Around 7 PM, my colleague Trinidad and I arrived back at the Linde Building just as a winter storm began to blanket Cambridge in snow. After we snagged great seats in the second row (behind all the Music and Theater Arts faculty!), I took a few minutes to explore the upper level of the hall.

What unfolded for the next two hours was an overwhelming display of creativity and talent— and thankfully, you can enjoy a recording of the concert on both MIT’s Facebook page and the MIT Music and Theater Arts website.

I did manage to capture a few moments on video, which I’ll share below. These clips include the world premiere of Summit by Grammy Award-winning, MacArthur Genius Miguel Zenón (timestamp 1:14:40 on the concert livestream), beautiful shadows cast by the MIT Wind Ensemble Flutes (timestamp 1:59:50), and the world premiere of Keeril Makan’s Madrigal, featuring violinist Natalie Lin-Douglas (timestamp 2:16:50). Madrigal was a clear highlight of the evening for me.

To introduce Madrigal before its world premiere, Keeril offered some remarks about the inspiration behind the piece:

As part of any MIT capital project there is a commission for a new piece of art, and Joyce [Linde] was part of that selection committee that chose Sanford Biggers to create the sculpture Madrigal that you greet, that greets you at the front of the building. A madrigal is Renaissance composition—multi-voiced—which inspired Sanford in his work to create something that is multifaceted. No matter what angle you look at the work, you see something new, and your own perspective is prioritized over any one point of view. I found this inspiring for my piece, which you’ll hear now…

The piece features Natalie Lin-Douglas as the solo violinist in the center of the stage, with several student musicians perched around the upper-level of the hall. Natalie is lit dramatically on four sides, casting a prismatic display of shadows around her, while the supporting musicians glow softly in the rafters above. As the soloist produces a succession of stark, percussive bursts and romantic lamentations, the musicians above repeat the same motifs, creating a disorienting surround-sound effect. Like the sculpture that inspired the piece, Madrigal has no clear static focal point, visually or aurally. Instead, a swirl of sound and light places each listener at their own sensory anchor point.

To me, Madrigal is the perfect metaphor for music at MIT: multi-voiced, always changing, and unique to every listener. And if history is any guide, music will continue to be a fundamental part of MIT in the chapters that lie ahead.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Jazz-800x1067.jpeg

Fall 2024 🍂,Fiona L. '27,1,2025-02-21T00:00:00-05:00,"Classes

(12 units) 6.200 [Circuits] – I LOVE this class. Adam Hartz should legally adopt me. /hj I thought circuit theory was the 
        coolest thing ever
      
, and I thought the weekly labs were even cooler than that. Every week, I’d mentally dread the labs, given that they were on a Friday afternoon, but I’d always come out of it with a cool device, feeling a sense that I’d really learned a lot in those three hours. My favorite thing I build has to be the light sensing robot, a robot created using light sensors and wheels that scurries away from light. I named my robot Adam Hartz, and Adam personally came to look at my robot 😳😳😳.

(12 units) 6.191 [Computation Structures] – Amazing and intriguing content, but the lectures didn’t work that well with my learning style. I found it really cool to program in a hardware language, even though we didn’t get to work with hardware :( I appreciated the grading scheme for the class—fixed grade cutoffs with 20 “extra” points possible from a design project. Unlike some other classes, which were 
        “”technically””
      
 “graded on a curve”, there was no such thing in 6.191.

(12 units) 18.600 [Probability and Random Variables] – I was peer pressured into this by Jay B ’27. Although I didn’t get the chance to take this class with Professor Sheffield 
, I still really enjoyed the content. The first third of the course was probability, which compared to the latter two thirds of the course, random variables, felt deceptively easy. Although I enjoyed the probability section better, I still liked learning about different kinds of distributions and ways to think about chance as a function.

(12 units) 21W.774 [The Art of Comic Book Writing] – I LOVED writing and drawing comics, although I definitely could’ve appreciated more grade transparency in this class. As an extra credit project for this class, I attended a panel where I got to meet the author of one of our assigned comic readings, and I bought a signed copy from him! I really liked each week’s readings, and I felt like I grew a lot from each writing assignment.

an assignment for 21W.744

(3 units) 8.A22 [Black Holes, the Accelerating Universe, the Disordered Cosmos] – This is an advising seminar I participated in as an associate advisor! I learned that despite how incredibly cool “astrophysics” sounded to me and how much I loved Physics 1 / Mechanics, astrophysics might not be that fun. But was made this class worth it was the discussions, and how Prof. Ed used its two readings (Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time” and Chandra Prescod-Winestein’s “The Disordered Cosmos”) to defty weave together a dialogue about physics and social justice.

(6 units, dropped) 16.632 [Intro to Autonomous Machines] – For some reason, this class didn’t jibe with me like 6.200 did. Although I appreciated the chance to build, I personally didn’t like the pace of the class, and preferred a class that went into both theory and hardware, like 6.200 did. I originally chose this class because I wanted to be in 
        NEET
      
, and had a mini internal crisis during the middle of the semester where I struggled to decide whether or not to stay in NEET.

Extracurriculars / On Campus Jobs

Paid Notetaker – A paid notetaker position was offered for both 6.191 and 6.200. I took both of these positions, thinking to myself “I’m going to come to class anyways, so why not get paid for it.” Paid notetaking is a pretty good opportunity when it gets offered, and it’s typically more likely to be offered for larger classes like 191 and 200, since the notes you take get sent (anonymously) to a student with a DAS (Disability and Access Services) request.

Blogging – My first semester of blogging! I was so excited about this, given that I didn’t apply to the blogs as an incoming freshman because “I’d never get in!” and then proceeded to spend my entire freshman year daydreaming about being a blogger and idolizing all the bloggers and mentally planning out everything I’d blog about if I were a blogger. I loved attending blogger meeting every other Wednesday and getting to know all the other creative, quirky, and deeply caring souls of the blogger page :) (and Petey et al. I guess) I felt like I wanted to blog about every little thing that happened to me, but what actually happened was that the busyness of the semester made


        ESP
      
 – I wasn’t as involved with ESP this semester, since Splash, the program that I was directing, was postponed to Spring semester. However, I still stopped by a week of Cascade (ESP’s Spring Program) and came to meetings.


        Amphibious Achievement
      
 – I was also peer pressured into this by Jay B ’27. I had a really good time with this club—I spent Sunday mornings as an “academic mentor” (Amphibious Achievement offered the opportunity to be an academic and/or athletic mentor), going through lessons with kids, and helping them on whatever school work they had that week. Me and my mentee were both in a sticker-making workshop, where we learned concepts in graphic design, marketing, and ordering custom products. Working with the kids every week was a delight I could count on every weekend, and I loved learning more about their lives and interests. When we were short on mentors, I sometimes worked with Jay’s mentee—I learned more about his interest in guitar, and recommended him 
        uBlock origin
      
, which he said removed “99% of his ads.”

Along the way, I checked out some other extracurriculars, such as attending some meetings of Arcturus, a build team, and trying out for a dance team, although I never ended up sticking with them.

Outside of School

-many organizations sent rejection letters into my inbox. :(

-I feel like I did less “cool things” in my free time than in other semesters? It’s very very hard to find the time for it though :( I did spend time decorating my room though!

Lessons Learned

-most people don’t maintain a 5.0 forever, and the amount of people with one decreases every semester

-STUDY STUDY STUDY for tests. always.

– 
        doing homework in advance
      
 is a very good thing

-tell people you’re going to be late if you are (maybe this is just for me, given my tendency to be chronically late to everything)

-never let the desire to get good grades block out your love of learning. viewing my classes through the lens of “learning” was the most surefire way to shift my attitude from “i must persevere this challenge” to “i want to learn this new cool thing.”

-a good sleep schedule is the cornerstone of everything, whether it be a good mood, focus/attention span, health, not feeling like your life is out of control, and not feeling horrible all the time.

-a good recitation leader can make a big difference

Good Memories

-This year, I seemed to find new friendships in the most surprising places, whether it be 6.200 lab hours or 4am in a lounge. Although I feel like upperclassmen aren’t as desperate for friends as freshmen are, I feel like that’s a good thing, in a sense? That way, I let myself get to know people I really resonated with.

-Going on a duck tour with my advising group!

-Taking my RPM kids to Franklin Park Zoo’s light show! It was hard to make happen, especially since the program would not cover an Uber to the zoo. We had to take public transit there, and I was afraid of getting the route wrong. The lights were really beautiful! I was really happy, since I feel like I was able to exceed the freshmens’ expectations of the event.

-MY MOM CAME OVER FOR FAMILY WEEKEND!!! AND SHE ATE THE STIR FRY I MADE!!! AND SAID IT WAS GOOD!!!

-Taking people to visit my pink and cute room :)

-People enjoying my pink and cute room :)

-Saw SIX the musical!!!

-Attended PP Phormal and BC Formal. PP Formal was in an F1 Arcade. I tried racing and came in second to last place. :’(

-Seeing quaint New England towns [Kennebunksport, Ogunquit, Portsmouth] decked out for Christmas! Along the way, my friends and I also saw a giant gingerbread house in the lobby of Wentworth by the Sea.

-I tried a bunch of new food places, from Fire + Ice (a hibachi place in Boston) to Ripple Cafe (right next to campus) to Pho Basil to Shabu Zen Hotpot (and more!!!!)

-Becoming a Friend of the Ohms, visiting the Ohms’ performance at UMass along with Jay B ’27, and trying to decide which famline to be incorporated into.

Bad Memories

-Eating at Al’s French Fry

-Breaking my old phone 😭 


-Not succeeding in converting people to 21W at a SHASS event :(

-The time I saw a 
        RAT
      
 in my room and I had to call Unit 12 to get rid of it and some lady with 
        rat traps
      
 came and we spent a bunch of time banging everything in the room together at 
        3am
      
. The woman was really nice, although the horror of finding a rat in my room places this firmly in “bad memories.” After banging everything a bunch of times, we figured that the rat must have already left. At that very moment, the rat scurried out of my room.

Memories which Exist outside of the binary classification of “Best” and “Worst”

-During the 6.200 final exam, I took a makeup exam with 2 other people. I was terrified to find that there was a packet with REAL CIRCUIT COMPONENTS on our desks. I was pretty psyched out going into the exam, although I got the circuit to work in the end!
 Afterwards, I walked out of the room and into a winter wonderland—apparently, the first day of real snow was the last day of finals season. I spent the entire day coping from my finals while simultaneously being enamored with the snow in a way only a Californian could be.

-Sneaking into Next Dining in order to obtain milk for mango lassi.

-Going to Vermont with some of my friends to see the Ben and Jerry Ice Cream factory. There was a sign at the end that promised free samples of broccoli cheddar ice cream. That turned out to be just a prank :(((((( Which made me sad because I was really really interested in seeing what broccoli cheddar ice cream tasted like. The leaves in Vermont were all dead because we had ventured into Upper New England too late, but it was undoubtedly a bonding experience. The whole time, we were racing against the clock because two people on the trip (me included) had a Next Haunt run that very night at 10pm.

-Meeting the most brainrotted individuals at UPenn AND Brown. I went to Philadelphia during Indigenous Peoples’ Day Weekend and was welcomed into a living group that put pictures of wolves on their doors. There was a picture on the wall of the suite that we referred to as “The Sigma.” Four days couldn’t have felt shorter as we explored Philadelphia, did laundry, had a picnic, and played “Red Flags”, a card game where players attach ridiculous “red flags” onto fictional partners together. There was also a UPenn shower curtain there. (In the future I aim to meet the most brainrotted individuals from EVERY school, just for the memes.)

-The phrase “skull emoji” being the most commonly used phrase between me and my friends.

-Getting addicted to Vester Cafe, due to 
        their marketing techniques which I was very susceptible to
      
, their insanely good strawberry matcha, and the fact that certain people I knew were always there!

Feels


This semester seemed a lot more stable than the semesters before. I had started off the year already mentally used to college life and living in a dorm and the intensity of social life in college, so it wasn’t completely overwhelming like in freshman year. I had learned how much commitment was “too much,” so I wasn’t completely overwhelmed all the time.

When I look back to this semester, I think about a car driving down a road peppered with leaves. Maybe the same car that I was in when I saw the Ohms perform at UMass Amherst. Sometimes the road was bumpy, and the speed limits rose and fell as the road thinned, twisted, became slick with ice. But there was always solid ground to drive on, always the lines in the road for me to follow. I had all the “mental framework” of college that I had developed in the past year of floundering around and feeling overwhelmed. Things have calmed down, and I’m really glad for that.

small changes feeling big,Kanokwan T. '26,2,2025-02-17T00:00:00-05:00,"Every IAP, I travel.

I can’t help it. There’s this wanderlust gremlin in me that’s always eager to experience new places. Access to global experiences is one of the reasons I chose this MIT, especially because I didn’t have access to them growing up. I dreamt of seeing worlds beyond my own.

So, I must confess: before this trip, I didn’t know much about Armenia. But, that’s largely why I chose it. There was an allure: what was this place really like?

I was there to teach a renewable energy course at TUMO with my friend Caitlin O. ’25. We taught students how to CAD, circuit-build, and code—culminating in a solar-powered night light. The project was very cute and a good means to pick up skills. The experience was fun for what it was, though an unexpected hurdle came up. Caitlin, unfortunately, fell very ill the 2nd day, so I had to learn some of her material and teach 9 out of the 10 days mostly on my own. (don’t worry, she’s doing much better now) Thankfully, TUMO pairs teachers from abroad with teaching assistants/translators, which was especially helpful since many students didn’t speak English and I had to teach solo on the fly. Despite the challenges, the students’ enthusiasm made the experience all the more rewarding. I found myself always bouncing around the classroom answering questions from eager kids. And their final projects were mad cool.

I lived in the capital city: Yerevan. Our teaching program also covered a day trip out to rural 
        Dilijan.
      
 A solid mix of fast and slow places. Here are some pictures…

I loved finding something new every day.

The cultural differences appeared not in dramatic ways but, instead, subtleties. The city was lined with rose-colored tiles, echoing the beauty of its flower gardens. Armenian was the dominant language, followed by Russian, with English a distant third. A circular park anchored the city’s center, gently curving the roads around it. Cars zipped through the streets like mad, while sidewalks dipped into underground markets.

Seeing both the city and the rural was sweet; I saw the country more as a whole. Pretty mountains, deep history, and wonderfully curious people.

How I got recruited to play D3 soccer at MIT,Emiko P. '25,3,2025-02-16T00:00:00-05:00,"The college recruiting process can be a confusing world to maneuver for athletes and their families. The soccer recruiting process, while definitely intimidating and tiring at times, ended up being a great decision for me, as I spent all four years of college playing D3 soccer on MIT’s Women’s Soccer team! I was the first in my family of four kids (who all play soccer) to get recruited, so I definitely have advice for other student-athletes interested in MIT or in playing college soccer in general.

I’m a senior in college now, meaning I did my recruiting process between 2018 and 2021, so keep in mind that some of my experience may be outdated. This is how I went about the college recruiting process for soccer, and how I eventually committed to MIT. I’m not entirely sure how other sports get recruited at MIT (or at other schools, for that matter), but hopefully some of the overall principles and advice can still apply!

My Recruiting Timeline at MIT

- I went to several D1 and D3 camps starting at the end of 
        sophomore year of high school.
      
I knew from the very beginning that I wanted a top-notch academic school.

- I went to an 
        ID camp
      
 at Harvard, which MIT was also attending. My mom checked out MIT’s campus while I was busy playing soccer, and she immediately told me that I should give it a chance (I was surprised to learn that MIT wasn’t solely devoted to STEM, which made my humanities heart glow). My interest in MIT had been piqued. 

- I went to another camp in Florida in February of 2020 (literally one month before COVID shut everything down) and got to really talk with the MIT coach a lot, which made my connection to MIT feel stronger.

- I kept in touch with MIT – updating the coach on my SAT/ ACT scores, letting him know how my club games were going, and telling him the classes I was taking and the grades I was getting.

- I applied Early Action senior fall, and I was lucky enough to get in!!

- I officially committed the spring of my senior year of high school after carefully making sure MIT was the right place for me. Five months later, I was on campus stepping onto Roberts Field for the first of what would be thousands of times. 

My Advice

I just want to quickly say that doing any of the things I suggest below are not necessary. I know many girls on the soccer team that did the sort of thing I did – ECNL/ GA club showcases and big recruiting events – and also others who had never played in front of the coach in person before showing up to pre-season. The journey is not the same for everyone and following this advice does not guarantee anything, but for me, these tips are all things that I found to make a difference in my recruiting process. If I had to do it all over again, I personally would do the tips I’ve laid out below.

- Research schools that are a good fit. Do you want to play Division 1, Division 2, or Division 3? Do you want to earn a scholarship? Does the school offer the majors you’re interested in? What conference does the school play in (what teams would you be playing against)? Does the coach and team fit your vibe?

- Keep a running list of things you like about the school, their sports program, the team, and where you stand in terms of recruiting. 

- Be a good communicator: respond to that email or text message from a coach 
        within a reasonable time frame.
      


- Get in contact with the coach early by sending an email. Make sure your email header contains vital information, such as your name, position, graduation class, SAT score, or sport accomplishment.

- If you’re going to an ID camp, make sure the coach knows you will be there in advance by sending them an email. Say hi before the camp so they have their eye on you.

- Check which coaches are coming to your tournaments. Send them an email telling them your game schedule and that you would appreciate them swinging by. After the tournament, I would sometimes make quick highlight videos and send them to the coach. Even better if you see them at your game and talk to them.

- Make a scouting video of things you are really good at (soccer examples: long passes, defensive headers, playing under pressure, scoring goals, switching the field, etc). 

- You don’t need to go to a million ID camps – they’re expensive and time consuming, so pick and choose your priorities. I think I went to about eight camps.

- Be open minded. Sometimes you will go to a camp for one school in particular, but you will catch the eye of a different one. Don’t ignore that opportunity just because they weren’t the school you were originally going to the camp for. Really see what’s behind that door before you decide to close it. To be 100% honest: MIT wasn’t even on my huge list of schools I was considering before I happened to meet the coach at a camp. I’m beyond glad I kept an open mind.

That’s all I have for now! Wishing everyone the best of luck in the recruiting process, and I hope you find the school of your dreams :)

love this team! <3",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-16-at-15.47.59_cdc4d8dd-400x300.jpg,1
Polymer Police,Andi Q. '25,2,2025-02-16T00:00:00-05:00,"Yesterday, my mom had some “silk” scarves shipped to me so I could bring them back home after graduation. She was very excited about them, telling me how happy all her friends would be when she gave them these “100% pure silk” scarves as gifts. However, I was skeptical of these scarves as soon as I unboxed them. The packaging was incredibly suspicious, with the scarves arriving in a box that literally said “CHEMICAL TEXTILE” in big bold letters. They also didn’t look or feel like other silk fabrics I was used to. Plus, my mom ordered them on the internet, where anyone can say whatever they want.

I was convinced that these scarves were made of some synthetic textile like polyester, while my mom was convinced that “of course it’s real silk, Andi, why would anyone on the internet lie to you”. Short of having her come to MIT and feel the fabric herself, there was little arguing I could do to change her mind. Clearly, I needed a scientific test to determine conclusively what material the scarves were made of.

Unfortunately, by far the most common scientific test for silk is to… 
        burn the fabric
      
. I couldn’t possibly do that! Damaging the scarves in any way was out of the question, given that they might be made of real silk and my mom would be very sad if I burned her merchandise. I also didn’t want to cause a fire alarm and have everyone in my dorm freeze to death in the Boston cold.

But then inspiration struck. MIT has tons of high-tech lab tools for characterizing materials. What if I just used one of those tools to find the polymer structure of the fabric? Conveniently, MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering created the Breakerspace a year ago so that undergrads like me can use these tools for this exact purpose. 
        Spectroscopy
      
 doesn’t lie, so my mom would have to believe me after seeing the evidence!

Selecting the right tool to use was surprisingly difficult. Like the burn test, most of the tools would end up damaging the scarves in some way. For example, X-ray diffraction would involve grinding the fabric into a powder before irradiating it with X-rays, and Raman spectroscopy would involve shining a powerful laser onto the fabric (which would probably burn a hole into it). An electron microscope wouldn’t damage the fabric (although it would require me to cut out a small patch) and would tell me its chemical composition but wouldn’t reveal anything about the bonding structure, so that wouldn’t work either.

Luckily, the Breakerspace has the perfect tool for the job after all! Meet the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer:



The FTIR spectrometer works by shining infrared light onto a material and then measuring how much the material absorbs/transmits the light at different wavelengths. The resulting spectrum can then be used to identify the material because sharp changes in absorbance/transmittance correspond to specific bonds between atoms. This happens because molecules are like balls (atoms) joined together with springs (bonds), and so the speed at which each ball can wiggle (and thus which wavelengths of light the wiggling absorbs) is dictated by how heavy the ball is and how many springs are attached to it.

For example, here are the FTIR spectra of silk and polyester:


  
          
        
      
          
        
      
      
      Transmittance FTIR spectra that someone at the University of Tartu in Estonia measured.

And here are their polymer structures:


  
          
        
      
          
        
      
      
  

Silk’s FTIR spectrum (left) has a big dip that polyester’s spectrum (right) does not have. This dip is due to an oxygen-hydrogen bond stretching, which silk has (on the green part of the structure) but polyester does not have. Other differences between the two polymers (for example, silk has nitrogen while polyester has that hexagonal ring structure) contribute further to the differences between the spectra. 
        Very cool stuff,
      
 but I digress.

Anyway, the FTIR spectrometer was perfect for this little experiment for several important reasons:

- It only uses infrared light (and a tiny amount too), so there was almost zero risk of the tool damaging the fabric.

- There was almost no sample preparation required. I could quite literally drape the fabric over the tool and it would happily measure it. (See the image below.)

- It collects data very quickly. I think I had to wait less than a minute per sample.

- The data it collects is clean and consistent, which makes it very easy for me to identify the material.

Measuring a polyester t-shirt using the spectrometer.

So what did I find using the spectrometer?

Well…

Absorbance FTIR spectra that I measured for the scarf (top) and a polyester t-shirt (bottom). These look like flipped versions of the spectra from above because absorbance is almost the opposite of transmittance here.

The scarf’s FTIR spectrum almost perfectly matched that of silk! For good measure, I also collected an FTIR spectrum of a 100% polyester shirt, which also matched the expected spectrum. Great news for my mom, because the scarves were genuine as she had hoped.

… so I was wrong. Oops. Not quite the mic-drop ending I was hoping for, but oh well. I guess the moral of this story is to trust everything on the internet, because why would anyone on the internet lie to you.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0317.png

notes from a week of new classes,Aiden H. '28,3,2025-02-15T00:00:00-05:00,"New month, new classes, new semester, yet still my cramping hand sitting across MIT’s campus struggling to write for more than 30 minutes during lecture. I’m taking three technicals this semester, and if there’s one thing they all have in common, it’s that they’re gonna make you WRITE.

5.12 – Organic Chemistry

I do enjoy this class and it has gotten me more into chemistry, but lectures are lowkey (highkey) bad. The structure of the class really is made to give students as many materials to learn as possible, which is noble but very messy. Every class, there are slides posted, plus an extra notes sheet that has some of the info on the slides (but not all of it?). Already, I don’t know if I should take my own notes, write on the slides, or write on the notes handout. Then the professor writes on the blackboard during class, none of which is put onto the slides/notes handout. You would think this would mean you should take your own notes, but a TA is actually taking all the notes and posting them after, leaving three (3) different files for notes for every lecture, all with different amounts of material.

On top of this, a lot of the stuff I feel like I should takes notes on are definitional, but the professor just reads all of the definitions as fast as possible at the beginning of each lecture so “we know what’s coming”, instead of doing it logically by introducing a definition as it comes up in the lecture. I’ve found the textbook to be most helpful and the notes more as a catch-up than a comprehensive guide.

7.03 – Genetics

This class has an all-around better note structure than 5.12, but because the class tries to derive a lot of ideas through various test and trains of thought, sometimes the professor will go back in a different color to a table/chart/cross we ran earlier in lecture and update it/show what we proved/changed. This is really effective when learning, but it does result in me frantically trying to drag and drop different parts of my notes on my IPad so I have space to edit.

8.02 – Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism

Just like 
        8.01,
      
 this class is taught in the TEAL/flipped-learning style, with lecture videos at home replacing lectures, and “lectures” being practice problems/review with a professor and TAs. Most of my “notes” are coming from the at-home learning-sequences, of which all of the videos are free to view online through MIT 
        OCW!
      
 Because class is review and we do practice problems at whiteboards, I feel like I normally don’t have that much to write, but I end up having just enough to make a little section that is adding nothing to the aesthetic (major peeve).","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stereoisomers.jpeg-800x1256.png

[guest blog] y(I)APping,Fiona L. '27,2,2025-02-13T00:00:00-05:00,"This is a guest post by one of my friends, Heidi Z. ’27, one of the first friends I made here at MIT and my favorite “homegrown massachusettsian”. (shoutout DEAPS ’23!) As stated in this post, IAP is one of the most unique, liminal pockets of time at MIT, showing that a month can contain multitudes. I really hope you enjoy learning more about what a January at MIT can look like—I know I sure did :)

Hi, I’m Heidi Z. ‘27, a sophomore double majoring in 
        6 and 18
      
 at MIT! In high school, I loved browsing the blogs and imagining a future in Cambridge—having the opportunity to come full circle is honestly surreal. My favorite blogs were always just about how MIT students spent their days in classes, clubs, or hobbies, so I figured I would share something similar about this past 
        IAP
      
!

You might wonder, how much can you really accomplish in IAP?—turns out, quite a lot! Of course, everyone spends it differently and this was just what I found to be the best for me. I spent my last IAP not doing much and ended up feeling pretty sluggish going into the spring semester, so I decided to change it up this year. In this post, I’ll first cover some of the things I did and then present some surprising reflections I had about the whole journey.

here is a little bit more about me!

(1/3 – 1/11)

This opportunity was actually organized by Harvard’s Science Olympiad club—high school SciOly was what introduced me to geology and earth science, so it was refreshing to take a break from math and CS to revisit that passion. Over the fall semester, we organized a two-stage exam for students across India, culminating in a five-day in-person camp for the top 100 competitors!

I flew into New Delhi with six other undergrads, none of us having been to India before. After two days of touring Delhi and Agra, we headed to the host university, living in dorms for a week while proctoring exams across five science disciplines and running hands-on workshops. As the resident earth scientist of the group, I wrote and proctored the earth science exam and taught workshops on climate change and rock/mineral identification. Earth science is often overshadowed by subjects like chemistry and biology, so I was pleased to see the students genuinely engaged in my workshops. I even gave away the majority of my mineral collection—seeing the students’ faces light up as they carried home a piece of vanadinite made it worth it 
.

Besides interacting with students, I loved bonding with my fellow undergraduate mentors. Whether it was staying up late in our dorm room “working”, introducing Harvard students to MIT lingo, or enduring the horrors of 
        Cat Mario
      
, I couldn’t have asked for a better group of people to spend a week with in a foreign country. Turns out Harvard kids aren’t that peculiar! Some of them can be kind of okay…

i did not see the bean (1/12 – 1/16)

After my time in India, I landed in Chicago to visit my cousins and to attend an insight program at a quantitative finance company. These programs are great—they fly you out, give you a tour of the office, and introduce you to the industry. Sophomore year is a great time to explore and consider various careers, so attending events like this is really fun! Over the course of three days, we were introduced to both the trading and technology sectors of a quantitative finance company through simulations, chats with employees, and presentations/lectures. I especially loved shadowing traders and watching them work in real time.

What made this experience even better was that it was a women’s-only program, creating an incredibly supportive environment. I connected with some amazing women that I’ll hopefully get to meet again soon! And stepping outside the MIT bubble was honestly relieving. People were mostly amazed that we hadn’t started our spring semester yet while I really enjoyed learning more about the culture and customs at other universities.

i spent all my money! (1/17 – 1/19)

I decided to make a stop in New York City after realizing I have free will as a college student—I’ve never been on my own before. I stayed with an MIT friend who had graduated last spring, so it was also awesome to see him again! Catching up with friends is always fun.

Having no responsibilities for this period of time, I wanted to do all the classic tourist activities. As someone who has recently become a big musical fan: I watched 
        & Juliet
      
 and 
        Little Shop of Horrors
      
. Money-saving tip: try getting rush and/or lottery tickets! I was able to see both for <100 dollars total with great seats! I also visited the Met and MoMA and devoured a ton of delicious food at the expense of my bank account.

why do i do this to myself (1/20-1/25)

Back at MIT, it was prep week for MIT Science Olympiad! Every IAP, we bring ~1000 high school students to campus for one of the most competitive invitationals nationwide. The planning committee (PC) consists of ~30 undergrads who organize logistics, and we also have around ~40 event supervisors who write and proctor events. It’s an unforgettable experience and I’m always amazed that teams from as far as California and Hawaii appreciate our tournament.

This year, I really got to know my fellow PC members. There were a lot more people on campus than last year, so the work was quicker, the conversations were livelier, and the tournament ran smoother. Week-of could be hellish in the sheer amount of manual labor needed to be performed, but it’s so worth it in the end. The day of, we got up at 5:30AM and wrapped around around 11pm — my job as Publicity Head was basically manning the t-shirt booth for eight hours straight while giving directions to hundreds of lost high schoolers. I also co-hosted the Memes/Kahoot section of the awards ceremony, which was a nerve-wracking but fun experience! The day was exhausting but so rewarding—I wouldn’t change a thing.

some other stuff I guess

Less structured activities that I took part in:

- web.lab! It’s a student-run course here at MIT that teaches web development! I definitely wish I spent more time on this, but I ended up nonetheless with a cute little website called OliveTheAbove that lets you create your own hobby portfolio!

- Going back to my high school to take part in a school-wide panel about the college transition. I got a DM through Instagram randomly and decided why not? I also got to catch up with some of my friends still in high school.

- Visiting the Harvard Art Museum’s pigment collection through the 
        MIT Arts Scholars
      
.

- Volunteering at Harvard Science Olympiad! I got to reconnect with my friends from HUSO-India and getting to compare and contrast the inner workings of competitions was great.

hi, my thoughts?

As a nerdy, academically-focused high schooler, my social life in high school was definitely on the quieter side. Similar to many MIT students I’ve talked to, I had a small group of like-minded friends that I mostly kept to (but still love dearly). The most student-body-wide recognition I got was being dubbed “Best Brains” or something in our high school’s superlative contest…

Transitioning to college, I definitely struggled a lot initially: I watched friend groups form without me, events occur without my knowledge, and the hustle and bustle of MIT continue without my inclusion — even at MIT, being an introvert is not easy. After my first year, I thought I had learned to keep up with the constant rhythm of MIT. Unfortunately, a series of events led to difficulties both academically and socially last semester.

My initial goal for this IAP was to put the previous semesters behind me. I wanted to focus on the activities and classes I had signed up for – this was going to be strictly for myself. And in that sense, IAP by all accounts was quite a success! (yay)

But when I think back to the past month, I don’t actually think about the sheer number of events I attended; I think about the incredibly cool people I had the privilege of yIAPping to. The conversations I had and the unplanned moments of connection with a diverse array of people were so valuable that I honestly I don’t know what to make of it—it seems I only found so much social fulfillment by accident and spontaneity? In previous semesters, I put so much time and effort into deliberately trying to form friendships, while this supposed period of solo adventure turned into precisely the opposite.

To me, IAP has always represented a chance to explore, step outside the usual routine, and take on experiences that become nearly impossible once classes start. But this time, I learned that, despite the name, you don’t actually have to do it independently! Looking back, going the entire month without engaging in social activities would have felt pretty lonely.

More broadly, I guess what I’m taking away from this IAP is that there’s a balance to be found between actively working toward your goals and embracing unexpected opportunities? Taking life just a little less seriously (in both social and academic contexts) seemed to work well for me. Obviously, I can’t expect every month to go the same way as IAP did, but I’ll try to take the memories and learning experiences with me as I navigate the remaining semesters I have here.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3890-800x799.jpeg

UROP reveal!!,Aiden H. '28,3,2025-02-11T00:00:00-05:00,"It was inevitable. My MIT prophecy has been fulfilled. There was no path to nor desire for avoidance. 
        I’ve started doing research.
      
 Mind you, how could I not? Over 90% of MIT students will 
        UROP
      
 at some point, and January is just too dark and depressing for me not to have something to stress over. And as much as I have kept my blog-persona STEM-free and relatively non-nerdy in order to preserve the major amounts of street cred I have, I fear it must be discussed.

Late last semester, I sent in a bunch of UROP applications on 
        ELx
      
 and cold-emailed some labs to try and have a UROP for 
        IAP
      
 and spring, and wasn’t even met with rejection, just 
        plain non-response.
      
 One PhD student did respond though, we met a couple times before winter break to discuss what a project could look like, and now we meet once a week while I show him all of my data and explains to me what it means and what I need to do with it.

So, for the past month (and the rest of the semester), all of my non-class related energy is being put to my first UROP.

Without further ado, my project is…

As a prospective 
        6-7
      
 (or 
        10-B,
      
 we’ll see), this project is actually very relevant and pretty much what a lot of computational biologists are spending they’re time doing doing right now, which is cool because I feel important, but scary because I feel stupid compared to the other PhD people doing this.

From what I’ve heard (although it just generally varies greatly from project to project), this is a fairly unique UROP experience/project/dyanmic? And I’m loving it. While a lot of CS and/or bio UROPs are a part of a much larger project and a group of PhD students, often with multiple UROP students per project or group of projects, mine is just this one PhD student walking me through a short project from beginning to end on whatever we found interesting. Instead of having to acclimate to a lab that has been running for years, I got to go through data selection and project design individually with my mentor, and I’m the only person responsible for actually doing any of the lab (running the code, making the graphs, etc. etc.). This last part is especially freeing because I’m not rushing to match other people’s deadlines, so if I’m slammed one week there’s not any major repercussions.

With the lore and details out of the way, it’s time to get serious.

 

⚠️⚠️
        WARNING: MILDLY INTENSE SCIENCE AHEAD
      
⚠️⚠️

 

The crux of the project is something that is pretty common throughout comp bio right now as a result of developments towards free-to-use AI for microbiology. Basically, why wait millennia for nature to spurt out better proteins when I could try thousands of possibilities on my computer right now? I won’t go too much into the background of this issue or how it’s currently being solved, but this Veritasium video that was just posted explains everything very well if you’re interested or need a bio refresher.

The project is being mentally split into three stages:

- Data Selection/Collection – Choose a common enzyme family as a starting point, randomly sample the amino acid sequences of a bunch of its variants, and predict their structures computationally.  Notably, this meaning finding a way to numerically describe the shape and “fitness” of the active site so that active sites can be compared as better/worse later on.

- Mutate, mutate, mutate – Using existing structures, computationally “mutate” and “evolve” the sampled proteins sequences, and compare the structures of those mutated amino acid sequences to that of their originals (directed evolution). This kinda simulates evolution by just randomly mixing up sequences and seeing if anything better comes of it, but instead of having to have things die, I just press delete!

- Develop a model – Train a model (genetic algorithm) using the results from part 2  to understand how different mutations directly change the shape of active sites. Once the model is trained enough, it should be able to work both ways. Given a sequence, it should find the part of the sequence that describes the active site and be able to mutate it for the better. Given a desired active site, it should be able to back out the amino acid sequence that would result in said structure.

So far, I’m working on parts 1 and 2, with 1 mostly done.


        My advisor and I
      
 decided on starting with studying Cytochrome P450, a gigantic protein family that is easily accessible, large enough to sample, and well studied (as well as, like, biologically important but aren’t kinda most enzymes?).

I started by using UniProt, an online protein database, and searched the Cytochrome P450 family. The data in UniProt is organized hierarchically; family –> cluster –> sequence. Searching the P450 family lists clusters, which are just groups of sequences, big or small, that are found to be similar enough on an amino acid level, but all individually create one of the proteins in the Cytochrome P450 family. Cytochrome P450 has >1,000,000 different clusters, so I used UniRef50 (a program/search tool inside UniProt) that simplifies the sequences based on similarity. With a similarity of 90% or 100% (UniRef90 or UniRef100), sequences will be counted if they are 90% or 100% unique, respectively, leaving more sequences. UniRef50 only leaves sequences that are at least 50% unique,  and I make the assumption that sequences that are over 50% similar will have nearly identical structures in the end. This is a typical time vs accuracy tradeoff (I as one person cannot run 1,000,000 sequences, but running that many would technically be more accurate in the end).

This leaves >90,000 clusters. From here, I downloaded sequences from the top 10 clusters with the most sequences.  Amino acid sequences are downloaded as .fasta files, which are formatted with a “>” followed by the sequence name, and then the amino acid sequence on the following line.

Example fasta file (with only one sequence)

From there I randomly sampled 100 sequences from each cluster file, leaving me with 1000 sequences across 10 clusters that, after all the parsing, should be representative of the sequence population of >1,000,000.

Side note: You’ll save a bunch of time if you remember to check that there are no repeat sequences after you sample and not after you have a bunch of data already and it’s like 1:00 A.M. and you’re pissed! 🎉🎉

what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger – Kelly Clarkson

After this, I downloaded localcolabfold to run AlphaFold 2 (AF, henceforth), an AI system created by Google’s DeepMind that famously solved 
        Levinthal’s paradox.
      
 Since my MacBook doesn’t have the computing capacity to carry out running an AI system of this scale to any capacity, I secure shell log in to a GPU provided by MIT. Every time I ssh in, it gives me a cute picture:

Once I have access to the GPU, I run AF and get met with what can only be described as a shit ton of stuff.

running AF on three separate GPUs because I’m impatient

I had AF set to run 5 “recycles” of each sequence, meaning that each sequence is run 5 times, each prediction theoretically getting stronger (as it has the information of the previous cycles). Most importantly, I get a pLDDT (predicted local distance difference test) score for each cycle the sequence is run. This higher the pLDDT score (>80, mostly), the more accurate the prediction, and the AF output can be assumed to be nearly identical to what the actual protein would look like.

📣📣 Don’t underestimate or under-appreciate this! A computer was literally just given a list of capital letters and it’s accurately predicting how the basis of most microbiology folds and forms!! 📣📣

These pLDDT scores also give me a bunch of other files, most of which aren’t desperately important for me to explain. One fun one, though, is .pdb files, which give me the structure prediction. Using a separate software (Visual Molecular Dynamics), I can upload the file and mess around the with shape. When I get bored I treat it like MS Paint but for biomolecules.

brat but it’s a protein but definitely still brat because it keeps us alive

Another important output is the .json files, which pair sequence-pLDDT as keys-values in a dictionary. This allows me to run the next part, Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), a 
        huge
      
 model made by ex-Meta scientists. This is a transformer-based language model that allows me to turn the sequences into numerical data, vectorize them all into a huge array, and start to look at the differences between each of the clusters. This also gives me cute, encouraging messages.


        Eventually
      
 I will graph all of these to visualize exactly how representative my samples are of the population (color the original P450 and the cluster sequences differently, and see if I can see any of the original color). I will also start running the “mutation” part of the plan in the coming weeks, running an already created generative algorithm that mutates by essentially “swapping” amino acid sequences. I will choose a specific part of the sequence that two sequences share, and have everything before that point on the sequences stay as their original, and the rest switch. Since I’m trying to hone the active sites of the enzymes, I will have to find markers in the sequences that represent the amino acids that describe the shape of the active site, and chose this as the point for ESM to run. I drew a picture to explain because words are hard.



The output is a bunch of new sequences that are “randomly” evolved (except not because I’m making sure it’s evolving the active site). Most of them will probably be awful, but done enough times, I will get a new sequence that has an even better active site than either of the original sequences fed in, and BAM! every world issue is solved.

I’ll use all this in months to start developing a model, but I haven’t gotten that far so I am in no way qualified to even to try and talk about it.

Maybe I’ll make an update when I get that far, but for now, this is my life! Hopeful this inspired someone to do 6-7 and didn’t incite fear into anyone.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hand-mouse-cursor-clicks-the-reveal-secret-button-vector-21125086-800x864.jpg

SSP,Ellie F. '28,3,2025-02-10T00:00:00-05:00,"The Summer Science Program (SSP), which is co-sponsored by MIT, is a 39 day summer program in astrophysics, biochemistry, genomics, or synthetic chemistry. At each campus, 24 to 36 rising high school seniors collaborate to complete a meaningful scientific research project, learning the skills they need through a series of challenging lectures and problem sets. Learn more at https://summerscience.org/

Sophomore year was a lonely one for me. After a full year of virtual school, I had lost touch with many of my middle school friends, and I was slowly realizing that I had no one to talk to about 3blue1brown or NASA missions or programming challenges. My SSP application, then, was a plea for connection, a desire to meet people outside of the bubble I was in. 

Any fears I might have had about fitting in or finding friends were dashed within an hour of my arrival. I had just finished unpacking, and my room was missing a trash can. I went downstairs to find one, and instead found myself chatting with a few other students as time fell away. By dinnertime, the entire downstairs common room was filled with new people and bright, easy conversation. I found out later that my mom, after waiting half an hour for me to return, had just gone and gotten the trash can herself.

a double rainbow on the first full day of SSP. the metaphors write themselves

In my six weeks at SSP, my priority was to make as many memories with my new friends as possible. On weekdays, those of us willing to get up for breakfast would play Wordle and its dozens of variants. After all our lectures for the day, we’d pile into the computer lab to pset, singing songs from West Side Story and Hadestown as we worked, and taking breaks to doodle on the board. We’d laugh about the scenarios on our psets or just commiserate over the hardest parts. In the evenings, once I was done with my work, I’d go back to the dorm and sink into the couch and talk and talk and talk until silent time, and then whisper until the TAs told us to go to our rooms. If my team was observing at night, we’d gossip and swap music tastes as we waited for exposures in the tiny, dark observatory in the foothills of a desert mountain.

On Saturdays, we’d pile into a bus to Walmart, which, in our tiny New Mexico town, was a destination akin to Disneyland. Precious free time went to a pool trip, or exploring the on-campus geology museum, or worshipping a second-edition copy of Newton’s Principia Mathematica in the library. When we found out that the tiny one-room theater was showing the new Minions movie, we all walked a mile under the hot desert sun in our formalwear, feeling like we were in some teen summer movie, except one where the characters also tracked asteroids across the sky for fun. Sunday evenings were movie nights, where we’d make popcorn and watch classic science fiction films, calling out the astronomy jargon we were now familiar with, cheering when Socorro, New Mexico, our home away from home, was featured in Contact. 

On my last observation shift, the sky was the darkest and clearest I had ever seen. After we set up exposures for the Eagle Nebula, my friends and I laid down on the sidewalk outside the observatory and stared up at the faint Milky Way stretching above. A shooting star arced overhead, with a trail that lingered for a few seconds, as if to convince me it was real, and not a spark of my imagination. It was easy, in those late nights, when I was wrapped up in the glittering sky with bugs chirping in my ear, to imagine that New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment, was really magical. 

To a 16-year-old me, the kind of STEM-based community that SSP gave me was impossible to even conceive of. Even now, it astounds me. At SSP, I learned over and over that somehow, every single person there was singularly incredible. Everyone had lived such different experiences, and they all had hobbies and skills and passions in so many different areas that conversations could go on for hours without ever getting old. 

It’s now been nearly 3 years since I last saw most of my SSPeople in person, but that’s not to say they’re gone. We helped and supported and celebrated each other through college applications, and now we keep up through dms and group chats. I’ve stayed with one SSPer in her room at Yale, and visited two more at Columbia when I took a day trip to New York. Some of my SSP friends now attend MIT with me, and when anyone visits Boston, we reminisce and catch up over lunch. It’s no surprise, of course, when I learn that my SSPers, some of the most amazing people I’ve ever met, have continued to be amazing over the past few years.

If I had to point to a single thing that has led me to where I am now, it would be SSP. Even apart from the community I’ve been gushing about, it introduced me to astrophysics, a field I adore and that I’ve been studying and researching in ever since. Through SSP, I accessed resources and technologies that were simply impossible to obtain by myself. From my SSPers, I’ve gotten invaluable advice about high school, college applications, and MIT life. More intangibly, I gained the confidence that I had the independence, responsibility, and skill needed to thrive in a place as fast-paced and intense as SSP. 

SSP brands itself as the “educational experience of a lifetime,” but to only focus on education is selling it short. In almost every possible area, SSP has changed my life.

P.S. I wrote my first-ever blog at SSP, while I was quarantined from Covid. Read a younger Ellie’s mid-SSP thoughts here: https://summerscience.org/isolation-i-miss-you-guys/","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-day-1-2-1000x750.jpg

clay crash course,Gloria Z. '26,4,2025-02-10T00:00:00-05:00,"This IAP, I took pottery classes! Between class time, open studio, and one-time workshops, I threw on the wheel for an average of eight hours a week. Every weekend, I would walk 35 minutes or so past Fenway, a scarf wrapped tightly around my ears, listening to an audiobook or music or the whistling of the city. My destination, Brookline Arts Center, sat right next to St. Mary’s stop on the green line, across the street from Japonaise Bakery; it was a squat, proud building with a large yard and wrought-iron gates, with a high square window on the facade. Then it was hours of pushing wet mud forward; scraping redness off the wheel; and pulling, with trembling fingers, timid, slippery walls up to the sky. Too thin or too splayed and they crumpled, and I started all over again, spinning.

After class, I’d change out of my clay-crusted clothes, crack flakes of earth off the hems, and take the green line then the 1 bus back to campus. I loved these weekly jaunts into Boston–the walk brought me right down Commonwealth, past Kenmore, through Fenway, and into Brookline. (One of the many luxuries of IAP is to be able to spend hours just walking around, with no psets or deadlines in mind.) In the summer after freshman year, I had actually lived right next to Kenmore, so it was nice seeing the familiar sights and realizing, after a few times, that I no longer needed to consult Google Maps at every turn. 

After each session, as I sat on the T, I would note down everything I had worked on that day, what had succeeded and what had failed. This blog is an abridged collection of those notes, logging one month of ceramics progress.

(Disclaimer: I didn’t go in completely new–I’d attended a wheelthrowing workshop last year, and the year before, I had taken half of a four-session wheelthrowing class with MIT Arts Studios. So I knew enough to know that throwing is way harder than it looks, but I hadn’t retained much of the actual muscle memory.)

week 1: the basics

To start, the instructor tasked us with throwing the most fundamental shape: a straight, even cylinder. They broke it down in steps:

1) Pat the clay into a ball and lob it onto the wheel, aiming for the center.

.

2) Center the clay. From this step onwards, the wheel is kept spinning and the clay is kept wet. In the centering process, you push in firmly to force the clay up and down until it reaches a radially symmetric conelike shape. It’s important that the clay is properly centered, as otherwise the resulting pot will be asymmetric and it’ll be a lot harder to control.

.

3) Drill a hole. Using your thumbs (or pointer fingers, or something else), “dive” into the middle of the centered clay to start creating the inner cavity. Stop when you reach your desired floor thickness–this can either be gauged visually or with a needle tool.

.

4) Widen the cavity. Pulling outwards with fingers inside of the drilled hole, slowly widen it until you reach your desired floor width. You’ll end up with something that looks like a donut with flat inner walls.

.

5) Pull the walls upwards. Gathering the excess clay from the outside of the lump, slowly pull upwards to elongate and thin out the walls. You’re looking for a slightly tapered triangle, thickest at the base. Make sure you pull evenly, as fluctuations in wall thickness can make your pot unstable. Repeat until satisfied! This is the exciting part, where you can define the shape and character of your vessel. 

.

6) Make finishing touches. Scrape off excess clay at the foot of your pot; use a needle or wire tool to even out the rim; round the lip over with a soft sponge; and glide your kidney tools over the inside and outside walls to scrape off excess slip.

.

7) Slice your piece off the wheel with your wire tool, and set it somewhere safe to dry! 

.

We started with lumps of clay that were about one pound each. It’s easier to center smaller amounts of clay, because they exert less force on your palms, but as a result, you’re limited in how big you can make your vessels. At the end of week 1, I ended up with the following bowl and two mugs:

they look bigger in this picture than they are lol

My takeaways from week 1:

- The speed of the wheel is important! It’s controlled with a foot pedal whose angle corresponds directly to the velocity, and my instinct was to just leave it at the same speed the whole time. However, because of physics, spinning faster gives you more leverage when pushing the clay, but it also exerts more centrifugal force on the clay body’s walls, potentially spreading them wider than intended. Similarly, spinning slower gives you more precision and is less likely to cause deformations, but you have to brace your fingers and move more slowly when pulling, lest you create a spiral upwards. Generally, I found that starting at the fastest speed while centering and slowly decreasing the speed with each subsequent step worked well for me.

- There’s no “correct” form for throwing. It’s truly vibes-based… all the instructors I’ve seen and the pottery videos I’ve watched feature slightly different techniques and hand positionings, especially when it comes to centering. In the class, we were encouraged to try out different ways of bracing our fingers, using our tools, controlling the amount of water on the clay, etc., to find out what techniques were most intuitive and effective for us.

week 2: centering city

In week two, I increased the amount of clay I was working with to 1.5-2 pounds and really focused on centering. It was definitely a struggle to wrangle the larger lumps, and I started using both hands to keep the clay in place, having previously just been using my right palm. Centering tends to take me a long time–lots of coning up and down, accidentally introducing irregularities, and then having to correct those issues–so one of my goals is to get faster, so I can get to the fun part of actually shaping the vessel. At the end of week 2, I had kept the following two bowls:

the one in the back is a matcha bowl for my friend’s birthday

And I had attached my first handle, to a lopsided cylinder I made back in the first class.

it’s in the top right

I also trimmed my two small cups from the previous week, shown above between the two bowls! Trimming occurs when a piece has dried about halfway and reached a texture referred to as “leather hard”; in this process, the pot is affixed to the wheel either with water or pieces of soft clay, and slowly “pruned” (idk how else to describe it). Here, potters can add features like a foot ring, carved patterns and ridges, and holes, or just smooth out and refine the shape overall. However, edits made at this stage are permanent, and although you can make a lot of edits still, the overarching shape of the vessel can’t really be changed anymore.

completely realistic diagram

Takeaway from week 2:

- Learning > end product. When you finish throwing something, you can either keep it (to be trimmed, fired, glazed, etc.), or you can slice it in half with your wire tool to see the cross section. This essentially allows you to see how well you did–if your walls are even, if the floor is the thickness you thought it was, and if the shape is what you intended. The instructor emphasized that although you do want to end up with finished pieces in the end, in order to improve as a potter, it’s important to slice (and therefore destroy) most of your pieces in the beginning so you can effectively adjust your technique. I tried to take this to heart–either slicing my pieces after deeming them finished, or just pulling and increasing the size of my pots until they collapsed, to see just how large I could make them.

week 3: bowls!!

I came into week 3 with two goals: improve my centering technique and make some bowls! Because of the way I center, I often end up with a wide, low skirt of clay at the bottom of my piece. This isn’t an issue for the final pot because I can scrape off the excess with a wooden rib tool and recycle it, but it does lead to a lot of clay that doesn’t make it in. So if I started with 2 pounds, I might end up only using 1.7 or 1.5 effectively. I wanted to improve the way I cone and manage the clay during centering in order to end up with more of a gumdrop rather than bell curve shape:

.

My second goal was to make some bowls! The steps for a bowl versus a straight cylinder are slightly different, but the principles are the same. The instructor advised me to set the wheel to a very low speed – lower than I would think – when pulling/expanding the bowl walls, and I found that this gave me a lot more control over the shape. I ended up keeping the following:

yay

Takeaways from week 3:

- Warm up! I started one of my sessions this week by throwing a little cylinder with a .75lb lump of clay, and I think it helped me get back into the groove of throwing without immediately jumping in with two pounds. It’s enough material to make a teeny espresso cup or ring dish :).

- Do the first few pulls with a wet sponge instead of my fingers. Basically, when beginning to pull the walls, I was struggling to get the clay up from the skirt of the pot without just scooping it right off the wheel. This is partly because of the problem I was working on last week, where I tended to leave a lot of clay in the skirt when centering. However, outside of that issue, there’s just always a lot of clay to bring up and smooth out at the beginning. I found that using a wet sponge on the outside of the wall and fingers on the outside helped me a lot more for those first two pulls. Then, I would switch back to fingers on both sides, enabling me to feel the thickness of the wall more accurately for the final pulls.

weeks 4-5: trimming & painting

In the last couple sessions, we trimmed, underglazed, and glazed our pieces. They actually get fired twice: first, to go from greenware (basically just dried clay) to bisqueware (fired, very hard/durable, but not food-safe), and second, to vitrify the glassy glaze. Unfortunately, tragedy struck after the bisque firing–the matcha bowl developed a tiny hairline crack…

:((

This meant that the piece was no longer watertight, or functional as a matcha bowl. I did still glaze it, just to see how the color turned out, but I couldn’t use it as a gift anymore :(. 

Fortunately, the other pieces I put into the bisque firing did survive. Some I ended up scrapping before the firing, for the sake of not cluttering my dorm room, but the ones I did underglaze/fire/glaze are below. I’m especially excited about the berry bowl/colander and the bowl with birds on the side!

praying to the kiln gods

Don’t be fooled by the matte, muted colors of the glazes in the picture – after the firing, they’ll solidify into beautiful glossy colors through some chemical witchcraft. I won’t actually get to pick up my pieces for another month or so, depending on the studio’s kiln schedule, so I don’t have pictures of them for this blog (sorry to end on a cliffhanger). But I’ll definitely be posting a pottery update later this semester, and they’ll be in there. Speaking of which…

I’m super excited to be taking an intermediate wheelthrowing class this semester in the student center pottery space! It comes with studio access outside of class times, meaning I can practice whenever I want. I’d like to get better at throwing large vessels so that I can illustrate them, combining my drawing/painting experience with pottery. Also, at the end of the semester, if my friends and I have produced enough functional pots, we want to try to hold a little ceramics pop-up fundraiser.

I really love how process-focused pottery is: my instructor emphasized the idea that if you make something once, you should be able to make it again, and I think this helps me detach from the final product and really just invest in the process. It’s also so gratifying to be able to make functional objects that people can use in their daily lives–that aspect of utility is so special. Form and function fr.

some inspo to bless your eyes… (aka the reason why I wanted to start ceramics in the first place lol):

anatomy of a freshman year 🦴🧠🩸🖐️🫀,Fiona L. '27,4,2025-02-09T00:00:00-05:00,"bones

there would be no body without the bones. just how there would be no “college” without the hallmarks typically associated with the classic american college experience: classes, clubs, a diverse group of students smiling and laughing while sitting on a perfectly sunlit lawn under a tree.

in my freshman year, i aimed to get my 
        girs 
      
done following the advice of my amazing first year advisor, adam albright. i was disappointed about my advisor placement at first, since i had only applied for advising seminars (includes both advising and a weekly exploratory seminar) and had been placed with a traditional advisor (only advising) instead. but mit’s beloved linguistics professor “prof. albright”, or “adam”, as i knew him, easily found a way into my heart. in our meetings throughout my first semester, we chatted about major plans, extracurriculars, life at mit and how “there are so many ways to be a spider”.


my first semester, i took 3.091
 and 8.022 : the former was a pretty standard gir class experience. i wasn’t as interested compared to the classes in my major that i would take later on. but i saw a lot of 
        familiar faces
      
 and some new information about chemistry. 8.022 was more memorable. i had opted to take 8.022 instead of the “standard” version of physics because i was still stuck in the mindset of always defaulting to the “hardest things available”. looking for challenge, i definitely got what i asked for. i talked to the professor about whether or not i should drop to 8.02 after a particularly disastrous midterm. stubbornly, and a bit riskily, i decided not to. through a combination of psetting with friends, attending office hours, and getting outside help, i somehow managed to scrape through in that class. i think 8.022 for me was what a lot of new students need coming into mit. being thrown into the deep end of mit’s potential for academic rigor, all with the safety net of 
        pnr
      
 beneath us. i could no longer get away with viewing my academics as something “trivial”. instead, i had to develop the study habits i’d been neglecting for the first 18 years of my life.

in my freshman spring, i took 21m.701, drawing for designers. the class gave me a brief window of time every week where i was “forced” to dedicate the time to drawing, a hobby that i wanted to get into but never really put a lot of time into. here are some of the pieces i made during that class:

i also took 12.409, hands-on astronomy, where i learned how to use a telescope to observe stars from atop the roof of 
        building 37
      
, as well as the locations of major stars and constellations and some terminology covering the coordinates of stars. other perks include being able to go to Wallace observatory, about an hour drive from mit, and get your own photo of an astronomical object. it’s a decent class (maybe slightly overhyped unless you’re really into astronomy), but i feel like i didn’t get as much out of it as i should’ve. my photo of an astronomical object ended up just being a picture of space—apparently, i had entered the coordinates wrong.

on the extracurricular side of things, i feel like i “tried” a whole host of different activities:  
        Lecture Series Committee (LSC)
      
, Digital Art & Animation @ MIT (DAAMIT), The Tech, Asian Dance Team (ADT), Next Sing, to name a few. 
 but the student org i gravitated towards the most, 
        ESP
      
, gave me two things, things i now look for in every student org i consider joining: things that i genuinely wanted to do, and a tight knit community i feel that i belong in. when i felt that a group lacked one or both of these things, i didn’t feel as much as a desire to get highly involved.

ESP ran programs for high schoolers and middle schoolers in the area 
, including Splash, Spark, Spring HSSP, and Cascade. it was also an amazing community, with a large messenger chat that was always active, and a room in the fourth floor of the stud that i could go to at any time, even odd hours of the night, and find somebody to chat or co-work with. they were incredibly supportive as mentors to my naive frosh self, and constantly looking for ways to improve as a club and restructure old systems in a better way. their documentation was impressive, and alumni seemed to want to come back and visit as well. another amazing thing about the club was their approach to failure. i did so many things wrong / non-ideally while learning how to run programs, but i was never ever made to feel like i messed up or that anything was my fault.

i still think fondly of all my time spent with ESP both inside and outside the club, including when i went to new hampshire for a club retreat with them. we had an event called juice bar, where the freshmen concocted “juices” out of various substances for the upperclassmen to enjoy. i’ll never forget the reaction when i brought out “The Kid Who Flew All The Way from California to Attend MIT Splash”, a juice featuring avocado, soy sauce, and a few other ingredients that i can no longer remember. 


i also did a
        urop
      
 during 
        iap
      
 and spring semester, which focused on designing an ai tool meant to help comic artists storyboard.

one of the pictures generated by the tool!

during my 
        fpop
      
, i got the advice of not getting a urop my freshman fall, which i disagree with. 
 i felt that i personally could’ve definitely benefited from experiencing more of mit while i was on pnr, and the advice wasn’t one-size-fits-all for all freshmen. i really liked getting a peek into what life as a grad student was like, as well as how research projects operated. i even got to contribute to some of the paper that my team was writing through a literature review! despite this, i felt that a lot of my work ended up being rote, and i could have advocated for myself more during the urop.

i think something that i took away from all of my freshman year was to do a good job to whatever i commit to. through my own 
        experiences
      
 i saw the human cost of what happened when somebody half-assed the commitments. freshmen are told that “upperclassmen will understand”, although from my point of view, dropping a club too late or without communication, or “silently dropping” a club by simply disappearing or half-assing things, can make things a lot harder for others, who then have to pick up the slack. plus, i think having a positive reputation as somebody who works hard and can generally be relied on to do certain things is quite valuable as well.

skin

skin is the barrier between the self and the outside world. in terms of mit, it’s the harvard bridge connecting mit and boston. i crossed this bridge many times, whether i was visiting a museum, going to a comic expo, or attending freshman formal at the top of the prudential. along the way, i went to plymouth over thanksgiving weekend and visited cape cod.

but the idea of “skin” appears again in social context. to “have a thick skin” means to listen to criticism from others without letting it affect how you feel. it presents the skin as the barrier separating your feelings from others.

in my first semester, confined to one of the smallest triples in 
        simmons
      
, i struggled a lot with the inconveniences of living in a college dorm. that was when i realized how much my emotions could run out of control day after day without a consistent routine and the coziness of my old life. i hated being woken up because a roommate had early morning classes, i hated having to do laundry every week, i hated being late to school because i had left 12 minutes early because of 15.

during my freshman fall, i sometimes felt it when i was at my most frustrated. in my stomach, and in all the air i breathed, a wizened loneliness took root. i wanted so badly for somebody to help me, to tell me they had felt every frustration i’ve felt before and that they would help me through everything that came ahead. i felt that 
 there was nobody in the world who could understand my loneliness, this awful feeling that turned my previously planar life into jagged geometries. everybody who truly cared about me was over a thousand miles away, and i was left to fend for myself in this world where everybody seemed to know each other and was doing better than me.

it took a long longer for me to finally find “my people,” but in the end, without even noticing the exact moment, it happened. i didn’t have to look too far. these people were “hiding” in my living group, in my classes, and in the clubs i was in. all i had to do was be patient, to wait for the right string of conversations to pull us together, before one day i would find them sitting comfortably in my heart.

i think the number of people i grew to trust increased exponentially for me. friends introduced me to friends, and i bonded and got to know more new people. i am reminded of something that would happen whenever i tried to paint in watercolor. i’d use too much water here or too much paint there, and suddenly, a tiny window of color would bleed into its neighbors, consuming everything in its wake. i feel like that pocket of color, bleeding into my neighbors, except, inadvertently, i’d absorb a little fraction of their colors, a little fraction of what made that group of friends grow closer together.

hair

in chinese culture, healthy hair is considered a sign of prosperity and vitality. to be honest, i never knew about that aspect of “my own” culture. my parents were pretty practical about hair 
, down to the point where my mom had me wash my hair in vinegar to get rid of lice. to me, hair is more like a record of time. i dyed my hair dark brown after graduating from high school. it’s not a color that’s really unnatural or stands out, but it’s obvious to see the boundary straddling my skull, a delicate shoreline separating the natural and unnatural, reminding myself that i can never really change the color underneath. as i’ve stumbled through my post-high-school life, that thin line started to fall, as if it represented that very date—may 25, 2023, my high school graduation—being pushed further in the past. yet it still stayed, as well as the brown section of my hair beneath it, just like my high school self, who found an alcove in my consciousness and hid there, refusing to fade into irrelevancy as i started a new chapter of my life.

i could feel its presence, a little bit. in what my favorite teachers had taught me coming back in my girs, in my unquenchable need for academic validation that now went unfilled, in my inability to manage my life without a parent in it. but there were parts of my old self that i really wanted to stick to.

in high school, i built my extracurricular identity almost entirely around being a “teen writer.” i dove head-first into one of the most fascinating microcosms of overachieving high schoolers, one where you’d regularly encounter teens with the publication history of an accomplished 40-year-old writer, where an acceptance to a top summer camp is your ticket to meet the fellow high schoolers whose words you’ve obsessed over and analyzed and tried to emulate in a thousand different unconscious ways. i joined discord servers of other high schoolers who identified as “teen writers,” and together we sent our writing to literary magazines, crumbled over the biggest names in high school writing competitions—Scholastic, Foyle, YoungArts—and, ultimately, shared our admissions to top colleges.

in my freshman fall, i tried to force myself to write every week. consistency was something i struggled with, as i preferred to either procrastinate something eternally or go all into it for one or two days. it took a lot of mental energy to write something every week, but it helped a lot to force myself to write at regular intervals, and be pleasantly content with the results, rather than wait for “inspiration” to strike. 
 i am a firm disbeliever in writers block, since i think it’s possible to put yourself in a state to generate ideas by forcing yourself to work at certain times, until it becomes routine.

but for these pieces, i didn’t send them in to any magazines. i wanted to write without the promise of publication or recognition anywhere down the line. because even when i was young, i loved writing. when i was five, i made little booklets of stories: trashy, terrible stories with nonsensical endings, typos, and an obvious self-insert named “Fiona”. each page would have a tacky, crayon pictures of whatever scene i was imagining in my mind. i would “sell” these stories to my dad, and he would pay me in spare change. as i grew older, i stuck with writing even when i didn’t *like* it, when it got hard or i ran out of ideas or i hated my own work, which is how i knew i *loved* it.

heart

the heart always acts as a symbol of love and emotion, the eternal arch-nemesis and reluctant collaborator to the brain. but from a scientific standpoint, i never understood that. perhaps, the heart is even one of the most methodical, unemotional parts of the body. if it even dared to sleep or take a rest, the body would collapse into a corpse, like an entire city robbed of light. and so it continues to beat, over and over, the most diligent worker in my library of organs.

during freshman year, i learned a lot about routines and consistency. as i stayed up late engaged in deep conversation, or skipped studying to hang out with friends, i saw how my work suffered because of these choices. yet those interactions with others were the best i’ve ever had, and i felt that i’d always look back on my present with unblemished nostalgia. i felt like i was responsible for creating the memories that my future self could cling onto in the dregs of adulthood.

responsibility, and the development of it, as well as self improvement as a whole, has always been an incredibly important subject to me. as a kid, i used to be incredibly irresponsible, always forgetting about homework deadlines and pushing work to the last minute. it took a lot of practice to become a more responsible person throughout high school. i thought that would be enough, but mit presented itself as a tougher challenge to me: there was a constant stream of interesting events, and schoolwork that was more rigorous and more abundant.

expected value calculations, in theory, seem to be a good way to live life. i’d just constantly choose to do what brought the greatest value to my life. but in 24.00 , i learned about “diversity of value.” how two things are so different they can never be compared, how one can never be more valuable than the other. whether i chose sleep, or work, or my friends, i’d always be “missing out” on a near infinite number of other things i could be doing.

this is something i’m still working on, as i try to balance friends, school, sleep, applications, shifting my finger around until i find the center of gravity of my life.

brain

my brain thought a lot about itself during my freshman year. i came to mit after being hailed as a “math genius” at my high school, who leaned a little bit too much into the identity of loving math and programming, who came to not just crave academic validation, but expect it. at mit, i learned that in terms of ego, a common saying applies. “the higher you go, the harder you fall.”

i remember, freshman fall, checking canvas to see that i had gotten a 59 on my first midterm in 8.022. this was indicative of many things: i was still very much adjusting to the college experience, i had no good support systems at the time, i had incredibly poor study habits, and scores that were considered “bad” in high school can actually be quite “good” in college. but my brain only thought one thing: i am stupid. there were people around me who had founded entire companies, published award winning research, and had gone to international olympiads. i had no research experience, had never created anything “really cool” in high school , and my scores on academic competitions paled against my peers’.

i very much blindly idolized mit as a high schooler. all my mit fantasies glazed over the possibility of me becoming a #academicvictim in college…

freshman spring was no better. 
 i learned that, at mit, there are a lot of common ways to think about grades and self worth, and most of them aren’t very good for you. i think i fell into that trap after the “grace period” of pnr was lifted.

because of the attitude i had in freshman year, as well as some very flawed things that others had said to me, i came to believe that intelligence was something that could be inferred from grades, and that i had to define myself and my own performance based on somebody else’s standards. it was hell, for both my self-esteem and how i viewed my classes, and my excessive doomerism about what grade i was going to get in a class sometimes got in the way of me focusing on the material.

how i feel thinking about the grind

but looking back on it, i think that putting people on a pedestal for their intelligence or their gpa is something adjacent to objectification. 
 you’re essentially defining somebody in a very one-sided way based solely on one, superficial aspect of themselves. it’s one thing to admire somebody’s work ethic, study habits, or focus, but a whole other thing to idolize people. when it happened to me back in high school, it make me dependent on validation and gave me a false sense of self that only served to hurt me in my college years.

i was lucky to be surrounded by many people who didn’t have toxic ideas about grades. around these people, i knew i would never be judged for how i did in a class, and that i would never be forced to share a grade if i didn’t want to. they let me know something that everybody should keep in mind when going through college—grades don’t matter.

at mit, my entire identity isn’t dependent on being smart. i quickly stopped trying to over-present as “the math kid 📚✖️➕➗🔢” after coming to mit. i also found the freedom to fail or do average or say 
        “not very smart things”
      
 here without worrying too much about “oh no what if random strangers dont think im super duper smart anymore”. in addition, it’s nice to not have everything come incredibly easily. being average in any environment means that you have to work for basically everything, but that you can do almost anything by working extremely hard. 


for the time being, i’ve decided to try not sharing my final grades with anybody in my technical subjects. this includes if i get an a in a class. it’s not because i don’t trust people, or because i want to be secretive, it’s more of a deal i have with myself. 
 i know i tend to get worried about other people’s perceptions sometimes. i want to make myself get used to operating outside of that, to know for certain that i am not studying for the sake of my friends/classmates and that i can evaluate my performance in a subject by my own standards, and with full knowledge (aka not just a letter grade) of how that semester went for me.

hands

as an mit student, i cannot talk about the brain without following up with the hands. (as per mit’s motto, menus et manus, meaning “mind and hand,” which i think matches mit’s commitment to intellectual pursuits as well as creation of all kinds)

with my hands, i made things ranging from a 
        metal casted pear
      
 to a 
        glass pumpkin
      
 to a rug of kirby. i took classes and workshops that held even the slightest to me, and ended up with a bunch of knowledge about devices i’d never even seen before coming to mit. i also signed up for a bunch of makerspace trainings, which are free and available here! my favorite was the sewing training, where i followed along in making a pencil case that i still use now!

freshman fall was when i started to get into crochet, because one of my roommates at the time, sharon z ’27, had a cute penguin on her bedframe that she made from a crochet kit. i then impulsively ordered some crochet kits off of amazon, and got to work.

at the same time, in 6.101 
 i learned to make programs ranging from an 
        SAT Solver
      
 to a game of snake.

i realized a love of making cool things, both in and outside of my classes. i loved the feeling that i, a person with little experience in making digital and physical things, could still create projects from raw materials that were coherent, functional, and sometimes even pretty.

but it wasn’t just making ~things~ that excited me. i found that my hands 
. could also make interesting events happen. i organized the first [redacted] family dinner, bringing a bunch of mit affiliates with my surname together, sold clothing on dormspam, and walked through the halls of mit dressed in a pear costume. i realized that here in college, i had a lot more freedom to simply make cool things happen. and with this freedom, i stretch the bounds of my imagination on what can be done in pursuit of entertainment 
. after all, i had more than enough passionate, creative people around me, some of whom were happy to help or co-collaborate.

blood

writing the rest of this post was not completely easy. i think of writing about my self like trying to domesticate an ecosystem of wild memories. there are some memories that come easily after being prodded, hundreds of words flowing easily onto the page. there are some memories that feed off of each other, that prey on one another, that cannot stand even being in the same room together. there are memories which are nicked and scarred, which hide in the dark recesses of the mind, often referenced but not often remembered. they come out as a few words at a time, then a deep pause, then deletion, then a few more words. it’s never easy to write about these memories, especially when i know there’s an audience. but there’s something cathartic about writing about them, a way of reorganizing and recategorizing my struggles, in the hopes of viewing things objectively enough to learn lessons from the past.

after both my freshman semesters, i remember turning to instagram and seeing people’s “semester recaps”. i saw pictures of every living group and student org under the sun, and rows upon rows of smiling friends. i guess i had those too, but i had a lot of being confused and doing stuff incredibly badly and feeling incredibly, incredibly lonely along the way. i know, i know, i know the obvious sentiment that instagram does *not* reflect reality, but surrounded by so many pictures of so many “successful” first years, i couldn’t help but feel if i was the odd one out, or if everybody else “knew something” that i didn’t.

sometimes, including now, i think about whether or not i am/was happy. my own mental state was (and still is) the reserve of energy on which everything else depended—the routines in my life, my academic performance, my social interactions, and so much more. if i was motivated, if i was optimistic, if i was dedicated to doing a good job, if i put intrinsic over extrinsic motivation. in every action i took, a little bit of what was going in my mind was left behind as residue, like the faint memory of a fingerprint on everything i touched. it was like blood, the reserve of energy flowing through my body.

“i’d rather be unhappy here than happy anywhere else,” i remember saying to a friend. i don’t think this was the best way to express my sentiment, since i think there are definitely problems with overwork at this school that i don’t want to play into and let ruin me. but what i meant was that all the challenges i experienced here, whether i took them on (difficult classes, a packed schedule) or not (issues with loneliness, homesickness, not knowing how to live day-to-day independently), have pushed me into a period of unprecedented growth.

there are different types of happiness. the happiness you get at completing a bunch of easy challenges is very different than the happiness you get at completing something very difficult. one is feeling dopamine in the moment, yet mentally knowing that you have not used your time in the best way possible. the other is a lot of struggling and gathering the courage to ask questions, and maybe having your self image be called into question, but knowing that you are growing so, so much.

last year, there were points where i felt at the top of the world, and there were points where i felt close to utter despair.

its tough having Moods. some days here, i just feel like i go through the whole spectrum of human emotion in just an hour.

i don’t think anything will be accomplished by trying to describe it with the binary label of “happy” or “sad”, or even to rate it on a one dimensional scale. so i’ll think about it in terms of growth. a year does not make a perfect body, or a perfect blog post, and the beginnings do not perfectly rupture into endings. i am still following the different threads, retracing my steps to uncover clues as to where they will lead. but i know that as long as i persevere, i will come closer to the progress i seek.

sometimes, i think about my freshman year like a ride on a river. it is rough and i am always scared i will fall into the water and drown. the wind lets and i think i might get stuck on the water forever. but would that really be such a bad place to be? yet when i take a moment to breathe. to notice the place i am in and all the infinite places i could go, radiating out of this precious present like light passing through the hundred facets of a gem. i realize i am holding something so tender in my hands that i barely know what to do with. the present is really such a funny thing. it’s the one thing i ignore the most, despite it always being there. in all these moments reminiscing about the past to create this blog post, or thinking about how i will make things better for the future, how many intangible increments of time have i let slip into the past?","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zV121ZH7RTKxV_I9HBpLTw-e1738943168410-800x600.jpg

It’s Not Bra-Ket Science,Andi Q. '25,3,2025-02-07T00:00:00-05:00,"I don’t believe in quantum physics.

Yes, I know that all the math works out beautifully. And that no experimental evidence has ever disproven it. And that my smartphone – its tens of billions of transistors, LEDs, and other semiconductor devices – would not exist without our modern understanding of quantum mechanics. It’s just… none of it… feels real. I simply refuse to believe in such strange, unintuitive physics that I’ve never physically experienced.

Well, I’ve never directly experienced it, anyway. Sure, I’ve seen demonstrations of the photoelectric effect and the double-slit experiment (which prove that light is fundamentally quantum mechanical). And I suppose every chemical reaction in my body keeping me alive is technically a quantum process. But those don’t count! What I really want to see is something like a person falling through the floor (via quantum tunneling) or just straight-up teleportation. You know, the cool stuff you see in sci-fi movies and expect to learn at MIT (but never do because it’s not real).

At this point, I’m somewhat convinced that quantum mechanics is just a very elaborate inside joke that physicists made up a century ago to confuse everyone else. What do you mean an electron is “like a ball that’s spinning, but it’s not actually a ball, and it’s not actually spinning”? How could it possibly be true that electrons “don’t actually move from point A to point B but instead just spontaneously appear at point B sometimes”? Truly statements dreamed up by the utterly deranged.

And don’t even get me started on quantum “computers”. I bet you’ve never seen one in real life. But I have, and it was basically just a big metal cylinder with a cluster of tubes running out of it. Nothing like the sleek and elegant computer you’re probably reading this on right now.

“Haha, that’s a real scary-looking trash can you guys have there.”

“Actually, Andi, that’s MIT Lincoln Lab’s quantum computer.”

“Yeah, sure it is. What’s next, that shoebox on the table is also a quantum computer?”

“…”

However, all this skepticism ends this semester. It is now 2025 – the 100th anniversary of modern quantum mechanics – and the stars have aligned in every way possible for me to take a quantum engineering class and get over my non-belief.

Quantum engineering classes didn’t even exist at MIT when I was a freshman, but these days, we have 6.2410 (Quantum Systems Engineering Laboratory). 6.2410 is a lab-based class where we build physical quantum sensors out of lasers and stuff, and it is exactly what I need to convince myself that quantum physics is real.

I found out about 6.2410 a year ago because one of the professors saw me working on a project for a completely unrelated class and decided (very serendipitously) to invite me on a tour of the lab with all the equipment. (I must add that I did not know this professor, and this interaction happened at ~7 AM, so it was very much like being visited by a fae.) It was too late to add the class at that point in the semester, but that lab tour was what first got me curious about quantum engineering.

After that, I didn’t think much more about quantum engineering until about two months ago. But that’s when the stars really started to align.

First, Google announced its Willow quantum chip in December, demonstrating useful error correction for the first time ever in a quantum system. It just so happened that Professor Will Oliver – one of the researchers who worked on Willow – teaches a different quantum engineering class in the spring.

Next, when planning my classes for this semester, both quantum engineering classes conveniently fit right in between the few classes I needed to take. And – surprise, surprise – the non-quantum alternatives did not fit at all.

Finally, at the end of IAP (a week ago), I participated in iQuHack (MIT’s quantum computing hackathon) out of boredom and curiosity. Despite only having taken 
        Course 3’s
      
 introductory quantum mechanics class, I somehow still ended up winning one of the categories.

At this point, I knew what I had to do. Heck, my last name is literally “Qu”! The universe was almost begging me to take those quantum engineering classes.

Anyway, all this is to say that I’m taking those classes now, and it’ll be an awesome time. I probably won’t be able to build a fully functional quantum chip like Willow by the end of the semester, but I’ll definitely try to get close.

GELcamp,Emiko P. '25,5,2025-02-06T00:00:00-05:00,"A few days ago I got back from what I can only describe as a four-day fever dream. Here’s a diary of everything that went down during GELcamp…

Day One

Hello! I am currently typing this in 14 degree weather, snuggled up in a remote New Hampshire cabin with 40-ish people from MIT and Wellesley. Today was our first day of GELcamp (more formally known as Camp Cody, and even more formally known as 6.9140: Project Engineering Management), an intense four-day course for students in the Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership (GEL) program. 

For those of you that don’t know, GEL is a program that teaches MIT and Wellesley engineering students a leadership curriculum through weekly lectures and weekly hands-on labs over the course of an entire year. I was a GEL1 my junior year, and I am now continuing the program as a GEL2 during my senior year, where I help mentor and coordinate the GEL1s. Check out their website to learn more!

Our journey to GELcamp started with a two-hour bus-ride from campus to New Hampshire, where we arrived at the snowy front gate of Camp Cody. I wasn’t expecting much, so I was surprised to be greeted by a cozy summer camp with dozens of little green cabins and a ginormous iced-over lake.

After tossing our bags in the cabin and claiming our bunks, we headed straight to our first class. There are a total of eight lectures taught in this project management course (each being 1.5 hours long), and the first two were called: 1) Strategy, Charters, & Targets and 2) History of Project Management, Intro to Scheduling, Critical Path Method. I’ve been more and more interested in leadership and maybe even running my own company one day, so the main thing I want to get out of this course is concrete project management tools and strategies that I can implement in the future. Only two lectures in, and I was already given a few tangible ideas.

Dinner was held in the main cabin with a roaring fire, and I felt like I had been transported back to summer camp at Camp Lakewood in 5th grade. But instead of being like 10 years old, I was a 21-year-old supposedly full-fledged adult, and instead of being forced to eat spaghetti with no utensils, there was a taco and churros buffet that surprisingly hit the spot.

We then transitioned to our group project that we will be working on these next four days. I was assigned to the Blue Team, and our project was to design and build a solar farm to help offset MIT’s carbon emissions! Half the time we worked on the project charter, and the other half we were 
        watching various Blue Man group videos.
      


And that was the first day!! It’s lights out in two minutes, so I’ll see you tomorrow :)

Day Two

Hi, there! It’s Day Two of GELcamp and I feel like I’ve lived two whole days today. We got up bright and early at 7 am for breakfast, and we had class from 8 am until noon. We covered three different lectures: 1) Project Elements: Scope, Activities, 2) Project Organizations, Teams, Allocations, and 3) Project Architecture: Dependence, Breakdown Structures. We learned a lot, but by the end of the fourth hour of lectures, we definitely needed a change of scenery – so that’s what happened!

After grabbing lunch, there was a four hour break, and about 20 of us headed off to the local ski resort to ski, snowboard, and snowshoe! I went skiing, and our little crew ranged from a legit professional speed-skier to legit first-timers. One of the first-timers was Joel S. ’25. Not only is Joel learning about 18 different project management tools over the course of four days, but he also went down a black diamond on his very first day of skiing! Talk about drinking from the firehouse. After one wipeout where he practically slid down the entire mountain face, skis and poles left behind in the dust, I asked him how he was feeling. I got the most enthusiastic “I am great!” I’ve ever heard. I think this ski trip will probably be one of my favorite moments of GELcamp.

I was pretty pooped from our ski day, but it was back to the grind. We had one more lecture called Design of Projects; Canonical Patterns, as well as a class-wide case study and discussion. We then did some more team work on our solar farm project, and then it was night night!

Day Three

Day three! Today was super busy so I’m writing this before bed! It is 1 in the morning! I am so sleep deprived! This is going to be a short rundown of the day. 
        Two lectures
      
 in the morning. Now 8/8 lectures finished. Then panel with industry mentors from Google, System Design and Management masters program, etc. Then went to the ski resort again but this time went snow tubing. Set a record for most people (20!!!!) going down the chute at once. Then dinner and build challenge with our small team. Tried to build a bridge. Stressful. Failed. Tragic. Then grinded on group project for final presentation tomorrow. Feeling good about our project but mostly just tired. It is now 1:05 am. Goodnight!

Day Four

Good afternoon! It’s the fourth and final day of GELcamp. I am writing this just after we gave our final presentation in front of the cohort. I thought it went pretty well, but we sadly didn’t receive all the funding we requested for our solar farm. #L. We did, however, receive feedback on how to revise our proposal for the future (basically our timeline for project completion was a bit too ambitious and we needed to add some slack). Also, side note, it was -2 degrees this morning and my nostrils literally froze on the walk to class, so that was a new sensation. At least I was entertained on that walk by Remi, Eva, and Steph (see pics below)!

We packed up our cabin right after lunch, then hopped on the two-hour bus back to MIT. And with that, GELcamp aka Camp Cody aka 6.9140: Project Engineering Management was complete!

GELcamp complete!

I think the two most important things I gained from this experience were: 

1) Fun memories with my GEL cohort. I have to admit – GELcamp has definitely made me closer with my cohort, and I’m honestly glad I went on this trip (even though I cannot say with 100% honesty that it wasn’t hard and at times pretty exhausting). When I first started GEL, I only knew maybe 10% of my classmates, but now after going to this camp and spending the last two years within the learning community, I can now confidently say I have made core memories with at least 80% of the people in my cohort. Also, skiing and snow tubing were SO FUN!

2) Tangible project management tools that I will be comfortable using for my own projects. My personal favorites that I learned were: work breakdown structures, project network graphs, and risk matrices. Also, my favorite in-class exercise was when we had to optimize an example project’s cost and timeline by changing different resource parameters, like the number of people working on different parts of the project.

I swear this wasn’t on purpose, but the timing of this blog is pretty perfect because the 2025 GEL applications for both GEL1 and GEL2 have just opened up for MIT sophomores and juniors. Check that out here! Also, there is a new half semester class called 6.9140 that is being offered this spring, and it is the first ever project management course offered to undergrads at MIT and will teach all the project management skills we just learned at GELcamp.

And with that – thanks for tagging along with me to GELcamp!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-06-at-15.11.55_f3e983c2-800x1067.jpg

real things,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",6,2025-02-05T00:00:00-05:00,"i’ve started collecting cds. i think part of this has come from wanting to return to physical media, things i can hold in my hand and feel the weight of. there’s a distinct lack of permanence when it comes to accessing my favorite pieces of art in digital space.

i flirted with collecting vinyl for a while, but i’ve only ever bought one record. it was queen’s greatest hits and i think either the record was warped (15% likely) or the suitcase record player that daniel bought at a 
        senior sale
      
 was messed up (85% likely) because when we played it, freddie mercury warbled out a drunken rendition of bohemian rhapsody.

after that, i lost interest in vinyls. not because of freddie mercury — they’re just really expensive now. cheapo records in central square has a few cases of $1 records at the entrance, but it’s rare to find any real gems there.

when i was a kid, i had a binder full of cds and dvds and a player that would strap to the passenger seat in our car. i would sit in the backseat and obsessively watch the bee movie (which i got for my birthday in first grade). i liked flipping through things, choosing something, feeding it into the player and watching it boot up on the screen. i liked how tangible it felt.

over winter break, we took a day trip to seattle. it’s about a 2.5 hour drive and we went to pike place market to meet my friend alex, who was there for the holidays, as well as some of chris’s friends.

that was a blast — one of my favorite memories from visiting seattle in summer 2022 was going to pike place and eating a really delicious pastry with marzipan in it. this time, i kept asking alex if we could go to the marzipan place and they had no idea what i was talking about, and i kept saying, “you know, the marzipan place,” and finally we figured out that it was piroshky piroshky.

we ended up in a record store and i was looking at the cd section. we were going on so many long drives over break that i thought it’d be good to listen to some cds instead of spotify — our spotify playlists had lost some of their appeal.

i bought madonna’s 1998 album ray of light, we said goodbye to our friends, and started the drive back. it was cool feeding the cd into the player and hearing the sound filter through the speakers and listening to the album in the order that it was meant to be listened to.

an hour into our drive, we suddenly got a tire pressure warning on the interface. it was dark, around 9 pm. we were in a very rural place in northern washington. and the soundtrack accompanying all this was a series of psychedelic, haunting ambient tracks — a drastic departure from madonna’s usual style.

UMMM…..

not ideal!!!!

after some floundering, we pulled over to a gas station and inflated all the tires to the recommended pressure and were almost ready to get back on the highway before chris noticed a hissing sound coming from the rear left tire. the pressure had gone down 5 psi in two minutes and upon further inspection, we saw a giant nail firmly embedded in it.

so now we were trapped at the gas station. our phone batteries were both under 20%, but we still needed to look up a youtube tutorial on how to change a spare tire.

winter in the pacific northwest is cold and very misty and very foggy. as we stood there, surrounded by tall, looming pine trees, listening to the tinny sound of the mechanic blaring out from my phone, i suddenly understood why people there believe in cryptids.

this is what it looked like in the rearview mirror as we were passing through bellingham. i was ready to see slenderman any second

we figured out how to access the spare tire and all the tools we would need, but neither of us had the strength to get the lugnuts off the tire.

at this point, a random man walked up to us with a donut and a coffee. he asked if we needed any help. we said, “yeah, can you get the lugnuts off this tire?”

so he set his coffee and donut down on the (wet) ground, took our wrench, and loosened the lugnuts for us.

“oh my god,” i said. “can we do anything for you? like buy you a coffee or something?”

he scratched his head. “ehhh, a few bucks would be nice.”

i pulled out my wallet and gave him the $10 i had in there. he accepted it, fetched his donut and coffee, took a bite, and wandered off into the mist.

this was not a very walkable area. it was close to the highway — just road and gas station, no sidewalks, and he just…ambled off. (an actual cryptid???)

after fumbling through the rest of the tutorial, we slowly pulled out of the gas station. madonna started playing again and i immediately hit pause. and because this was a spare tire, it couldn’t go above 50 miles an hour. which was a problem, because we still had about an hour on the highway to go, and we were crawling at a snail’s pace down the right lane as people beeped at us while they passed. we finally got to the border at 11:30 pm, right before it closed, and inched back home.

when we finally parked, i genuinely could not believe we had survived.

and then i went and bought more cds.

the first thing that krazy bob asked me when i walked into his music emporium: “what’s your elevation at sea level?”

bemused, i said, “0 feet?”

“CORRECT!” he gave me a playing card. “you’re the king of the day.”

the store was full of really crazy things, as the name might suggest. i found a lot of really great albums there: everybody else is doing it, so why can’t we? by the cranberries, pisces iscariot by the smashing pumpkins, blondie’s greatest hits, and when we answered a trivia question at the end after checking out, we were allowed to pick out a free gift from the front of the store. actually, we didn’t even answer the question correctly, but he asked a little girl if we should still get our gift and she decided to spare us. i picked out first band on the moon by the cardigans, which ended up being one of our favorite albums from our trip.

after getting back to boston, i started looking for more places to buy cds. in central square, boomerangs was a beloved thrift store that donated proceeds to hiv and aids resources. it shut down sometime last year and was reopened under a new parent company, more than words. i like their rotating selection of $1 cds to choose from, so i’ve been accumulating more, even though i don’t have a car here in boston or a cd player — though i hope to get the latter soon.

physicality has become a central value in my life. it’s part of why i love knitting and crocheting, because seeing what i make slowly come together with each stitch is immensely rewarding. i can stretch and manipulate the fabric i’ve created, and manifest almost anything i can imagine. it’s almost like 3D printing with yarn.

that same sense of valuing the realness and weight of things is what draws me to labwork. in my urop, it felt like something had perfectly clicked together: i was in the lab learning how to use a platereader, run fluorescent assays, and program a pipetting robot. it all felt so real and i felt right at home.

maybe it’s the fact that when i’m handling physical things like cds or yarn or things in the lab, it’s easier to notice mistakes. maybe i stitched too much when i should have only done one stitch or there’s a giant nail in my tire that i have to fix or my cells aren’t growing. the process of tackling these problems and fixing them feels so natural to me and i learn better from making these sorts of mistakes. with every row of knitting, i’m better at maintaining the tension that i hold the yarn with, and i’m better at keeping track of how many stitches i need to make with a certain color. once, i accidentally left a box of antibiotics out to thaw overnight and i had to remake all of it. that’s something i learned from pretty quickly. i’m a better scientist for it.

when i make bigger mistakes that seem like there’s no coming back from, making smaller ones has given me the resilience i need to get past them.

i recently started attending a weekly fiber arts circle to meet more people in the boston area. this is part of a conscious effort to take a bigger role in the communities i’m part of. instead of isolating myself, i can open myself up to new experiences and learn from others. it’s been really refreshing going to these sessions and having no idea what these people do for work, only knowing the current project they’re working on, which range from mittens and scarves to intricate sweaters and shawls.

and when i have questions about knitting or grad school or the biotech industry, i know people who i can ask for help. i might feel like things are hopeless sometimes, but there are people who continue to take chances on me and believe in me. that has been a lifeline.

this past year has been such a weird transition phase. i tried some things that didn’t end up being good fits, but through all of that i learned more about myself and my working style. i’ve got some new exciting opportunities in front of me that i look forward to exploring — this semester already feels worlds better than the last.

i don’t feel like a fully fledged adult yet, but if i take it one step at a time, and hold onto the tangible things around me for support, i think i can make it.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/137F60F7-DC72-471A-B037-012FB1AD439B_1_105_c.jpeg

How to Make Money at MIT,Aiden H. '28,9,2025-02-04T00:00:00-05:00,"As someone who is notably not a millionaire, I started working in high school once I turned 16. And while a lot of students at other universities might continue to work off-campus jobs, this is very much not the culture at MIT. Considering that the workload here is commonly referred to with the strength of a firehose, hydrant, or 
        any other painful form of water you can think of,
      
 there wasn’t a realistic way for me to continue to serve 30 hrs/week like I used to. The good news is you don’t have to be an OnlyFans model entrepreneur to have some side hustles at MIT.

Unfortunately, the only blog posts about jobs I could find are both from 2008, and general inflation means that their $8.00/hr sounds borderline illegal.

Consider this a semi-comprehensive list of options at/around MIT to do passively throughout the school year, in the random and subjective order I thought of them/was told about them.

Note #1: I have of course not worked all of the following jobs in my ~6 months here and all benefits/cons are mostly from talking to others or found online. Consider this more a list of opportunities to look into than a review of what jobs are most worth it.

Note #2: As of AY2024-2025, MIT minimum wage for students is $15.00/hr. Unless otherwise specified, assume all directly MIT-associated jobs to be at this rate.

 


        UROP
      
/ELO

The go-to 
        MIT
      
 work experience. There are a lot of blogs on UROPs already, so I won’t beat anyone over the head with it too hard, but their importance to the MIT experience can’t really be understated. It’s research at the top research university.

UROPs are technically a part of a larger 
        ELO
      
 program, but UROPS are the most common as they tend to be more accessible, known about, and specialized to major. Other ELO options include teaching/learning programs where students can teach students or gain internships that are not typically research-based (because then it would actually be UROP, but like same diff it doesn’t change what you would actually do per project).

UROPs are super common and have a lot of resources behind them (hence, the UROP office). This makes them an “easier” option to work during the semester, or at least more socially acceptable in a sense. Instead of having to work a random barista job that realistically will not contribute to your future career, UROPs are very educational for both research and industry experience (aka super resume-able).

However, everything depends on the project. Because these are more freelance-hiring style research jobs, trying to decide between multiple projects or knowing who you should work with is difficult, especially if you have a mid-semester major crisis and decide you want to completely switch everything you’re doing. Also, funding is not guaranteed. UROP students have to submit an online application at the start of each term appealing to the school for their project to be funded. Depending on the department the UROP is in, this can range from very possible to extremely unlikely (e.g. 
        CSAIL
      
 has a lot more research funding than, say, 
        DMSE
      
).

Base Pay: $16.00/hr for a max of $2400 a semester (Fall/Spring) or $7680 for summer

More info on UROPs here

 

Dorm Desk Worker

MIT has undergraduate students work the mail desk in the dorms. Students who work desk are allowed and encouraged to work on other things while at the desk, given that when someone needs their package you do your job. Depending on the dorm and term, schedules are either all pick-up (you sign up for as many shifts you want each week when the schedule is released) or a set schedule for all employees is agreed upon at the beginning of the term.

Unlike an intense UROP or off-campus job, no one’s working 10-20 hours a week at the desk. This is a great option for people looking for very passive income so that you have some extra fun-cash lying around. Also considering the workload here, it doesn’t hurt to have a noncommittal role that others are willing and eager to cover for. Also, the ability to do other work makes the commitment a lot less time-consuming. If you’re already sitting at your desk psetting, there’s no reason you shouldn’t sit at a different desk doing the same thing just to get paid for it.

 

Library Desk Worker

This is pretty much the same as above, but the schedules are a little more strict and the tasks are more library/tech-based than grabbing mail.

To my knowledge, the libraries hire at the start of each term, but any open roles can be found here.

 

Blogger

You know this one (it’s this)!!

We write blogs at our own pace through WordPress, have a Slack to ask questions/make casual fun of each other, and meet every other week in the Admissions Office for an official meeting (with INTENSE snacking involved).

In an effort to not seem biased, I shan’t list too many benefits, but there are no complaints.j We have very flexible hours/work. Bloggers are expected to post roughly twice a month, but there are no hard deadlines/angry bosses/lives lost if you push back a post. We post how ever much we want, pretty much whenever we want.

But, being a blogger is competitive, dare I say? Bloggers have to apply and be chosen to join, and this only happens once a year over the summer. It’s great! but not the most immediate/accessible option

Base Pay: $18.00/hr of writing or meeting

Find more about last year’s blogger admissions process here and the experience in this post.

 

Tour Guide

This is pretty self-explanatory, and common across colleges. MIT has some of its undergraduates give tours around campus while sharing their experience and memories, while taking questions.

This is easy because there’s not a lot to learn? You know you’re way around, so the hard part is just making sure everyone follows you. Also everything happens during normal working hours. MIT doesn’t give (official) tours around campus at midnight, so being a tour guide shouldn’t affect your sleep schedule/workload/time to do work at night.

Warning: mild cardio and talking to people is required. Also, this follows USPS rules, so unless the weather is so bad you’ll die, you’re giving that tour in snow/sleet/hail/mild hurricane.

Base Pay: $18.00/hr

Find out more about being a tour guide here.

 

Makerspace/Breakerspace Trainer

MIT has both Makerspaces and Breakerspaces that are run by students for students to, bluntly, make or break things. Students who have already undergone training (among other requirements) are able to train other students and/or monitor the use of the spaces. It’s like lifeguarding, but for science.

Find out more about Makerspace and Breakerspace

 

Tech Caller

Tech Callers are current MIT students who call out on behalf of the school to speak with alumni about their experience and ask for donations to the university. This is meant to serve as a more personal way for MIT to connect with alumni for donations.

Benefits include free food, low flexible hours, and a 
        Severance-styled
      
 rewards system for who raises the most, including everything from shirts to movie tickets to an entire iPad.

Still, you have to call people older than you and ask for money, so there’s all that

Base Pay: $18.00/hr

Find out more about Tech Callers here.

 

Grading

Students whom have previously received an A/A+ in a class might be asked to be a grader for future semesters. It changes depending on the class and professor, but students are given psets/other homework for the class that they can grade according to a provided rubric/answer guide, and then return to the class TA’s within a certain time period.

Fortunately, this isn’t super labor intensive. A lot of graders I know will do it late at night or when they have a spare couple minutes to grade a few psets. The mental strength and effort it not that of a UROP, per se.

Base Pay: $16.00-$18.00/hr depending on the subject.

Find out more about being a 
        math
      
 grader here.

 

TA

Similar to graders, some courses (
        8.01,
      
 
        8.02,
      
 and sometime 
        7.01x
      
 sections) have undergraduate TA’s. For physics, these are students who sit at the tables in the 
        TEAL classroom
      
 with the students as they work to help them with practice problems/answer questions.

Base Pay: $19.00/hr, plus $0.50/hr for each semester

 

Information Systems and Technology

There’s already a whole post about this–read it here!

 

Freelance SWE/Web Dev

This is not MIT-specific, but I’ve heard of a lot of computer science kids being freelanced to make the websites of start-ups/small businesses that maybe don’t have the same web development skills of an MIT student. This is pretty niche and it might be hard to find people, but if you have skills, use them!

 

Run MIT things? (science olympiad, ring premier, tech reunions, etc.)

MIT will often recruit students to run events on campus. These are most often mass-emailed to students, with different jobs for different rates at different times, but looking at the Events Calendar and emailing the organizers is an easy way to find out if they need any paid help for set-up/take-down.

 

Blackboard Cleaning

Some professors (I think 18.03 this semester??) will pay students $10 if they clean all of the whiteboards in 
        10-250 or 26-100
      
 before they start.

Benefits:

- Arm workout

- Easy

- You’re already there

Cons:

- Arm workout

- You have do that in front of everyone as they walk in

- Not a lot of money

- Not consistent

 

Lab Studies

In the middle of so much research, some human subjects are needed. Often individual lab websites will post calls for subjects with different compensation for the project. This is pretty tame, with almost nothing requiring more than an hour or two at a time over some period. If you care about privacy or random side effects, though, approach cautiously? (except no data gets leaked and to my knowledge nothing dangerous is tested on volunteers)

 

Everything Else

Anything else I didn’t mention (random tutor requests, people in the community needed a college student for literally anything) can be found on MIT’s official student job board through Student Financial Services, which you can peruse here.

happy LFDOC!,Emiko P. '25,3,2025-02-03T00:00:00-05:00,"Today marks my last first day of classes (LFDOC!) as an undergrad at MIT. This semester feels particularly special for a number of reasons. Namely: 

- It’s my very last semester (still trying to wrap my head around this)

- I have already completed every requirement to graduate (except the swim test lol)

- For the first time, I have no mandatory soccer requirements

Because of these unique facts, which have not been present in any of my other 7 semesters, this semester is one that I can do whatever I want with. 

So, here are some thoughts swirling in my brain that I want to document, especially because I am lucky to have more-than-the-usual amount of freedom this semester. It’ll be fun to reflect on how I thought it was going to go versus how it actually went when it’s all said and done. Maybe you should also write something like this and reflect when the school year is over!

Blog once a week. This is a crazy goal, but I think it’s achievable because I have a lot more I still want to share with you all.

Try new forms of athletics.

- Yoga. I’ve been getting into this a bit more this IAP. I’ve liked the feeling of stretching my body while simultaneously strengthening it. I want to explore the feeling of exercising without the pressure of pushing myself to be better and better. 

- Dance. I kind of want to try out for Dance Troupe??!! I think DT would be a groovy way to work out.

Soccer. Even though I won’t play another official college soccer game, my time with the team is not over yet. We have many more games of pickup, lifts, and spring scrimmages this semester, and it’s been nice to remember that there is always more soccer to be played :) 

Side quests. I want to explore and embrace spontaneity with my friends, like going to Celtics games, exploring a new part of Beacon Hill, leaving Boston for a little weekend trip in New York or New Hampshire, getting tickets to a last-minute concert, etc. 

Being present. I keep thinking about the future so dang much. Where will I travel this summer? How will I navigate my 
        life in Japan
      
7 months from now? What do I want my career to look like? It’s good to plant seeds to prepare for those moments and it’s also fun to muse about them, but 
        I want to make sure I enjoy how awesome life is right now!
      


Classes. I have no more requirements to graduate, so I am taking the following classes out of pure interest, which is a luxury I’ve never fully had before!

- 2.679: Electronics for Mechanical Systems II

- 6.9130: Engineering Leadership Lab

- 15.3901: Entrepreneurship 101: Systematic Approach to New Venture Creation

- 16.S090: Introduction to Numerical Analysis

- 21W.766: Writing Fantasy

I’m really looking forward to this last semester – diving into new topics and interests, spending time with my friends, working out in new and old ways, and basically just living it up. Happy LFDOC to my fellow seniors!!! :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-03-at-12.31.36_3cb1e88e-800x1067.jpg

If there’s anything I’ve learned from being here this long, it’s that when the weather turns and the gloom sets in and everything feels cold and bleak, the one thing that helps is to pick your head up, to stop staring at the sidewalk and instead look at the faces that are right there with you. Sometimes that’s all you need.’ — paraphrased from the instructor on the first day of MIT’s pistol class

Sometimes that’s all you need.’

— paraphrased from the instructor on the first day of MIT’s pistol class  


Hi again blog,

I write to you from my plane, which departed Barcelona about two hours ago. I just finished watching “My Old Ass” . Rather than a plot summary , I’ll give you the feeling the movie gave me: as if someone was shaking me by the shoulders, urging me never to take anyone in my life for granted.

Similarly, my brain is swimming in all the wisdom dispensed by the slew of cruft blogs. Reading them, I can’t help but be left with a heightened appreciation for the 4 years I get to have at this school, and particularly for how much the people are what make them.

Catalonia has been very generous to me. Its teenagers, with their patience as I harp on in English about topics they’ve only ever found the words for in Catalan. My host family, with the two mandarins oranges they pack me for work every morning, or even some spare change so i can look forward to a mid-day cappuccino at the vending machine. Even the streets, with work from the minds of Gaudi and Dali offering up an escape from the mundane, giving me pause as I marvel at how anyone could come up with art so beautiful and complex.

Two weeks into teaching in Roses, my fellow GTLer, Supriya , and I found ourselves being send with our students to a hackathon in Barcelona. It feels wrong to admit this as an MIT student, but I had no clue what a hackathon even was, let alone how I could be useful. All we knew is that we would be checking in on the students from our school and offering advice; otherwise, we’d be in for quite a bit of down time.

But, not ten minutes upon arrival, we were asked: “You’re the MIT Students, right? Awesome. How do you feel about controlled chaos?” 

This hackathon was run by MIT’s Edgerton center, as part of an international outreach program called Edventures. Essentially, the event is 100 high school students teaming up for a three day sprint to ideate, prototype, and present an invention of their choice. And when I say of their choice, I mean really, entirely of their choice. One group presented an extreme affinity for chairs, another dreamed of creating a solar vehicle, yet another that came up with a masochistic box . The mission was to convey the sense that the sky was the limit: that any progress made within three days wouldn’t even hold a candle to how far they could get if they committed a month, or, say, a year towards their vision.  

Evidently, an event like this takes a lot of care and coordination to put together. One of the coolest things was seeing that local participants from previous years would come back to serve as mentors or distribute materials, helping share part of the effort. The more hands on deck, the better. Learning this, I should’ve known that showing up in my MIT MechE merch would invite some conversation.

So I confirmed that I was, indeed, down to be thrown directly into the fire— thus launching what I call my GTL x Edgerton Center crossover episode. Supriya and I integrated ourselves as best we could into the team— already a very well oiled machine. Before long, we were committing to earlier wakeup times, telling our school that we’d be staying on site later. A year before, I was a prospective Course 20
 who had barely even touched a tool. Now, I was spending an entire day overseeing the mechanical room, equipped with a fanny pack of exacto knives and troubleshooting construction errors. Every time I had the opportunity to help out, I found myself wanting to do so without hesitation. Despite having zero obligation to, I happily embraced the chaos. But why?

Honestly, I fully believe it was the energy of the Edventures team: from the conversations I had with them to the love I could tell they held towards their project, towards each other. In Spain, my life got the chance to intersect with people I never would have met otherwise. While I knew this would happen with my host family, I didn’t expect this sort of thing to happen with people from my very own school. As small as people like to say MIT is, there’s a lot of people— particularly beyond your course number or your living community— that you may never cross paths with. I’m glad that, this time around, I chose to embrace it.

The night of the last day, the team decided to celebrate together.

“Que causalidad— or how do you say it in English?”

“What a coincidence, isn’t it?”

“No, no, that’s casualidad. I mean causalidad. It happened for a reason.”",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-3.04.22%E2%80%AFPM-400x224.png,1
Where the Free Things Are,Richard O. '28,3,2025-01-30T00:00:00-05:00,"Being able to experience new things is such a fundamental part of growing up and with the increasing interconnectedness of our world, it’s now easier than ever to share new information with others. But despite this, there are so many barriers that make finding learning opportunities difficult for those who may not even realize the immense potential of resources out there. Whether it be costs, school funding, or even awareness of these opportunities, there are so many things that can limit the use of tools that people can use to explore new things or study different subjects. 

So for a while now, many discussions have been going on within a number of communities for minorities here on campus about ways that we as a school can support those who may not have easy access to the numerous educational opportunities out there. So with the help of many other students from those communities, I’ve put together this blog that details a non-exhaustive list of 100% free opportunities that students can take advantage of as we start the new year. 

But I also want to note that while it might be tempting, trying to overload yourself by doing ALL of these things may not be the best course of action, especially if your goal in doing so is to apply to a school like MIT. As Petey wonderfully notes in his infamous “Applying Sideways” blog, it’s more important that you do things you love when it comes to college applications than trying to do too much of stuff you don’t. And one of my favorite quotes from the blog that resonated with me so much during high school was: 

You should study hard, be nice, and pursue your passion, because then you will have spent high school doing all the right things, and, as a complete side effect, you’ll be cast in the best light possible for competitive college admissions.

You should study hard, be nice, and pursue your passion, because then you will have spent high school doing all the right things, and, as a complete side effect, you’ll be cast in the best light possible for competitive college admissions.

So as you glance through this list, feel free to make a note of tools and opportunities that you feel you might actually enjoy taking advantage of or even opportunities you don’t know anything about but seem exciting to you. Definitely don’t, however, use this as a checklist of things you have to do to get into a college because then you’ve got the wrong idea.

- Link: 5Academy

- Description: Technically this channel should’ve been included with the other YouTube accounts, but I wanted to single it out here because of its focus on ACT prep. This channel pretty much provides reviews for each of the ACT sections, but what I found to be uniquely helpful were the full practice test walk-throughs that, unlike other methods of test practice, can help you develop a sense of how to actually think about and mentally approach a problem on these tests rather than just trying to memorize all the content.

 

Name: CrackSAT, CrackACT, and CrackAP

- Links: SAT Link, ACT Link, AP Link

- Description: Library of live practice tests (and sometimes available PDFs) for the big 3 of testing in the US. A little cluttered with ads but offers helpful questions for each test section that tell you when you get an answer right or wrong with explanations.

List of Fly-In Programs that focus on underrepresented groups

 

 

And of course, there are many things out there that I can’t fit in a single blog post, so while I plan an update to this post sometime in the future, I highly encourage you to keep exploring the internet for opportunities and websites that excite you. Because the internet is huge and there’s always something new (and hopefully free) to be found out there.",,0
the blogs at twenty,Ceri R. '16,10,2025-01-29T00:00:00-05:00,"Last August, the MIT Admissions blogs turned twenty. Over the past week, we (belatedly) celebrated by asking a bunch of former bloggers to come back and blog for us—just like we did for the tenth blogiversary. In case you 
        missed them,

College—and particularly undergrad—is a liminal space, or at least I experienced it that way. You’re immersed in a fragment of the world that’s constructed to help you become yourself for four(ish) years, before you stumble into whatever’s next and continue, well, becoming. The MIT Admissions blogs are a special corner of the internet because, for over twenty years now, they’ve allowed everyone to peer into the lives of MIT students who have 
        decided to share their journeys of becoming.
      
 And after bloggers receive their diplomas alongside their peers and take that next step…they 
        log off.
      


What I have loved about reading these posts—and I have truly loved them, and all that I have learned about other bloggers and myself this past week—is that they are intergenerational in a way that the day-to-day blogs can never be, by the very nature of this four-year university model. These 
        thirty-four bloggers
      
 are all at different points in their lives, pursuing different milestones, and feeling different (though sometimes parallel) big feelings. And the one thing that tethers 
        them
      
 all is being a blogger for MIT.

I am 
        too tired
      
 to do any sort of quantitative analysis of the blogs beyond counting these thirty-four recent posts. But, qualitatively, I can say that these 20 years of blogs have fostered a community unlike any other I have experienced in person or online.

When we first sent out the email inviting alums to blog, I genuinely wasn’t sure of the response we’d get. It’s a cold email in the middle of January and the social internet looks vastly different than it did one, five, ten…much less twenty years ago. A couple people responded; we sent out a bump; a couple more said they’d try to write something. My secret mental goal was to try and get at least seven posts, so we could have one for each day of the week of the challenge.

But as we started posting, more bloggers reached out and offered to write something. Still more chimed in with a “hello” over email, even though they didn’t feel like writing publicly for one reason or another. I ended up posting three or four tremendously thoughtful blogs a day, and felt guilty as soon as they spilled over onto the second page of the blog archives—and then the third. Every writer needs a different kind of activation energy, but somehow this inspiration fanned outward, enveloping more and more bloggers and imbuing them with a spark. Even if we have never met in person, or never read each others’ writing at length before, the creativity seemed to energize everyone—even the current bloggers, who were asked to hold off on posting until this challenge was over.

Maybe it only felt this magical to those of us in the greater blogger community. Maybe it felt like a warm hug to you all, too. I don’t know if the distinction particularly matters, because I know what it felt like to me, and isn’t that enough?

Petey ended his 2014 post with some musings about the future, and as a former CMS major, I feel compelled to leave my own time capsule, too.

Suffice to say that, in 2004, there were barely any social network sites as we know them today, and so a college admissions site with a) student-written blogs and b) open comments was a kind of godsend for those who might want to get a sense of what life was like at that particular campus. In 2014, those conversations and connections are overwhelmingly occurring through a few social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, etc); instead of being centralized around and facilitated by a given institution, they are facilitated by those channels and decentralized to friends and peers. And, frankly, our bloggers post a lot more to Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and so on than they do to the blogs, because that’s where their friends are.

In 2025, the social media channels feel even more fractured than before. Sure, the prevalence of platforms like Instagram and TikTok can’t be ignored, but conversations and connections are occurring through newsletters (or Patreons and other semi-to-completely-paywalled platforms), Discord servers, and even more decentralized spaces. Our bloggers are carefully distancing themselves from performative posting, regardless of the platform, and they’re thinking about the ways their attention is fractured online.

Fewer people are commenting on the MIT Admissions blogs than the heyday of 2004, but the blogs are still here to greet prospective applicants who are looking to learn more about what their lives could become here. Are there conversations happening elsewhere? Almost certainly, with the ever-increasing stress around college applications. Are those conversations engaging with the nuance of any school being a place where you could become yourself, or the nebulous nature of young adulthood? Maybe not as much as they could be, if all students read these blogs instead of worrying within their echo chambers. But what do I know?!

I know that we’re still missing ways to reach incredibly kind and passionate students who have never heard of MIT before, and that our office is working very hard to help these students understand what MIT is and feel like they could belong here. I know that with Petey as the Director of Communications and Special Projects, whatever strategies come next will center community, student wellbeing, and joyful play, because those are the kinds of spaces he works so hard to curate, and that he curates so well. I know that the Class of 2029 will come to MIT (or go to any number of other colleges) and learn, and grow, and stumble, and change their worlds in little ways—which, as I get older, I think is the key to changing The World in not-so-little ways.

Thank you to everyone who has read, or written, or commented on these blogs. Onward to the next 20 years!",,0

“My name is Paige, and I’m a bit of an optimist. Or at least, I try to be. … Beyond being an optimist, I’m a mathematician. Or at least, I try to be.”


– my blogger bio, circa summer 2023

In one of the very few blog posts I wrote before MIT, I wrote:

I am good at math.

I was terrified of putting this thought out into the world. Hell, I followed the sentence up with a number of caveats all to the effect of: Yes, I do know there are people who are immensely better than I am at math in every possible category of “betterness.” (Does such an objective ranking of “betterness” exist? Would such a ranking even be useful for any real purpose? I don’t think so, though this isn’t the point; I wrote it when I was 17. I digress.) But regardless, I typed the thought, hit post, and put it out into the world.

I am good at math.

When I read this sentence now, I wonder what value, if any, such a statement has. I’ve discussed this blogpost idea with a number of other mathematics graduate students, nearly all of whom agree: making such a statement isn’t wrong, but they would never say it themselves. At this point in my life, I think I agree. When I try to be as objective as I can (a lost cause, as a subjective being), the sentence just feels… braggy. Unhelpful. Unnecessary.

Unnecessary? Yes. No good can come from putting Such a thought Out into the world. Is that true? I think so. 
Nearly every time I’ve heard this phrase, 
it’s been from someone trying to make others 
feel bad about themselves. Then why did you post it all those years ago? …


Unnecessary?

Yes. No good can come from putting Such a thought Out into the world.

Is that true?

I think so. 
Nearly every time I’ve heard this phrase, 
it’s been from someone trying to make others 
feel bad about themselves.

Then why did you post it all those years ago?

…

Listen, I didn’t believe that sentence was true when I made that blog post 5 years ago. When I was 17, all I knew was that I didn’t know anything. I didn’t know what college would be like. I didn’t know if I was prepared for how hard MIT would be. I didn’t know if I could even remotely be someone good at math.

But I knew that I wanted to be. I wanted to have this utter confidence to walk into my first class and sit in the front row like the nerd I am. I wanted to not carry this fear of being seen as dumb in homework sessions. I wanted to believe that I was someone who could feel good at something.

In this way, I wrote out the sentence

I am good at math

not as a declaration, but an affirmation.

At 17, I didn’t know much, but I knew MIT would be really hard. I also knew that MIT would only get harder if I didn’t believe in myself. If I didn’t let myself try my best for fear of failing. If I didn’t let myself be seen as dumb in homework sessions. So… I faked it.

And would you say that was “unnecessary?” Listen, I don’t love your tone Mr. Italics. …
But no, I wouldn’t say that was “unnecessary.” In fact, I found that “faking it” worked.


And would you say that was “unnecessary?”

Listen, I don’t love your tone Mr. Italics. …
But no, I wouldn’t say that was “unnecessary.” In fact, I found that “faking it” worked.

a) My first year I went straight into my meeting with my academic advisor and (essentially) said “These are the classes I want to take. I think I have the prerequisites. It’ll be hard, but I want to try. Give me a shot and you’ll see—I will try my goddamn best.” And there was a moment when, frankly, I didn’t know how he’d respond. There was some part of me that thought he’d turn around and say “That sounds absurd, take these classes instead” or “Who do you think you’re kidding” or something to that effect. But he didn’t. 

He gave me a shot, approved my classes, and (essentially) said

Give it your best.

At the end of that semester, I went back to him with grades I was proud of, and a new absurd class schedule to attempt in the spring. He later became my academic advisor for the rest of undergrad, and he even wrote one of my letters of recommendation to graduate school.

b) That fear of being seen as dumb? Well, that went straight out the window when I went to my first office hour and terribly mispronounced a mathematician’s name to the professor (Dirichlet, if you’re interested—the mathematician whose name I butchered, not the professor). From that point on, I just stopped caring about making a fool of myself. I just… decided to accept that the best learning happens when you open yourself up to the opportunity of being seen as an idiot.

And, much to my shock, I made friends in that process.

My 
        PSET
      
 group and I made a pact: if we spent an hour or two before office hours carefully refining our “foolish” questions into something reasonable to ask an MIT professor, I’d volunteer to ask whatever questions emerged. What resulted was a series of office hours, week after week, of my friends and I going and asking the questions we needed to ask to learn the material and pass the class.

What’s shocking about this to me, is that this just felt right. I knew how I learned best (e.g. asking potentially dumb questions in office hours), and others responded well to that. I was able to exist in this space in a way that I needed to. In a way that best supported my mental health, and gave me the opportunity to learn and get better at math. In a way that allowed me to be me. I guess I was just shocked that this wasn’t seen as a foolish, isolating, endeavor.

Hell, I made friends in that process. Friends who learned that we liked/didn’t like pure math together. Friends who were open to conversations about pedagogy and education and mathematical communication. Friends who lifted each other up; who made each other feel like we were, or at the very least could be, 

Good at math.

That wasn’t easy to find, but “faking it” sure helped.

I clung to that affirmation whenever I found myself struggling in my classes. I’d tell myself– my classmates– my friends: “Right now you’re learning something new, and that’s hard to do, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it.”

I used that affirmation to push back against toxic norms in math. When someone would say that a question was “easy” or “trivial” or “obvious” I’d respond: “Well clearly it’s not, because someone’s asking the question in the first place. And even if there is a simple explanation, that’d be a better response than calling the question ‘easy.’”

I needed that affirmation to make it through MIT. So no, I guess I wouldn’t (subjectively) say that it was “unnecessary.”

What about now? What do you mean? You’re not 17 anymore. You’re 22. Hell, you’re in grad school Hell, you’re gonna be a math PhD student at MIT in less than 8 months. And sure, you don’t have shit figured out, but Does it feel unnecessary for you now? …
Objectively- Stop trying to be objective, it’s a lost cause- Yeah, I don’t think I need the affirmation anymore. I mean, what good does it do? At this point …
At this point, Everyone knows that everyone’s just trying their best. Shouldn’t that be enough? I don’t know, Is that enough? …
No. It doesn’t feel like it. …


What about now?

What do you mean?

You’re not 17 anymore. You’re 22. Hell, you’re in grad school Hell, you’re gonna be a math PhD student at MIT in less than 8 months. And sure, you don’t have shit figured out, but Does it feel unnecessary for you now?

… Objectively-

Stop trying to be objective, it’s a lost cause-

Yeah, I don’t think I need the affirmation anymore. I mean, what good does it do? At this point …
At this point, Everyone knows that everyone’s just trying their best. Shouldn’t that be enough?

I don’t know, Is that enough?

… No. It doesn’t feel like it. …

For one thing, it feels lonely as hell. Sure, idealistically, everyone should just know that everyone’s just trying their best. But that doesn’t inherently stop the feelings of inadequacy, either due to internal or external reasons. That doesn’t magically create the space you need to exist in the ways you need to exist. That doesn’t stop you from constantly asking yourself if you’re even remotely good at this.

Sometimes it just feels like people are taking chances on me, and I don’t know why. At what point in high school was I able to convince someone that I should be admitted to MIT? At what point in undergrad did I become someone who could get paid to research pure math? At what point did I stop faking it? Did I ever?

And these questions just repeat in a loop in my brain. Sometimes, it feels like the loop never stops. But sometimes, there’s a brief silence. A glimpse of clarity. A moment of feeling like I could be a goddamn mathematician.

Not because I resolved some massive open problem, or because I feel like an Expert™ in some topic. Not because I feel like I am

Good at math,

but because I can feel small ways in which, by “faking it,” 

I’ve gotten better.

The moments when I needed that affirmation in undergrad were often associated with questions of sustainability. Moments where I couldn’t help but feel like “Listen, I know that learning new things is hard, but at what point is it too hard? Am I trying too hard? At what point does it get easier? Does it ever?” But I held out hope that one day things, perhaps small and insignificant things, would feel easier.

It wasn’t easy to hold out hope. I felt like I was being too optimistic—too naive—to know better. As if, I was too young to understand just how brutal mathematics can be. As if, I was lying to myself by using idealistic pedagogical beliefs along the lines of “Practice makes better.” As if, it was an inescapable fact of the world that life was meant to always be exactly this hard, and that no one else felt the same.

But, as I said, there have been brief moments where I don’t feel this way. Where, for a moment, my optimism doesn’t feel like blatant naivety.

Like, this last summer when I worked at MathROOTS for the first time (a mathematics summer camp run by MIT’s math department for high schoolers). At this camp, there were moments where I just knew how to exist within this (mentorship? educational? social?) space. Where years and years of being interested in education and thinking about math communication came to fruition.

I don’t want to go terribly into the weeds with the dozen or so moments that made me feel this way at the camp, but I will give one specific mundane example. There was one night where another mentor and I were giving feedback on the practice problems students had turned in. After you finish giving feedback, you’re supposed to put the papers in alphabetical order. And my friend, an amazing colleague and educator, started going through the papers one at a time to do so. Looking for papers with a last name starting with A… then with B… and so on. And I have spent years alphabetizing papers for teachers—hell, I used to do so in my second grade class during recess. So, I politely asked my friend for the papers, and quickly alphabetized them in one hand (if you’re interested, using an insertion sort algorithm).

And it’s dumb. This moment shouldn’t matter. And yet, I couldn’t drop this feeling of just utter exhilaration. Like, it was something I was good at, or at the very least it was something I had gotten better at.

After the exhilaration wore off, my first thought was: I am good at this.

This was immediately followed-up with: You shouldn’t think such things. You shouldn’t think such things because it makes you an ass. You shouldn’t think such things because it’s important to be humble. You shouldn’t think such things because it’s taboo. You should just be happy that you are trying your best, and everyone knows that everyone is just trying their best, so such thoughts shouldn’t be thought in the first place.

So is it enough? No, it’s not. That’s not how my brain works. I try to find moments of happiness when and where I can. To ignore such moments of utter glee “because it’s taboo”… It’s invalidating. You worked hard. You’ve gotten better. You didn’t think you ever would. Did I really? Did I really think That things would never get better? That I could never get better? Constantly. Okay, but now I know that isn’t true. Objectively- I swear to god- Objectively, I know this isn’t true anymore. Shouldn’t that be enough? I don’t know. Is that enough? …
No. …
Why isn’t it enough?

I’ve thought this time and time again since I’ve started graduate school. And let me be clear, I have loved graduate school so far. But I would be remiss to point out that it has taken work to love graduate school. I have three amazing advisors, all of whom care deeply about education and mentorship and beautiful mathematics. Hell, if they didn’t, I wouldn’t want to be their student. Hell, if I didn’t care deeply about those things either, I don’t know if they’d even want me to be their student.

But because I care about those things, I know what I need to be able to exist in this space in the ways that I need to. I know, at least somewhat, how I like to learn, and collaborate, and exist. And yet, when I started graduate school, I thought that I’d have to throw all that out the window.

When I imagined what graduate school would be like, I pictured reading papers til the sun rises. I imagined attempting to solve problem after problem only to be told that such exercises were “trivial.” I thought I’d have to take on toxic mindsets regarding math I had long since dismissed because they didn’t make me happy.

And I won’t go so far as to say that this isn’t some people’s graduate school experience. I am certain there are mentorship horror stories echoed by thousands of students from around the world. But I knew that I didn’t want that. I didn’t want to passively take on the role of “hardened and unfeeling and purely objective mathematician” (a role, thatI am nearly certain, doesn’t exist in actuality).

But it’s hard to dismiss this nagging feeling that, at times, such a role would be easier. 

Would it be? Wouldn’t it be? Wouldn’t it just be easier To always do what others want you to do? To work until you can work no longer? Isn’t that what graduate advisors want? Do you really think that? Is that how you’d advise your students? Is that a mindset you’d encourage? Is that the world you want to live in? No. Then why would you think that’s the world Your advisors want for you? …
Why would you even want to be “a good” Mathematician, Educator, Friend, In a hypothetical world So unchanging, So static, So unfeeling, So… hard? I wouldn’t want to be! That’s the whole point! I have to feel like the world isn’t static, I have to believe That optimism isn’t the same as being naive. I have to believe that all this work was for something. What if, The “something” this work was for, Was to be a practicing optimist? To be someone who thinks that The world can change? Someone who believes that People are worth changing for? …

…

Last semester, I put in a lot of work into learning to love graduate school. To learn that it was okay for me to exist in this space in the ways that I most need to. Which meant, talking to my advisors about such questions. Giving them the opportunity to prove me wrong. To prove that it’s not naive to have such conflicting feelings about the road of academia I chose to go down. And, to my (perhaps, in this way, naive) surprise, they did prove me wrong. 

I told them how, sometimes, it feels like I’m hurting my career in moments where I focus on my mental health. In moments where I prioritize advocacy and education work. In moments where I put myself first. To which they (essentially) said “Is it really hurting your career to do what you need to do? To put energy into the things you care about? To exist in the ways you need to exist?” And, for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel so naive. 

In one of the few blog posts I make before I return to MIT, I will type the thought, hit post, and put it out into the world.

I am not naive.

Do you really believe that? I don’t know. I know that I want to. But I am 22, And while I don’t know much, I know MIT will be really hard. And it’ll only be made harder if I believe otherwise. Are you scared to return to MIT? No. I’m not. Or at least, I don’t want to be. And I think, For now, That has to be enough.

me, circa 2025, looking at the other cruft blog posts

As one of the least crufty of the cruft (for now 😳), I wasn’t too sure what to write about. I don’t have some great life wisdom to share or huge post-MIT takeaways. Or career pivots, self-discovery in a new hobby, or newfound interest in underwater basket weaving. I’m pretty similar to myself at graduation other than some variance in my Spotify playlists, experiencing the horrors of apartment hunting, and figuring out how to use a dishwasher. Not entirely certain if I have conceptualized being crufty or an alum for the matter. 
        I last blogged in June,
      
 which has been a while, but considering how many hiatuses I went on as a blogger, it also doesn’t feel like it. 

 

When I was graduating, my emotions revolved in a pretty binary fashion between WOOOOO I’M DONE 🥳 and 
        *crying while packing my boxes*.
      
 Being a bit removed from MIT and having some time to sit back and just think, I’ve been reflecting a bit about undergrad while keeping in mind that hindsight is 20/20. Or whatever my current prescription is since my eyes are very far from perfect. 

 

After spending pretty much all of my conscious years of existence in schooling of some sort, working a job has let me dwell a bit on this. This led to me commuting home one day and making a short list of things I missed about MIT and things I’m happy to be leaving in the past. Honorable mentions included missing having access to MISTI/global opportunities or makerspaces and not missing sharing a bathroom or living in a 115 sq ft brick oven coffin (Macgregor <3). I wound up elaborating on just a few while spilling tea while drinking tea in a tea shop with a friend.



the low barrier of entry to try new things in college (missed)

 

Let’s say I want to learn how to do Pogo sticking for a new, outside-of-work challenge. I could go buy a Pogo stick if I wanted to and learn via YouTube, as one of my friends said when I posed this terrible, terrible hypothetical idea. But chances are, I probably would like to take a class so that I don’t break my neck and suffer an untimely demise. But then a class costs money o__o, and I need to find a place that actually can make a living off Pogo stick classes to offer them to begin with. If I’m a student, and we have a Pogo sticking club, it probably isn’t too difficult to try it out at the beginning of the semester, see if I like Pogo sticking or not, and then continue from that point. 

 

This example is a bit of a hyperbole and idealistic. I don’t think we even have a Pogo sticking group @ MIT, but I wouldn’t be very surprised if we did.  But hopefully, it barely gets the idea across.

 

I miss having pretty easy access to trying new things (whether it be languages, sports, or niche hobbies) and having it require relatively low travel time or monetary cost, along with being easy to find and join. To try out a new hobby as a 
        “working adult,”
      
 it can feel like you have to get some initial equipment/tools and potentially travel far to a place. And then, you might not be certain you actually like x or y. You might be able to find a community that enjoys doing [insert hobby], but that can be hard to find at first in a new city. It’s still worth it in the end to try new things, but I wish I appreciated more the sheer access I had to a ridiculous variety of extracurriculars just a few months ago.



academic stress & work-life balance difficulties (not missed)

 

During undergrad, I often struggled with being able to “rest.” There was always something I could be doing, perhaps even something I should be doing. So my relaxing didn’t feel very relaxing, and it was hard to actually turn my head off. I assume for some people that comes easier (and for others, perhaps harder), but with a nice load of executive dysfunction, I was having the time of my life.

 

Now, working a job, I find that it is way easier to have a semblance of work-life balance and actually feel relaxed doing whatever it may be after I’m done with the workday. I haven’t taken part in too many hobbies since moving to the West Coast in the fall, but when I have, I’ve found more fulfilment in them. I feel that it comes down to two key things for me.

 

First, not living in the same place as I “work” (whether that be studying or working) helps a lot. When moving after MIT, I planned to not live ~too~ close to my office since I wanted to quite literally feel that work-life separation. I do work remotely sometimes, which may defeat the point a bit, but mentally, I still find it a bit helpful. If I lived, let’s say, a 5-minute walk away from the office, I wouldn’t be able to create that same disconnect in my head. I guess this could have somewhat been achieved through not living on campus during undergrad, but I enjoyed living on campus for a lot of other social reasons, so I wouldn’t ultimately change that. If I ever found myself in grad school, I think I might try something similar to what I’m doing now.

 

Second, and arguably more helpful, is having two laptops. One is my personal laptop, which I got in the fall after my previous one bit the dust with 2 days left in my senior spring, and the other is my corporate laptop. Having a work laptop and my personal laptop is an absolute game-changer in creating that distinction in my life. When I’m doing work stuff, I can just do that and not have as many other distractions grabbing my attention. And when I’m doing personal stuff, I don’t have work notifications appearing on my laptop. I just learned by accident ~ a month ago that there is a feature on Windows to create two “desktops,” which might have been helpful to do back as a student. Would I have actually done it, probably not :P



close proximity to friends (missed)

 

The concept of distance from friends changed a lot for me after graduating. What felt far during college, is something I could, in some sense, only dream for now. It was like, oh no, I live in East Campus and you live in Next House, what a tragedyyyy. Sooooo far apart :(. I have to walk a mile…

 

Except now it is like oh I live on the West Coast and you live on the East Coast, what an actual tragedy. I need to go to an airport, catch a flight, and get from the airport to wherever. I miss having rather close proximity to people I was both close friends with and more casual friends with. The fact that people I lived really close to (in retrospect) are now spread out so far is a bit of a surreal concept for me still, even though it has been quite a few months since graduation.

 

Like most people at MIT, I moved away from home for college, but it wasn’t very far for me all things considered, since I lived ~4 hours away on a bus. I was a bit far from my high school friends, but holidays usually brought us back to the same place. Being cross-country from friends who also have families in other cities is definitely a different vibe. If I wanted to take a bus and visit my friends not on the West Coast, I would be likely to need a spine and hip replacement by the time the bus makes it across the country. I don’t think such a bus even exists, though, in theory, I could take Amtrak for like 80 hours.



boston cold temps + wind tunnels (not missed)

 

Boston winters are cold. The winters when I was at MIT weren’t too bad (but I also never spent an IAP on campus between COVID and doing GTLs), but I still didn’t particularly enjoy the temperatures either. Boston also tends to be pretty windy, and it probably also deserves the title of “Windy City” considering it is the only place that has absolutely demolished my umbrella(s). 

 

I currently live in Seattle, and Seattle’s winter is so calm and mild compared to Boston. It isn’t ever really below freezing, it just is a bit gray and rainy sometimes. I don’t really mind that, and I do feel people in the city are a bit dramatic about the doom and gloom. But, it is possible I’m just seeing one of the nicer winters and will swallow my words next year. The fact that there is generally no wind chill, as someone from the East Coast, is also pretty surprising since the temperatures you see are how it actually feels. Compared to seeing 23F on the East Coast and realizing it actually feels like 15F…

 

More widely, I feel similarly about Boston and Seattle as cities. They both aren’t New York, but they have their charm in their own unique ways. I love the greenery here, especially since a lot of the trees as evergreens and keep the winter days a bit more colorful.



can’t go MIA from responsibilities™️(missed)

 

More times than I would like to admit, I woke up for a lecture, questioned the meaning of life, and went back to bed. I then woke up later, a bit more refreshed but still sleepy, and then finally dragged myself to the next class on my schedule. 

 

At the start of every semester, I knew that if I fell into the trap of missing just one lecture of a class, it was bound to snowball into missing a lot more than just one lecture. Especially if the class was before 11am. Unless it was a thing that required mandatory attendance, like a lab or small class, I kept falling victim to this somewhat-easily-avoidable-issue-that-I-probably-should-have-done-better-with. I don’t think the body I had in college was the same that commuted an hour-ish each way to high school every day. 

 

Sometimes, by sheer muscle memory, I nowadays wake up, and I’m like ahhhh I’m not feeling it, I’ma skip today. But then it hits me. I CAN’T. Well, I could if I had no concept of impulse control, but then I would probably be on the express route to getting fired, and for good reason. Unless I was actually sick or on leave. So I drag my uncooperating body out of my warm, comfy bed into the cold, harsh world that awaits it. 

 

Do I miss being able to simply be irresponsible sometimes and make bad decisions like skipping lectures? Yes. Am I proud of it? No… Go to lecture y’all o_o

 

And with that, I return to cruft blogger slumber to ponder on these takeaways some more 🤔","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mv5bnzazywmxymitztc2nc00ymu5lwe1otitmdbinmmwnjfimgu2xkeyxkfq_ujjt-2483798810.jpg

Thoughts from the Dungeon,kellen manning,4,2025-01-28T00:00:00-05:00,"I’ve been stuck in the same dungeon in Metaphor: Refantazio for the last two weeks.  The most frustrating part of this experience is that every time I turn the game on, it’s a new enemy that sends me to my digital maker. Well, that’s not true. The most frustrating part is that I don’t even need to beat this dungeon to finish the game. I could skip the dungeon and fight the final boss in his airship. Then, the credits would roll, and I could move on with my life. But…no. Mentally, I can’t accept that. So, here I am writing this blog instead.

At first, I was going to skip this blogging challenge. It’s been forever since I’ve written a blog for MIT, and I really don’t have much to contribute.  But I saw everyone else doing it, and then there was an email from Ceri in my inbox this afternoon, and I figured this must be easier than what I’m dealing with in Metaphor. Right?

No. I was wrong. This is my fourth attempt at writing something, and the deadline is so close I can feel its 
        icy breath on the nape of my neck
      
. At this point, it’s whatever. I’m finishing something today, and if it’s not the game, then it will be this blog.

So, here I am. Blogging for the first time in three years. A lot has changed on my end. I feel older. You all feel older. Petey has always felt older, so that doesn’t count, and Jeremy is eternally young, so that doesn’t count either.

If I remember correctly, I used to say everyone has their version of MIT. I’m not sure who gave me that saying, but it still holds true. Looking back, my version of MIT was akin to running as fast as I could while trying to come up with as many cool ideas as possible before I hit the finish line. It was fun, and I like to think I’ve been carrying that vibe since I left. I don’t know.

Anyway. Back to the dungeon.

So, in spite of it all, we’re still alive, and we’re still writing. You can’t stop us. I’m fairly convinced that nothing can, except for the sweet and eventual embrace of death that comes for us all. But, at least for now, I’m not too worried about that inevitability.

Some things have changed. CJ lives in New York, where they work for Stainless, a company that helps people who build web applications talk to each other in different programming languages. I live in Seattle now, where I work on power management for Windows. I travel more than I used to, mostly to visit friends who are now spread out across the country. CJ has “maybe gotten into rhythm games,” 
        or something like that.
      


Some things have not. CJ and I still do Mystery Hunt, where we both spent three days last weekend just staring at computer screens trying to solve puzzles for “fun.” Last March, we visited every station on the New York City subway in a 29-hour sequel to our MBTA excursion, which we wrote about but never posted. I still occasionally do musical theatre, and CJ still occasionally square dances.

Certainly, however, time has passed.

When people approach an ending, do they act any differently?

For the past seventeen months I’ve been living in New York City, in a cruft house named LoTaD, short for Land of Trees and Darkness, or Land of Time and Destiny, or Land of Takeout and Delivery, or whatever, depending on who you ask. Our apartment’s first set of residents was me, Brian ’23, Ixa ’23, and Jason ’22. Five months ago, Brian moved out of LoTaD to start a master’s in Oxford, and Victor ’23 moved in to replace him.

Brian and I spent a lot of time hanging out after work. We’d watch Make Some Noise or Fantasy High Junior Year on Dropout, or I’d watch him play MTG Arena, or he’d watch me play 汉字大冒险, or we’d discuss Henkinization, or pro-drop, or adjoint functors. By the time Brian was planning his trip to Oxford, we wanted to watch Never Stop Blowing Up together, but we decided not to start it, because we knew we couldn’t finish it before he left. We made plans for watching the episodes together remotely, over Discord calls, and we juggled time zone differences and work hours, and when he left I didn’t know if those plans would come to fruition. He promised that he’d be back in January.

I started working for my previous company seventeen months ago, after interning there the previous year. By then, some of the people I’d loved working with had left, or were on another team, or were on the other coast, and I knew I’d be interacting with them a lot less. There’s a plea my heart sings: If I ever come back, I hope you’ll still be here. Inside the plea is a fear, the fear of coming back to something I once loved, and seeing all the things I loved about it be gone, or worse, different. Different in an unpredictable way. I’d shaken out the initial thought of I might stay here for a few years, and it became I’ll see if I’ll want to leave.

When I see the possibility of an ending, do I act any differently?

Someone recently asked me what activities I did during my undergrad at MIT. I told them “a lot of musical theatre and student government,” and then I stopped. I tried to remember anything else I’d done, because I knew there was more—I mean, after all, I’d been so busy—but nothing came to mind. This realization, that I had forgotten so many activities which were important to me at another time, hit me hard. I’d forgotten the acapella group I’d spent four years in; the quizbowl tournaments I drove my team to; the late nights I spent reading applications for THINK. I’d forgotten so much, even if it was just a momentary lapse.

Maybe my memory’s just not that good, or maybe impermanence is the norm.

The students I now interview for MIT keep asking me, in one form or another, what I got out of the experience, and I try to tell them, but often I get stuck trying to summarize the unsummarizable. How do you describe something that was your whole life for five years? I did things at MIT I couldn’t have imagined going in, and they changed me in ways that I don’t think I’ll ever really be able to explain. I met so many kind, intelligent people who taught me about computer systems and writing and plant biology and topology, but who also taught me how to be kind, how to lead with care, how to not be afraid when facing difficulties of different shapes,
        how to intentionally and persistently strive to do better.
      
And, in one way or another, I did my best to show other people how to do these things as well.

Sometimes during these interviews, I feel like I’m watching that life through a rearview mirror, receding into the distance, growing hazy. It’s not that I’m stuck in the past—I’ve always liked living life looking forward to something, and I’ve got plenty to look forward to. But there are things that will never be again. 3 AM conversations in the dorm lounge about category theory, or inorganic chemistry, or Modernist poetry; writing vocal arrangements and plays for your friends to perform and see; finding
        fun ways to just waste time with your band as you sit on stage
      
during pit rehearsals: maybe they aren’t impossible, but the opportunities for things shaped like this are fewer and fewer. And, as time moves by, I begin to forget what happened, and I wonder if I’m forgetting what I learned, too.

To put it simply: one chapter has ended, and another one has begun.

The etymology of the word end goes through the Proto-Germanic *andijaz, which means “endpoint (front or back)”. Imagine a timeline split into eras or periods, or perhaps imagine the real numbers partitioned into intervals. Each period has two endpoints, the front and the back. Each endpoint touches two periods, the ones before and after. This is a point–line duality, a change of perspective: it’s our choice to view periods separated by endpoints, or upheavals separated by stability.

I knew Victor well, about as well as I knew Brian, and I looked forward to all the things we’d do together, once he’d moved in. We’d go to the square dances that Geo calls up in Jersey City, and take the LIRR to the Round One in Hicksville to play Sound Voltex or Chunithm, and discuss paper-folding algorithms, and pork floss cake roll, and how bad Next.js is. But was it going to be as fun as the time I spent with Brian? I didn’t know. I had a gut feeling though, a feeling that told me not to worry too much about it, so I didn’t.

Another end: when did I realize I wanted to leave my last job? Was it when I started working on other programming things, and realized I wanted to do other kinds of software development? Was it when I heard about the hundredth customer churning? Was it when more people I knew and liked left the company? Was it when I started idly browsing job descriptions, was it when I submitted applications, was it when I told a few coworkers I was considering leaving, was it when I interviewed, was it when I got an offer?

Up until that moment, nothing was set, everything was revocable, and I hadn’t committed. Yet my attitude to work changed. I started closing some outstanding projects, and writing whatever documentation I felt like people would need. I declined picking up long-term tickets, and I came into the office less and less. The behavior kicked in before I realized I was doing it. And when I noticed, I made an excuse: I was taking two weeks off that summer, so checking out was a good idea anyway, whether I left the company or not. But my muscles knew, knew before I did, that the end was coming. This was the immune system response to prevent me from getting too hurt when I leave, or to prepare me for starting a new job in a few weeks.

I took the offer. I told some teammates. I told my manager, and gave a formal notice. I told my manager’s manager. I told more teammates. I got the email from HR. I filled out some forms, scheduled an exit interview, sent an email to the company, got some Slack messages, added some people on LinkedIn, said where I was going. I went on some goodbye calls, I collected all my things from the office, I shipped my laptop back, and that was it. It was over.

An ending can be as long as you want it to be. Circumstances set boundaries, but they aren’t emotional safeguards, they can’t be. You can leave with your head on backwards and arms tucked in, or you can suffer over the temporary and savor the liminality.

A few weeks later, Victor moved into LoTaD, and I started my new job.

I guess another reason I think about this ending so much is that I never got to say goodbye to MIT in the way I would’ve liked. I finished my master’s over the summer, living alone in
        Sidney-Pacific,
      
doing research all day and sometimes all night, with only a few friends around and just a couple of other distractions. I didn’t finish my thesis until two weeks after I’d moved to Seattle and started my new job, pulling late nights and early mornings to get everything done. In the midst of all this, it was hard to feel like the chapter was actually foreclosed. Maybe it was just on hold, for a while.

This explanation is attractive—after all, those few weeks were very surreal, signing a lease with a roommate from afar without having ever visited the apartment, sitting on a bare mattress in my dorm writing thesis code as movers collected all of my things, showing up to a random office building on the first day still a little bleary-eyed from a late night worksession and unsure about new job etiquette. Yet, I also suspect that true closure is, in some sense, a myth. Endings are never as clear as you’d think, because life is continuous. Who knows whether this is the last time you’ll ever talk to this acquaintance or that one; who knows whether that was the day you forgot their name, or the day before?

When I think about endings, I think about how, in all the productions of musicals I’ve done, I’ve put weeks of effort into doing whatever my part is, and then, in a blink of an eye, whether three or six shows later, it’s gone. It’ll only exist as a memory in the people who happened to be there in that brief and transitory moment, when we agreed to be in a room together, doing or seeing a show. Those endings, too, never feel complete. Those memories, too, will fade. This is just a bigger version of that.

I still keep doing shows, even though they’ll be forgotten, because I enjoy them in the moment, in the process. Because I like putting a smile on people’s faces,
        especially when I don’t have to be on stage myself.
      


Why should any other part of life be any different?

Here’s a confession. All those things I wrote about Brian? Or about leaving my last job? They’re half fiction.

In the trivial sense, my writing can never capture reality, because reality is multidimensional and prose is a restrictive medium. But even if I could perfectly communicate what I want to, there’s a more essential problem: the fallibility of memory. I’m writing this months after those events happened, and I’m not looking at any receipts while doing so.

I see so many things I don’t remember. I see weeks of lived experience collapsed into sentences: “Brian and I spent a lot of time hanging out after work,” or “I started closing outstanding projects, and writing documentation.” I’m reminded of a segment from Matthewmatosis’s Meta Microvideos:

Over time, the past gets more and more compressed, until only the most important points remain. You can think of every classic as a peak on a mountain; the tide keeps rising, drowning out all the lower peaks. As the water gets higher, the average distance between peaks just keeps getting wider. To the casual music listener, most of Mozart’s contemporaries, like Salieri, have drowned, and someday, he might, too.

You can think of every classic as a peak on a mountain; the tide keeps rising, drowning out all the lower peaks. As the water gets higher, the average distance between peaks just keeps getting wider. To the casual music listener, most of Mozart’s contemporaries, like Salieri, have drowned, and someday, he might, too.

I’ve quoted this before. I almost forgot about that.

The time passed, as it always does. Let me collapse my experience then: Victor moved in, and we spent some great time together; I started my new job, and it’s been treating me somewhat well.

It’s January now. Brian came back, as promised, and we did many of the things we used to do together. We watched stuff, played video games, talked math. We did some new things too. Victor, Brian and I went to Flushing to play rhythm games and get dinner. We left unspoken the fact that Brian was only here for a few days, days we, of course, wouldn’t even spend all together, days that would never really be like the days that we had in the past. Now Brian is gone, and he is back in Oxford, and who knows when we’ll see each other again. It’s only been a few days and I can no longer remember everything we did.

I’m in Boston again, and I’m catching up with people. I talk about my new job, and people ask how it’s different from my old one, and the best I can come up with is the things I work on are more interesting. When people ask about what I disliked about my old job, or when I think about my old job, it’s like I’m running my fingers through sand. I know things must’ve not been great; that’s why I left, right? But how much could I trust that, if I can’t remember the evidence to back it up?

A few months ago, I was listening back through the original campaign of The Adventure Zone, a D&D podcast which I don’t listen to much of anymore. I’ve listened through this campaign a number of times since it was first released in 2017, and as I was writing in my journal, a curiosity struck me to check when the last time I’d listened through was. Looking back, I realized it had only been a year ago, just at the start of the MEng. I wrote:

Man, it’s been 400 days since I last listened through…just over a year, just starting the MEng, and yet I feel unrecognizable to myself from then. So much pain has passed between now and then.

Man, it’s been 400 days since I last listened through…just over a year, just starting the MEng, and yet I feel unrecognizable to myself from then. So much pain has passed between now and then.

It was this second thought that was really jarring to me, because it was this sudden indication that I might be measuring the passage of time by “pain incurred.” And, the more I thought about it, the more I realized it might be true. I remember semesters of school by the bad things that happened, by the difficulties I had to overcome, rather than by successes, by accomplishments, by joy, by forward progress. I forget the good things, because once they’ve happened, they become part of who I am, like it’s always been that way. I stop noticing them.

And then I thought, what happens now? It surely can’t be healthy to live forever with pain as a metric of time; to have to struggle and suffer to feel like growth has happened. Surely, now, as life goes on, there must be something else to measure the years by.

I don’t know. I think that’s one of the next questions I’m looking to answer.

A situation can trigger memories of a similar traumatic experience, but it can also trigger memories of a similar wholesome one. MIT’s campus is replete of these delightful reminders, and if I defocused my attention and walked around, I could feel it constantly. The brain doesn’t need to remember everything; the body remembers too. Maybe memory is never cut so cleanly, maybe the details we’ve lost aren’t gone forever, you know?

The Monday after this year’s Mystery Hunt, me and some teammates gathered in a friend’s apartment to play board games. We started at 8 PM, and soon enough the board games stopped, and people moved to sit on the couches and chairs around a coffee table, and talked, for three hours straight. We talked about many things: what people were up to, names, Magic the Gathering, random things people had memorized, square dancing.

Someone later described that whole thing as a dorm-lounge-coded conversation, and that comparison made me pause. It was a dorm-lounge-coded conversation, wasn’t it? One I’ve had hundreds of times in many guises, in the TV Lounge on
        floorpi,
      
one I haven’t had recently. Or maybe, the similar ones I’ve had recently were of different flavors: ones that veered closer to Geoguessr or whatever nonsense the big AI companies are up to. Or maybe, these conversations can only really happen with a critical mass: you need a dozen people, all familiar with each other, all lounging without the pressure of making the most of their time.

I’ll forget about that conversation soon enough. It’ll be a warm patch in the fabric of the past few weeks, and then it’ll be gone. It might be there when I come back, and maybe we’ll trod the same ground again. There are no stakes in having fun. Part of me will remember anyway.

I don’t remember much from reading Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being, but I remember one of its arguments: you only live once, so your actions have no meaning, no weight to pull you down. This is in response to the idea of eternal recurrence, put forward by Nietzsche: you will live your life over and over again, so you better be ready to repeat your actions an infinite number of times. Eternal recurrence isn’t a literal fact, but a hypothetical: if I told you that you had to repeat your life forever, what would you feel? If you were given the chance to do it again, in exactly the same way, would you?

If you gave seventeen-year-old me the choice to live his life all over again, he’d have said no. If you asked me now, I might say yes. Hell, I might be living in eternal recurrence right now. I don’t remember the future, but something in my body tells me that it’ll all be worth it.

Maybe the point is this: you’re always changing, even if it feels like you aren’t. Every new memory, every little thing you do changes you, and you just never notice until one day you wake up and you think “that’s not who I used to be.” Sometimes, even that thought disappears, and instead you think “I must have always been this way.”

When life changes suddenly, it puts you off balance, because it reminds you that change does happen. It reminds you that not everything will be as it was, and ever shall be. And, yes, there will be things you lose: memories, friends, skills, opportunities. But there are also things you will keep—and, most importantly, things you will choose to keep. Values and ideas and memories and people that, after years of becoming yourself, you know are too precious to lose.

It is in this sense that life currently feels urgent and exciting to me, this combing of the past to tell me what is important to my present. It is trying to escape this stuckness, trying to take my eyes from the rearview mirror and move them to the road ahead, without forgetting what is behind me. I am holding on to the steering wheel, because there is still so much to look forward to. I am looking forward, because being terrified that I’ll lose the good parts of who I was only makes them more likely to slip away.

And, indeed, I do some new things now, and I am starting to hold them too. I’ve joined a new choir; I’m playing in a symphony orchestra for the first time in five years. I bought a camera and I’ve
        used it liberally
      
to capture moments that speak to me: a silhouette here, a reflection there; a moving car here, a candid smile there.

I keep realizing that I am genuinely quite happy, even if it feels like nothing matters the way it used to; where I’ve suddenly gone from someone who is always making art and organizing activities to
        someone who works a day job and has hobbies.
      
I know, in the long run, the things I’m making likely won’t be noticed or remembered by anyone, including myself, and maybe that’s okay, so long as it changes me, though that won’t stop me from trying.

I guess I’ve been looking for permanence in a world where nothing is permanent, where even mountains, after months and years, centuries and millennia, ebb away. It is time to learn that nothing gold can stay, and that can be okay.

And so:

- we learn things we’ll have to review,

- we read books and watch movies that we’ll forget,

- we have conversations we’ll repeat over and over,

- we create art that’ll linger in obscurity,

- we go to parties and meet people we’ll never see again,

- we make friends we’ll only see a handful of times,

- we do things even if we’ll forget about them,

because:

- we learn the things faster the next time around,

- we get to experience the joy of first reading or watching,

- we enjoy repeating the conversations anyway,

- we make the art for the sake of making the art,

- we become closer to the kind of person who meets people,

- we are ever-changed by those we hold close,

- we remember, or at least, part of us remembers,

because:

- an ending is never fixed in place,

- a memory is never cut so cleanly,

- the time is never truly lost.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ALANCJONEIMAGE-1000x500.jpg

You always have been,Cami M. '23,8,2025-01-28T00:00:00-05:00,"Dear Reader,

I’m writing this in the WordPress portal and this is an absolute blast from the fucking past. Can I open up by cursing? Is that allowed? One time, in my sophomore year, there was a blogger meeting where I think it was insinuated that content on the blogs was getting maybe somewhat raunchy or vulgar and I cried after the meeting because I thought it was targeted at me. Then, Petey had to message me directly to comfort me and clear things up. Core memory for sure.

Anyway, hi everyone, to those of you who do not know me, my name is Cami and I graduated MIT in 2023. It feels weird and maybe self-serving to say like “You might know me from…” or “I was known for…”, but I’ll fight through it for the sake of the blogposts. I was known on the blogs for having a lot of braindump-type posts that mainly waxed poetic about my time at MIT, both good and bad. My goal was to make it more like journal entries and stamped moments of my life.

I actually look back at my blogs pretty often – then and now, way back then to somewhat then, super way back then to the very current now, etc. I’m always slightly amused seeing what things I was fussing about then, whether it was going through breakups (both freshman and senior year!) or being worried about passing classes or trying to figure out what the future holds.

I look back and read those blogposts and feel just as much as I felt in those moments. The crying, the laughter, the fear – everything. It’s incredibly humbling. As I prepared to write these “cruft” blogs (which Mel so kindly notified me about, thank you Mel), I also dug back into my old MIT email and re-read a lot of the very kind emails readers had sent me through the 4 years I was blogging.

I didn’t quite know what I wanted to write in this blogpost, but I knew to some degree I wanted to give a heartfelt and very full thank you. My senior year, my brain was in a lot of disarray and while I did leave thank you notes, 
        I don’t think they were super complete.
      
 But thank you for all the kind messages over the years and the opportunities and encouragement and just. Everything. Blogging brought me some of the fondest and best memories I made at MIT, best mentors, best friendships, best experiences, just everything. I owe nearly *everything* to my blogging experience here at MIT. Through it, I learned to be more vulnerable and how to word my feelings and really just feel everything I was feeling. I don’t think I realized how much I relied on writing to feel things, and honestly once I graduated college, I stopped writing and found it a lot harder to feel in touch with my emotions.

Anyway, what have I been up to since then?

Where do you live? What do you do? What is life like?

Writing this makes me wish I had written one of those “Letter to yourself 5 years from now” when I graduated. Anyway, I am still in fact in New York City working as a product manager for a big tech company. It’s exactly how it sounds. It’s remote so I have a lot of flexibility in my day to day.

Usually, my work just looks like me outstretched on my couch, tip-tapping away at product requirements or to my teammates asking questions about data, etc. It feels very adult. It’s also odd that people look to me for product direction. I’m actually working on a humongous project that I’m super excited about (and feel extremely privileged to take lead on).

I live in a gorgeous, beautiful apartment which I am also grateful to live in. MIT did a great job of setting me up for success and I feel very good about my lifestyle, my home, my hobbies, etc.

I live with my dog and my boyfriend. Yes! I got a dog. He’s the best thing in the world, even if he’s a pain in my ass.

They’re my whole world and I love them with every surface area available of my body and heart.

Cami? What?

Yeah, a lot has changed since I graduated. I had a weird last semester where I was trying to find myself and boy howdy, I did! Post-grad life has been an absolute blast, it’s been basically everything I wanted and more. Let’s get into it.

NEW YORK

- That’s me and my old roommate, Sirena! I have since moved from this apartment but it was so cute doing the whole girls in a New York City apartment thing. Felt very Friends, Sex and the City-esque.

- My boyfriend and I at Fish Cheeks in Manhattan (not…my favorite Thai place in NYC – that would be Soothr). But, anyone who knows me knows I LOVE eating. I love eating. SO MUCH. And there’s so much variety here and I get to try new, delicious foods all the time.

- Thankfully, NYC has great public transit so I’m able to go to places like upstate New York and see more greenery and do apple picking, like I did when I was in college!

- A lot of MIT people live in New York and there’s always something going on! This was from a New Year’s eve party I went to with my friends.

- A more wholesome moment – board game cafes! Board games have become…such a big part of my life. My boyfriend introduced me to Twilight Imperium and I’ve become obsessed, I cannot believe I’ve become the kind of person who plays 8-12 hour long boardgames.

- My friends and me at the US Open! I love tennis, I love watching tennis, and it is an absolute privilege to have a major so close to me. I’ve seen so many incredible matches (I watched the Tiafoe v. Fritz 2024 match last year and it was literally so breathtaking). Absolutely LOVE tennis, I hope to go to every major and get a (viewing) grand slam of my own.

- I crocheted a Baby Plum from the Binding of Isaac for my boyfriend! I’ve actually found a lot more time since graduating to invest more in my hobbies.

- Broadway! This is a picture of the final bows from the Sweeney Todd revival. SO good. I’ve seen so many Broadway shows since living here (my favorites are Hadestown, Maybe Happy Ending, and Wicked) and I am always so awestruck by all the stars that come out and do plays and musicals out here. Sarah Snook from Succession is actually going to be starring in a Picture of Dorian Gray play here on Broadway. I am elated.

- Special events! Like I said, there’s always some fuckshit going on in NYC. I am always keeping an eye out for pop-ups (like the Timothee Chalamet look alike contest), weird happenings, random events to go to and one of them was the Apple Music Taylor Swift: Artist of the Year event where they had a special pop-up museum-like thing that walked you through all of her eras.

- Cooking! Hosting! This is my cozy wintertime hangout I hosted where I made shakshuka and hot chocolate for my friends.

Living in New York has given me so many unique opportunities and ways to enjoy life. There’s always something going on in the city and I think it really compliments my brain and the way I think. I hop between a lot of different activities and things I want to try and there’s ALWAYS an opportunity to go do and try those things in the city.

TRAVEL

Travel is incredibly important to me. The nice thing about having a fully remote job is that you can really zoom-zoom anywhere and everywhere (with permission, of course). I’ve really made the most of not having to worry about tests or homework or classes and embraced traveling. I think sometimes I travel a bit too much, and it ruins my routine a lot, but I really do feel this urgency to go see things, especially while I still can.

- Emma and I went to Vegas for funsies right after graduation, which was an absolutely crazy fun time.

- I also then returned to Vegas that October for TwitchCon, here’s me with AustinShow and HasanAbi.

- So I think this photo is in London but honestly on this trip my mom, cousin, uncle, and I went to Prague also, so maybe this is in Prague?

- In January 2024 I Went on a Cancun trip with my closest dphie sisters to escape the chilly NYC winter. It was an all-inclusive resort and it was fantastic. I also got to practice my horrible, horrible Spanish.

- I also went to Tokyo the summer right after I graduated and Sirena and Mikey were interning abroad there! So we went to this very delicious izakaya and did karaoke after!

- I recently had the realization that there are so many beautiful things in this world and I may die not having seen them, and so I’ve become more determined to go hiking and see more sights. I’ve been to Yosemite before, but we didn’t do this hike. This was the Vernal Falls + Nevada Falls trail. I was so scared to do this, especially just because I was the least fit in the group, but I was so proud of myself for getting to the top!

- So-Fi Stadium Eras Tour. I actually got to see Taylor perform twice, once here in Los Angeles and another time on her final night of the Eras Tour ever in Vancouver.

- Me with Emma before she embarked for her job abroad. Santa Monica is so close to where we both call home and so this felt more like a return home than a travel trip.

DOMESTICITY & FAMILY

I’ve spent so much of my postgrad life traveling and trying new things and hopping around, but also attempting to be a lot more intentional with my time and how I spend it. I realized I had the income to travel home more often, to see my dad’s side more often, to buy Christmas presents for my family, to go on vacations with my boyfriend and my dog. If you had asked me a year ago what the hardest thing I’ve ever done is, I would’ve said MIT. If you were to ask me that question today, I would say losing my grandmother. I am so grateful for the time I got to spend with her and those last moments. I wrote a whole thing about it on my Substack, and I won’t get into it here, but I really, really have been focusing a lot on building a home, building a family, and maintaining and strengthening my relationship with my family. I’ve tried so hard to cultivate a loving home for my boyfriend, dog, and I and also to fly back home regularly to see my family.

- Me as a baby with my Nona. I love this photo of us.

- This was the very last photo my Nona and I took together. She was hospitalized maybe 24 hours after this was taken. Our last good day together.

- Me and my baby boy Butters! He gets annoyed with me sometimes.

- Butters and his Auntie Kylee together, he loves attention.

- A lot of my “perfect” days in New York are just this: my boyfriend, my dog, and I sat on our comfortable couch doing absolutely nothing.

- My beautiful home!! Okay, it’s a little messy in this photo but this is so cozy. Vibes are immaculate. Lavender candle lit. Virtual fireplace on. Speakers on. Dim lamps. Dog next to me. Perfect.

- Snickers appearance!! Wouldn’t be a Cami blog if I didn’t have the OG dog in here. He’s sick right now, though, please wish him well.

- My grandfather, my Lolo. That’s his spot at the table, he always has to sit there.

- My mama!

- A little decor for the house. We got that Philippines tapestry from an antique store in Hunter, New York. Was kind of crazy to see it.

HOBBIES, WORK, and ME

I don’t really have pictures to represent these, so bear with me. Like I mentioned earlier, postgrad has given me the ability to just invest more – in people, in things I care about, in my hobbies, in myself, and I’m super grateful for it. Since graduating I have been…

- starting (and stopped) guitar lessons. It was great diving into it again and getting formal training since I’ve only been self taught. I’ve since stopped (just because it was hard to balance with my schedule) but I might start piano lessons!

- doing Spanish classes. One of my goals in life is to attain fluency, and so hopefully through this and comprehensible input and lots of practice, I’ll get there.

- Journaling! This is an interesting one. Since I stopped blogging, I realized I stopped processing my emotions and thoughts as deeply. I relied on blogging as a form of handling and understanding my thoughts. My poor therapist. But I’ve started writing/journaling/blogging again to make sure I don’t get emotionally constipated.

- Cooking! I cook a lot, I would say. And I think I’m actually pretty good at it. I no longer get intimidated by the grocery store to figure out what to eat and I actually find cooking quite relaxing.

- Reading and running. This one was a surprise to me, too. I never thought I would ever run in my life. Ever. And then I talked to Petey about how my old gym was too far from my new place but I was locked into a subscription for at least the rest of the year, so he suggested running. To which I scoffed out but then I downloaded Run with Hal and then I ran a 5K in December!!!! When I run, I listen to audiobooks and it’s actually fantastic and has helped me get back into reading a little bit more. I’m currently reading Pachinko!

- Playing games. My boyfriend and I are currently doing a Baldur’s Gate 3 run. I had a Balatro obsession for a little bit (MIND YOU I HAVE BEEN PLAYING SINCE THE DEMO!! I LOVE THAT GAME!) and I learned how to play Civ recently. It’s been great.

- Grinding! I love my job and my co-workers. I think I work a lot, but I think it’s worth it.

- Going to the movies! I have an Alamo Drafthouse subscription so I go to a lot of movies. I highly recommend getting a movie theatre subscription if you have the time to go. Convince your friends, too.

- Going to concerts! If y’all know me, y’all know I love my concerts. It’s actually terrifying because SO much of my money goes to entertainment/shows/concerts/etc….we’ll work on it.

All of this is to say – I’m doing well. There have been a lot of ups and downs postgrad but my family and friends have kept me grounded and stabilized. I wish I could go back in time and give college Cami a big hug. There were so many times where I wondered what life was going to be like, who I was going to be, where I was going to be. New York was daunting and scary. I didn’t know where I was going to live or what I was even doing in there. And now, I’ve really carved out a spot for myself. I still keep in contact with so many of my college friends, and I really believe I’ve worked hard to try and fashion my life into something I’m proud of.

Obviously, I still have so much future ahead of me, and I don’t know what will come next, but I’m happy to be where I stand, and I look forward to whatever lies ahead!!!!

Much love from Butters and I,

Cami","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9906-800x1067.jpeg

infinite corridors,Vincent H. '23,6,2025-01-27T00:00:00-05:00,"in the (almost) two years since leaving school, the term “infinite corridor” has taken on new meanings for me. at mit it refers to a long hallway on campus:



but lately when i think about infinite corridors this is the picture i have in mind:



i was so preoccupied during undergrad with picking the best possible version of myself to become – deciding on where to live and who to spend time with and career choices and so on. i thought the world became less malleable the moment you left school, and you can see the anxiety running strong through all my old blogs. these days i’m still a little anxious, but i’ve also realized things are not as set in stone as i imagined: i’ve already switched jobs and roles, signed a new lease, changed my hair and speaking style and health routines and a million other things. the stakes still feel high, but it’s also true that most actions are reversible and sometimes you just need to live longer and collect more experiences before you can really understand your own preferences

from my spiritual awakening:

i’m not saying your seeking is useless. what i mean is that you’re an unfolding process. your seeking is one beautiful, important part. every day changes us. the things we do, the things we see, the people we meet – these all move our process forward. keep seeking. living bundles the kindling. lightning does strike

at a high level my life is not so different from what it was like during school, though of course all the details have changed

- i still live with a large number of friends, though instead of a dorm with 18-to-22-year-olds in cambridge it’s a house in sf with people moderately older than me

- i still spend most of my time thinking about math and computers – though these days, instead of reading all the papers and writing all the code myself, most of the heavy lifting is done by tools like perplexity and cursor. i used to be quite insecure about this, but nowadays i’m grateful that work is easier than ever

- i still spend a lot of time writing, except on substack instead of the mit admissions blog. i think when i was in school a lot of my blogs could be considered rationality-adjacent (cringe), whereas now i spend less time trying to be rational and more time trying to understand people and feelings. on the whole i prefer the changes; obviously i no longer reach as broad of an audience as before, but more of my friends read my writing now and i get clearer engagement (eg. recently hit 100 likes on a post!). i still avoid capitalization when possible and punctuation at the ends of paragraphs

the second half of 2023 was absolutely brutal. i was reeling from moving to a new city and living in a house with forty old white men (don’t ask how) and a breakup and feeling incompetent at work and missing my friends and feeling unsafe at night. i felt like i’d been caught completely off-guard by life after school and often wondered if i’d squandered all my time in college, if i was being punished now for spending four years having fun instead of preparing for my future problems. by contrast 2024 was the best year of my life so far – i saw lots of friends and an eclipse and ten new states, my boss helped me figure out how to think about feelings and communication more clearly, i learned more about the kinds of work i enjoy, i finally started taking better care of my physical health, and so on

it’s obviously not true that the new year suddenly made me way better at life. i think what is true is that progress often appears to be either nonexistent or explosive because we don’t have precise ways of measuring anything in between, so the little things accumulate undetected over time and then one day you suddenly feel like a different person. not to be a nerd but in my research there’s a notion that as language models get larger they appear to suddenly acquire new skills, but only because we evaluate skills via discontinuous metrics

even when everything sucked in late 2023 there would be glimmers of progress if i paid close attention – little things, like, i would plan an event or navigate a tricky conversation or write a particularly complex piece of code, and then i would look back and think huh, there’s no way i could’ve done that a few years ago. i’m not good at paying attention to small wins yet, but i think it becomes more important once you leave school and aren’t constantly getting feedback (eg. via grades), and i’d like to get there eventually

from the answer is not a hut in the woods:

when i really look back on it the real adventures were someone you know doing something you don’t expect or trying to remember how you fixed yourself after a blue patch and realizing it was largely thanks to someone standing benevolently in the background of your life and doing it quietly from afar without you even realizing it… perhaps the strangest adventure, perhaps the most humbling one, happens on the inside – discovering those parts of yourself you’ve never acknowledged, jettisoning those parts you’ve never liked and constantly, constantly being aware that you will soon turn into someone else and whoever that is is decided at every moment by you now and in two minutes and two minutes after that until 10 years later, after one very long succession of two minutes you find a new you sitting there and you’re not even sure where they began nor where they’ll end",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-19-at-11.07.46-AM-400x254.png,1
Everything is different now,Mimi S. '22,1,2025-01-27T00:00:00-05:00,"The student blogger named Mimi is a much different person than I am now. For better or for worse, everything about me has changed. I want to start with things that have remained the same since I left MIT. My love of music and anime has been constant. I was shocked at how many of my posts were about Jojo and even more shocked that I’m still just as obsessed with it! The manga’s been getting good and I eagerly await Jojo day each month. My last year at MIT, I spent most of it ignoring school work and playing with synthesizers at the Voxel Lab. It’s cute that old Mimi and I both get so obsessed about things and immediately have to share it with as many people as possible. Although, old Mimi tried a bit too hard to be likable in her posts. She’s not quite as funny as I am. I’ve still got the curiosity and drive and desire to learn as old Mimi. I know old Mimi is quite literally just me from a few years ago, but there are so many parts of her that I don’t like anymore. I don’t like that she’s not very confident and has to act like a different person to try to get people to like her.

Before MIT, I struggled within my shell. I was closed off to others, and too afraid to try and break out. Throughout my four years at MIT, I gradually opened up to people, developed some new hobbies, and really opened up. I played music in front of people for the first time in my life (it was a modular synth techno set, if you were curious). Generally speaking, I was trying new things and slowly stepping out of my shell. I had developed a real confidence in my self for the first time in my life.

When I graduated from MIT, I thought I had a golden ticket. I found a really good job, and an apartment in Boston, and I was ready to finally live my life for the first time. Then the apartment situation fell apart, so I moved back home with my parents. I wasn’t happy about it, but I could navigate that situation pretty well. During that time I met my current girlfriend, and moved in with her. I found a fantastic group of people in my home city. People that had been living there for ages, but that I didn’t meet until after MIT. I got really good at pool, wowing strangers at bars mostly. I was having a pretty good year.

I lost my job after about a year. What followed can only be described as spiral and collapse. That was the longest, coldest, and darkest winter of my life. Within three months, all of the confidence I had developed at MIT was destroyed. I entered a cycle of depression and anger. My relationship was falling apart and I was nowhere closing to finding a job in my field. After several months of this cycle, my girlfriend had reached her breaking point with me. I was inconsiderate, angry, and just generally made life difficult for both of us, and she had enough. She told me something had to change. I had to find something to get out of the house, and not be locked away all day. She suggested that I tried out Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes at a local gym. I resisted. “Oh I’m not athletic, I don’t think i’d like it” “oh its probably expensive” “it’s probably going to be pretty bad for me to show up as a transgender woman”. I pulled back as much as I could, but eventually I gave in. I joined their beginner program.

BJJ was basically my life for the next several months, through the summer and fall. I was never good at it (I’m still not) but it give me meaning again. It gave me confidence. I felt dangerous. I started doing Muay Thai and MMA classes at the same gym. I went to a boxing gym for a little bit too, just so I could keep doing training. Now, I’ve started doing weightlifting in addition to my regular training. Doing that martial arts training basically kept me alive during that dark time.

At the same time, my girlfriend and I had slowly been developing a strong network of friends in the area. So now, I was working out, learning new skills, making new friends, and trying new experiences. In the fall, I ended up starting a new job in the restaurant industry. It’s not really what I want to be doing, but I like everyone I work with and I’ve made even more friends from there. My life from one year ago is vastly different than it is now. My life at MIT from three years ago might as well be a different person entirely. I think the most important lesson i’ve learned from this is that I have to remain open to new experiences all the time. I tried so hard to force my life to be what I wanted, and that just wasn’t happening. It lead to self-destructive tendencies, and generally depression. Once I let go, I felt like I start living my life again. I’m still looking for work in my target industry. I’m not giving up on that. But progress is non-linear.

Here’s a quick list of things I’ve done since graduating:

- Worked at an indie game studio

- Became a bit of pool shark (I have a reputation now)

- Grew my synthesizer collection

- Performed multiple local shows

- Started BJJ and Muay Thai training

- Learned to juggle

- Rescued a stray cat (my beautiful son)

Highly recommend reading my Jojopost if you haven’t. It’s amazing unhinged.

I’m Still Here (for now),Sabrina M. '21,1,2025-01-27T00:00:00-05:00,"I’m sitting in the quiet car of a Northeast Regional Amtrak train, writing a blog post for the first time in almost four years. Since I started MIT in the fall of 2015, I’ve taken the trip from New York to Boston more times than I can count, whether by car or bus or plane or train. My parents used to drive me 
        down and back
      
 when I first started college, 17 and still their innocent, perhaps helpless, teenaged child. The years after were filled with long, uncomfortable, sometimes melancholy, sometimes scary trips on the medley of NYC – Boston busses available: the Greyhound bus when I wanted to cut down the final one to three hours that driving into Manhattan added to commute time, the Lucky Star bus to Chinatown when I valued speed over all, the Megabus when I could catch it cheap enough, and any other bus when I was desperate and needed a way back now, with the kind of youthful urgency I could only have when every experience felt so new and every second felt like it would slip away from me, taking the rest of my life with it. For some holidays, my mom would find plane tickets cheap if she bought them almost a year in advance, and for the first time in my life, I learned to fly alone. I’d grip my seatbelt hard for the duration of the forty-minute flight, wishing I could ask the older women sitting next to me to hold my hand through my ever-worsening plane anxiety. We were going to go down as soon as we went up, I was sure of it, but I could only rely on myself to assuage the crushing fear of this knowing. Since the pandemic temporarily tanked Amtrak’s prices and I 
        grew older,
      
 I’ve taken to riding the train whenever I journey back. Its coastal views of the northeast are familiar to me, and its spotty Wi-Fi comforting. I don’t need to white knuckle my way through the slow, relaxed ride along the northeast coast.

I’m listening to a playlist I made in 2016 precisely for this reason: long trips between the two cities I would call home. Over the years I’ve slowly added songs to its seven hour plus runtime, and it is both an ode to the nostalgia of that first year of back and forth travel, but also a time capsule for the different points in my life to come after. There are songs that I’ve 
        cherished since high school,
      
 songs I discovered 
        after graduating MIT,
      
 and songs I once knew and then rediscovered and 
        reimbued with new meaning as I grew older.
      
 Right now, Sufjan Steven’s Chicago is playing through my headphones, and I’m hit with the memory of all these years gone by as quickly as the trees zoom past the train windows. I’m reflecting on almost ten years since I moved to Cambridge as Sufjan and his backing chorus chant that all things go, all things grow.

Despite the gulf of time between who I am today at 27, and who I was then at 17, I don’t feel as if I’ve wholly changed. I feel older, certainly, but not like a different person. For one, I am still living in Cambridge, a mere mile and a half away from where I first called home, in Inman Square as opposed to Kendall. I’m still a student, but not at MIT, and not for much longer. I’m still a hopeless romantic, a lover of art, a queer media enthusiast, an aspiring chef, a devoted concert attendee, and too online (although I have been consciously working on that). I still struggle with imposter syndrome, fear flying, and am prone to periods of derailing melancholy.

That’s not to say that my life has remained stagnant. Since graduating in 2021, I’ve been working on my Masters of Architecture down the river at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. In the last three, almost four years, I have had countless sleep deprived nights gluing pieces of models together, drawing floorplans, taking photographs, writing scripts, setting up presentations, finding perfect views, and commiserating with friends in the same boat as me. I’ve designed houses, monasteries, distilleries, community centers, theaters, churches, and a whole lot of things that can’t even truly be called architecture. I’ve logged so many hours onto Adobe’s Creative Suite. I’ve 3D printed probably a house’s worth of 
        plastic
      
 and built things I never thought I could. I finally learned how to code, despite resisting it stupidly during my time at MIT. Just this December, I presented my thesis on using queer theory to redesign religious spaces.

I’ve learned a lot, not just about architecture but also about myself and what I want out of life. I’ve cried many times but laughed many more. I started taking anti-depressants, which I resisted for years at MIT, convinced that nothing but pure logical thinking could get my 
        sadness to abate.
      
 I now enjoy eating at Clover, something I (a bit unfairly) hated for a long time. I’ve grown out my hair and then shaved it all off. I got surgery that changed my life and my relationship with my body for the better. I performed in drag in front of hundreds of people for the first time ever, and then did it again a year later, and again. I’ve learned to be more okay with solitude, finding peace with going to concerts or movies or restaurants alone. I deleted much of my social media and started reading the news. Running, a hobby I picked up begrudgingly in 2020 when the gyms and world closed down, is now something I look forward to in my routine, and I regularly jog across bridges I once wrote about crossing, my heart beating faster and reminding me that I’m alive as I breathe in cold riverside air. I obsessively scroll through and post my deepest, most vulnerable thoughts on Strava to make up for my lack of other internet time sinks. I caught up with old classmates I hadn’t seen in years at the Mega Pi Reunion in Las Vegas. In the words of 
        Sufjan,
      
 I fell in love 
        again,
      
 with people, with things, with life.

Even though I haven’t been far from MIT spatially, my life feels farther away from that time than a few miles can quantify. New buildings have cropped up around Cambridge and MIT. Places I’ve loved have 
        closed or changed,
      
 renovated to accommodate an ever-evolving city. Graduate school for architecture is starkly different from my undergraduate experience in engineering, and Harvard feels so far from MIT that it still shocks me three years later. Even when I cross register for classes, I don’t feel as if I quite belong anymore, as if I am an old friend that hasn’t yet realized we’ve outgrown a certain relationship. I wonder what my life would look like now had I stayed at MIT for graduate school. I am a person adapted to a new environment in ways I don’t even fully notice much of the time – wearing too much black, taking pictures of buildings I see on the street, laughing at jokes about Corbusier.

As I look for jobs now, I realize that my chapter in Cambridge might finally be coming to an end when I graduate in May. I’ve loved living here, loved spending time with friends I made in undergrad and meeting new friends in graduate school, loved getting to know how to navigate the city streets with ease, and loved the feeling of home I got when I stared down the bank of the Charles on my way to my apartment after a long trip. But, ten years feels like a long time to stay in one place while I’m still in my twenties. I feel the itch to explore something else for a time, even if a part of me knows I might still want to come back one day. The prospect of leaving is scary, even if it feels right. The entirety of my adulthood has unfolded in this city, but learning to let go (and to let grow) is a skill that getting older has forced me to learn.

It’s hard for me to envision a future where I’m not still here. Moreso than my first graduation from MIT, the end of one small chapter of my life, this time feels like the end of an entire part of my life’s novel, looming close by with its blank title page. The last few years, though filled with hardships of their own, have felt for the most part predictable: one semester led to another, and another, and everything was quite neatly laid out and planned for the duration of my time as a student. I would complete a year and continue to the next, comforted by the seemingly endless cycle of academia and the seasons it follows: fall, winter, spring, summer. When I graduate in May, there will be no semester to look forward to, no routine to fall back into. The next steps are a blur to me, even if I feel as if I have a steadier grip on the 
        overall qualities I want out of them.
      


Even the version of me that might leave will still be the person I was. Time has molded me into something more refined, but I am still the person who loves this place. I still miss Senior Haus and the community I found at MIT. I can’t help the part of me that, whether on a walk with friends or with a first date, points towards the small stone building on Amherst and says I used to live there, excitedly, wistfully. I happily talk about my days in undergrad with the rose colored glasses so familiar to memory. I tear up thinking about all the people I’ve met and grown apart from here, not knowing what words I could say to bridge the gap between five years and five hundred miles. I long for the warm sun on my skin as I sit on the Felipe’s rooftop, or on the docks of the Esplanade, or in Killian or the design school backyard. I hold these experiences so close to my heart that they cannot be removed, softened and absorbed into the beating tissue.

But for now, I’m still here. I can’t finish my degree without a couple more classes, not that I am in any rush to leave sooner than I have to. As a final full circle moment, as a former MIT student and blogger, I hope to cross register for a writing class in my last semester. As a now outsider, getting into classes has become considerably harder (though I have taken a few since leaving), but I’m hoping that some of my last few months here can be spent walking down the halls where I started this whole journey.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3792-800x1067.jpg

throughlines,Paolo A. '21,15,2025-01-27T00:00:00-05:00,"helloooooooo blogosphere!

so i wasn’t planning on posting this week — the usual feelings of hosage, and what to write, and all of that. but reading everyone’s blogs has brought me so much joy, and i’m sitting here on a Sunday afternoon just being chronically online, and so i have decided to give myself exactly one (1) hour to write this blog. we are starting at 4:18 PM GMT, and we will see what is to come.

gmt. greenwich mean time. i’m in the united kingdom for the first time! i just came back from my first sunday roast with some grad school friends and collaborators, which was absolutely delicious and had far too much food but i will enjoy the leftovers for many meals this week.

beef roast, Yorkshire pudding, leeks, cabbage, potatoes, cheesy cauliflower, and sooo much more. all incredible

i’m here in Southampton on grad studenting business. it is still wild to me that i’m a grad student at MIT, that i’ve been around here for 8 years, that i only have 5 more semesters of mit and then i will never be a student again, that there is a world in which in 2.5 years i leave this place that i call home.

the grad school things are going. as said in many more words in other posts, i was never someone who was fully sold on grad school. there are times where grad school has been hard, because of so many reasons — mental health, trying to figure out what to work on, feeling like nothing i was working on was interesting or would make a difference in the world, things in my personal life. but i think in the last year, things have started to take a bit more of an upswing. i’ve met kids who are such nerds that were so happy to be a part of my research giving them more math materials. i’ve worked with entire cities’ school districts to help them figure out how to manage their school assignment process. heck, i’m in the UK right now looking at a whole country’s admissions data to analyze some policy questions. if i look back on senior year me, and the ways they were thinking about what grad school could be, these were the types of things i could only dream of doing them. and just like how whenever i bike to the department, i look across killian and up to the big dome, and think about how wild it is that i’m here at mit. in that same vein, there is this sense of awe at “wow, i cannot believe i’m actually doing this.”

mit. ten years.

at the end of this year, cambridge will be the longest i’ve lived in any one place. and honestly it does feel like it is home these days. nevada, where i am ostensibly from, was only really home for the people it had. and so many of those people are now scattered around the country. including right in Boston — one of my dearest and closest friends from HS lives just a 20-minute trek down the Orange line, just 8 minutes from the Green Street stop. and i’m there multiple times a month, and it is a joy to keep him in my life in this way. and now i’m friends with his partners, and friends of those partners, and also their cat beanie who is an adorable void cat with one brain cell, and we play DnD together across multiple campaigns (i am perhaps too proud of the Aussie and Irish accents i’ve been developing for wella and myrna, respectively). and i am very grateful to Boston and the people i’m around for being this community in my life. the high school friends who’ve known me forever, the grad school friends who commiserate about and share the joys of work, the old undergrad friends who get together and give each other snark and visit texas roadhouse once a year for valentine’s day our birthday mystery hunt.

and while i am someone who has been afraid of stagnation, and still am, it’s something that i’ve felt better about over time. part of that is because of this buildup of community — as someone who moved around a lot as a kid, boston is the first place where i’ve felt settled, where i know how to get around without needing to look up directions, where there are all of these people around me i care about and who care about me, where i feel so comfortable and so much like me.

but the other part of it, and perhaps more important, is recognizing that change will always happen. i think i didn’t use to always believe this. when a close friend asked me, a year or so out of undergrad, how much i’d changed in various eras of life, i said something about how i felt like most of my changing in life (~80%?) had happened to be in high school, the period of my life where i felt like i “became a person”. and maybe 15% had happened in college, and 5% afterward. and to paolo circa 2022, that was truly what i believed.

but i think 2022-me was biased to believe that because the ways that i changed in college were more subtle. yes, high school may have been where i came into a self for the first time. and the values of HS me may have been kept throughout college, and through until now, but the ways i’ve changed have been more about how i interpret those values, the ways i choose to live them out, the things that get done with them.

i started writing that sentence, only to remember halfway through that it’s exactly what my very first sentence on the blogs was.

I like to think that people are defined by two things — the values that they hold and the choices that they make. So I figured that a half-decent way of introducing myself to the world (and give a decent overview of the bajillion things I’m busy with these days) is to share some decisions I’ve made over the past few weeks across all sorts of areas in my life. In alphabetical order…

In alphabetical order…

funny how things come full circle. (time check: 4:47. aaaa.)

there are certainly many ways in which i do feel the same as senior year me, who started blogging 5 years ago during the height of COVID, though often they do play out in different ways. certainly i’m still a very musical person, though it’s now come more to the forefront through a cappella and musicals. i’m also certainly a creature of impulse, making very stupid jokes and enjoying the little things in life.

perhaps the biggest way that last bit comes out is in my GRAing. GRAs, or Graduate Resident Advisors, are grad students who live in undergrad dorms and run study breaks, help students when they need things, provide advice, and just generally be a presence. i like to describe it as “i am an adult if you need one”.

as previously mentioned on the blogs by Amber ’24, i’m the gra for burton 1 (go b1ners!!). it’s very fun to be the b1ner gra, and not just because several bloggers have passed through (Amber V. ’24, Gosha G. ’24, Allison E. ’27, Veronica P. ’27) (god there are SO many of y’all aren’t there). i do find a very, very deep personal joy in getting to feed the b1ners through finals breakfasts, and being there if someone needs to talk about stress or how life is going or etc. but of course, being me, i also find deep joy in it for running my very, very stupid study breaks, including:

- a scavenger/puzzle hunt ending in discovering gallons of tosci’s ice cream in my freezer

- paolo-run taskmaster

- “deface my apartment” (parts 1, 2, and 3, which respectively, created sexy rat, kirby with his dogs out + a debate of whether my freezer was a fridge or a television, and a label saying “gullible” on my ceiling)

(if any b1ners are reading this, this is a secret SECRET announcement that my next study break is going to be T themed. as in, MBTA, tea i’m bringing back from Southampton. a giant T spoon that i made over the holidays. brought to you by the letter T. also lots of British snacks send me your requests :P)

(if you’re not a b1ner, you are not allowed to spill the beans to them. shh.)

(and if you are a b1ner. 💙💙💙 excited to see y’all again soon!)

so what are ways i feel like i’ve changed, ways that i didn’t appreciate before but recognize now, or new ways of change that have cropped up?

- i think there’s more of a calmness. i know that one friend in particular (hi, dean) would laugh at me for saying this, but truly, i do feel like my life is more calm than it used to be in a way i didn’t use to appreciate. the fact that i take practically all of my evenings and weekends off. that i make time for like 6 hours of DnD every week. that i’ve taken up all of these hobbies that i never did before. sure, i may still do a lot of things. but i think there’s a sense in which it feels calm because i feel more willing to let things go. to say no to things. to have an evening where i am just by myself, with a youtube video on or with just my thoughts or just looking at some music. and it is nice to do all of that.

- having more self-understanding about various aspects of myself. it’s one of those things where i feel like these blogs aren’t the best place to talk about it (at least, right now), with how intrinsic and personal they are, but those who know me irl will know precisely what i’m referring to. as with all things, it is a journey, and there is a joy in the process.

- a feeling of agency. through undergrad, i was always flying between activity X and Y and Z and then sleeping and then immediately getting back to it in the morning. hanging out with friends would entail psetting. breakfast in the next house dining hall meant reading a paper, too. but in recent years, i have had more of this sense of “i am allowed to make whatever choices i would like”. i can choose to go to LA with friends for a week, because why not? no one is stopping me from auditioning for musicals i am underqualified for, or learning silly accents, or just taking my bike and sitting in a park somewhere for two hours, or from meeting strangers and becoming friends with them, or making puzzle hunts such an integral part of my life that i fly back to Boston for literally 90 hours to do MIT Mystery Hunt.

me w/ rfong ’12 at mystery hunt 2025 :) see danny b.d. ’15’s post for further mystery hunt thoughts

when i was in chicago over the summer, i grabbed coffee with a high school friend. (i actually hadn’t remembered she was in town until i arrived, and the friend i was staying with asked “so… are you planning to meet up with anyone else while you’re here?”) i hadn’t talked to her in almost 4 years, and there was a deep joy in getting to see her again.

it didn’t take long for the rust to fall off of our friendship, and soon we were giving each other snark and talking about all sorts of things in our lives. i’d forgotten that at some point in high school, between being co-TAs and sharing study halls, we decided that we were people who were allowed to just ask each other anything. one particularly interesting conversation topic that we got to was “what are ways that you think you’ve changed from high school for the worse?”

in some ways, this is a bit of the antithesis of the section above. it’s taking a careful look at yourself and pointing to some part of you and saying “i wish that you weren’t there, and you were the way you were 7 years ago”. and it’s because of this that it feels a bit like an unfair question. it is forcing one to make judgments about oneself, to explicitly assign parts of oneself a negative quality.

of course, that isn’t to say i don’t have an answer — i did. but i bring this all up not to share that answer, but rather to focus on the fact that the part of myself i am working on the most right now is that of self-judgment. of letting myself be the person that i am, and leaving it at that. of feeling like i can identify with who i am. a few years ago, i noted with my therapist that i often said phrases like “when X happens, my brain thinks Y…” or “my body feels Z”. on reflection, that’s a very impersonal way of seeing the world — in some ways, beyond brain in a jar, where instead i am just experiencing the thoughts and feelings through the lens of some third-party brain and body.

when i talk about agency, and self-understanding, i think this really is what i’m referring to: the idea that i can just be the person i am.

i’m a little over time, as it is now 5:24PM, but i’m giving myself a little leeway from adding photos and getting distracted showing some people some photos and one of the grad school friends coming through the kitchen to grab some coffee. we all need a little leeway sometimes, and deadlines often are just recommendations :) [note: this is not advice for your mit app. that one is not a recommendation.]

it’s been fun to see this post come out of absolutely nothing in the last hour, to watch it grow and flourish and become something. and it’s been fun reading everyone’s posts this week, seeing all the ways that the bloggers have changed from their undergrad days, and yet, are still unmistakably themmany years later.

wishing all of you the best, and excited to keep seeing the ways in which everyone grows :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250126_124213045-1000x753.jpg

Living Meaningfully,Nisha D. '21,11,2025-01-26T00:00:00-05:00,"I really was not going to post. There were several excuses I was making to myself as to why I was not going to post:

- I am not even that old! I only graduated 4 years ago, or 1 MIT generation ago. My yapping has not quite faded into obscurity. 

- I did post an update last year, albeit in the top 1000 most used words in the English language. I tried to be descriptive. Not sure if I succeeded.

- Do I have words to post??? Should I be posting words when I have to actually be writing words for my job??? The latter of which actively have a hard deadline???

But then, all my friends started posting, and it was honestly so nice to see all the older bloglums give their updates that I decided to post too.

In real words: since leaving MIT, I have completely overhauled my life twice. The first was to move across the country to (less sunny than you’d think) San Francisco. It was part of an ongoing migration of most of my friends westward, some for grad school and some for work. Andrea M. ‘18 and I got an apartment just off 24th and Mission. My partner since freshman year of East Campus started his first year at Stanford. My childhood best friend moved a 
        fifteen minute bike ride
      
 away. 

It took me a while to feel like I lived in California. For the first few months, I was flying back and forth to the East coast somewhat often, and felt like I was never actually in San Francisco for more than a few weeks at a time. I don’t know if I ever felt like I lived there until I decided to leave.

But by all heuristics, I did live there. I made new friends at the Twitch office, where I commuted almost every day for the free lunch, biked to the wholesale coop for groceries, and generally enjoyed the trappings of adult life, like having a tech salary and going to trivia and/or drinks after work. I spent some weekends in Palo Alto, marveling at the beauty of Stanford campus as I biked from the Caltrain station to 
        Rains
      
; my partner spent the rest in the city. My best friend and I had a resolution to go to a new bar and meet people every Wednesday evening, which we maybe did exactly once and spent the vast majority of Wednesdays at her apartment laughing at funny text posts and Final Fantasy 7 fan art on Pinterest. My couch featured a rotating cast of MIT friends. When it didn’t, Andrea and I used it to enjoy what we termed “pastoral evenings”, sewing patches onto our clothes and watching Sex and the City, Grey’s Anatomy, or Bojack Horseman while gorging on Meredith Farms goat cheese and the rosemary sourdough from Arizmendi. 

Recounting this now, some part of me wonders: why did I ever leave? How did I ever leave the place with the largest proportion of my loved ones? When we graduate from MIT, we leave because we have to, not usually because we want to. I left San Francisco because I made the choice to.

One of the freedoms of having a 9-5 is that I could pick up hobbies in the meantime. I started fencing again, and used Twitch’s wellness fund to expense all of my gear. I learned how to snowboard. I went on long bike rides and appreciated how beautiful California really is. I traveled – at the end of 2022, I flew in a full circle around the world, stopping back home in Boston, my UROP mentor’s wedding in India, and getting lunch with a friend in Tokyo along the way. I got to take my partner around Japan for our five year anniversary, backpacking down a trail older than the country of America. The European summer trip finally happened. 

On the surface, this is objectively a wonderful life – surrounded by friends, lots of hobbies, and a job that I liked decently well. 

And yet, I suffered from what I can only describe as a weird sort of malaise. With an overabundance of free time, I would always find myself filling it with activities that were fun but not particularly fulfilling. My social battery seemed to always be on 0%; in the absence of tasks to do after work, most of it was spent hanging out with friends, which…should be fulfilling, right? But more often than not, I would reach the end of the week and rue all the social obligations I had signed myself up for. It was almost as if I had choice paralysis with how to spend my free time, and I would end most days unhappy about how I had spent it.

Many of the long time readers will know that I waffled back and forth about grad school many times on the blogs. In light of COVID (and post-MIT induced exhaustion), I had decided to not apply that year.

But mid-malaise, the lurking thought persisted. Should I let the act of working constantly take over my life again? I had tried very hard, through having a 9-5, to not let work be the thing that my life revolved around. Some of my friends can do this very well and set positive examples for what I could be like if I took a page from their book. I spent countless hours rolling the idea over in my head. A PhD was a lot of commitment, what if I just did a masters? But most masters are unfunded and not research based. Maybe I was just having a hard time adjusting to adulting; many of my older MIT friends tried to talk me down from the edge, so to speak. But then I would visit my partner at Stanford and imagine the life I could have there as a PhD student, and romanticize, because the grass is always greener on the other side. 

A good friend of mine from work liked to quote the line “Know thyself” from Ted Lasso. Remember the European summer trip I mentioned? One of the stops on that trip was to a conference in Venice to present some research from my UROP that had finally got accepted. I had presented at a few conferences virtually over COVID, but this was my first time attending one in person. It was here that I had my “Know thyself” moment, working on the conference presentation with my UROP mentor at 3 am approximately 8 hours before I was supposed to be giving it. It was still working hours in San Francisco, and my manager called to tell me that my promotion had gone through, and that I effectively was now making twice of my (already very generous for a 23 year old) salary. And in that moment, I found that I…didn’t care, and that I was more excited to talk about this cool research project that I had done than I was about the fact that my total comp was $300k+. At the end of that trip, I asked my UROP mentor to write me a rec letter for grad school. She also told me to not apply, but she did write the letter.

I applied to 
        2*
      
 PhD programs. Given PhD acceptance rates nowadays, this was ill-advised, but I had hubris, a reasonably strong publication record, and an unwillingness to leave the West coast. I had my sights set on Stanford – I could live with my partner in campus housing and not move far away from my friends. I dreamt about this existence so often that it became all-consuming. Tech layoffs were on the rise during my application season, and I was holding out for this vision of my life to manifest so that I wouldn’t have to worry about losing my job. 

One thing that has become exceedingly clear to me as of late is that I’m pretty used to getting what I want in life. I dreamed of MIT since I was a kid, and got admitted early action. I wanted to work in the gaming industry, and I worked at PlayStation and Twitch. I wanted to do a UROP related to games, and I found the perfect one. 

I did not get into Stanford. 

I later learned, after nearly a week spent in bed crying, that they did not accept anybody in my subfield of computer science that year because all the spots had gone to AI people 
        (classic)
      
. This did not make the rejection any less devastating. My dream was shattered, and I was left to wallow in its aftermath.

I did, however, get into the other school I applied to: the University of Washington. UW is in the 
        top 3
      
 biggest research hubs in human-computer interaction, and in undergrad, I had always toyed with the idea of applying there because I loved (and blogged extensively about) Seattle. 

I was initially so heartbroken about not getting into Stanford – and the prospect of actually leaving the Bay Area was so terrifying – that I wasn’t even going to go to the admitted students weekend. But it was a free trip to Seattle, if nothing else. So I went, with absolutely no expectation that I would actually end up going.

But over the course of three days spent on UW’s beautiful campus (even though the weather was classically Seattle), my imagination went to work. And slowly, I could see it. I could see myself walking hurriedly across Red Square to get to class, maybe peeping Mount Rainier if she was out that day. I could see myself working on my own projects and ideas with a level of research freedom that I hadn’t been able to imagine as an undergrad. I could go to the coffee shops and poke places that I had frequented over the course of two summers in Seattle. I could see myself working and engaging with a community of like-minded researchers from all across the university, and getting to fully immerse myself in the field. 

I could now see it, but the practicality of it was difficult. Even more of my friends were migrating to San Francisco. I didn’t have very many friends in Seattle, but the aforementioned work friend who likes Ted Lasso offered to move with me because he needed a change. I asked my partner if he would still love me if I moved to Seattle, and he said yes. 

Something about this decision has always been inevitable. In the parking lot of a gas station in Truckee, California, en route back from my partner’s lab Tahoe trip, at the end of a harrowing week wherein Twitch laid off 20% of its staff, I accepted UW’s offer. A few months later, my partner and I crammed my new car – a 
        Subaru Crosstrek
      
 I bought off a friend – with all my belongings that didn’t go in the UHaul shipping boxes and we took a meandering drive up to Seattle for my new life to begin. 

~~~

I am now a 2nd year PhD student. There have been ups and downs on this journey for sure. I had a wonderful first year, but am definitely crashing out a bit in my second. Before moving here, I don’t think I could have imagined myself owning a car, but I have grown into a version of myself who is capable of deciding to do an activity by myself and drive to it. Being long distance from my partner and most of my close friends is hard sometimes, but the short flights make it easy for us to see each other every 3-4 weeks. I have gotten rejected from more things in my first year in academia than I ever have in my life. My range of experienced emotions, which always seemed to be hovering somewhere within +/- 1 standard deviations of the mean in San Francisco, is now back to a more MIT-like +/- 3 standard deviations of the mean, which means that I sometimes feel more fulfilled than I ever have in my life and sometimes I am concerningly depressed.

I have less time to do things now. Most of it is spent on classes and research. But I fill the time I do have with the things that I really, really like doing. I fence three times a week, 2-3 hours every time, and have simultaneously improved and gotten worse at it. This is the first year that I’ve ever competed individually at fencing, and I have done terribly at every competition this year, despite improving technically. Fencing, it turns out, is mostly about mental fortitude under pressure, something which I find myself lacking in, even after 4 years of getting firehosed at MIT. But I know there’s a lesson somewhere in pushing through failure and showing up for something every day even if you’re doing bad at it.

I drive myself to snowboarding, sometimes on random weekdays if I feel so inclined. I live near the lake I really liked running around in the summer of 2020 and have run two Seattle half-marathons, with my eyes on the full. I’m 30 hours into Baldur’s Gate III, which I allow myself to play an hour of at the end of every day. I go to movies with my grad school pals. Limited time means that I’m forced to spend it in a way that I feel is meaningful. This includes grinding myself into the ground for my research, or crying over whatever failure is haunting me in the moment.

I purposely haven’t mentioned what I research until the very end of this post. The thing that I’ve realized about myself is that I need to have some sort of mission or quest that defines my life. Having a regular tech job is not conducive to this, but slaving day in and day out on your ideas is, even if you’re the only person who cares about your ideas.

A little over four years ago, in one of my last blog posts, I said:

Somewhere hidden in the word limits of the college essays I wrote for MIT was a dream: to one day make a video game that changes somebody’s life like a game changed mine.

 over half my lifetime ago now, but this mission has not changed: to show, to prove, to put my stake into the world that games are wonderful, educational, and can change lives for the better. The malaise that haunted me at Twitch was due to deviating a little too far from that mission. The thing that keeps me going through the slog of grad school is knowing that what I’m doing feels in service of that mission, even if nobody else cares about it. Even if the government is collapsing, even if its been raining for weeks, even if nothing in my life is actually going well, I know that I’m working on externalizing my most longstanding passion, and that makes things okay.

I research meaningful experiences in games. Some of the projects I’ve worked on in the last year include: misinformation education escape rooms, designing apps for people in long distance relationships who stay connected through 
        games
      
, and a smattering of other projects related to games, education, and mental health. The project I’m working on right now is attempting to tackle the large task of modelling personally meaningful experiences in games and how they’ve tangibly affected peoples’ behaviors. Technology can be pretty horrible, but it can also be a positive force in peoples’ lives. I attribute a large part of being a functional and motivated human being to playing games, and I’m invested in more people having those sorts of experiences.

I’m writing this post on the same day that the NSF is literally getting nuked. As a researcher, I obviously have a lot of uncertainty about what that could mean for me. I’m crossing my fingers that I’ll be able to make it to the end of my degree with funding. I’ve surprised myself by having vague dreams of being a professor, something that I did NOT enter grad school even considering. For now, I’m hoping to just put my head down and keep working on the things that I enjoy, and crossing my fingers to land on my feet. This strategy has mostly been successful thus far.

This post has ended up being at least 3x as long as I expected it to be – posters instinct never dies, I guess. But I’ll leave it with another 4 year old quote from past Nisha:

I hope that this path I’m on will keep stretching to greener and greener pastures, and that I can continue to say that I’m in the place that I am because, many years ago, I opened a tiny PSX emulator window on my chunky MacBook 2011 and fell deeply in love with the poorly pixelated world of Final Fantasy VII.

It took some hard choices. But I’m glad to be able to report to past Nisha, and to all of you, that I can, in fact, continue to say that.",,0
In which I am somehow still an MIT student,Alex M. '21,1,2025-01-26T00:00:00-05:00,"In broad strokes, my life in 2025 is not so different from my life in 2021. I’m a student at MIT studying aerospace engineering. I live in Somerville with my wife, whom I have lived with since January 2021, and whom I have 
        dated since October 2017.
      
 And yet, in the last four years, I graduated from MIT, twice. I got engaged and then married. I got a dog. I moved, once, and now I’ve lived in the same apartment for 3.5 years, after moving 5 times in a single year. I won a big novelty check in a 
        competition.
      
 I had many hiking and 
        rock climbing
      
 adventures.

When I last wrote here in spring 2021, I was living off-campus in Winter Hill, and spent my time anxiously waiting to get vaccinated for COVID, doomscrolling, and trying to “make the most” of my last semester of college, despite not being on campus. I took four classes, and had one UROP, and hung out with my roommates and my girlfriend.
 I knew I was going to graduate school, and I expected to complete my PhD in STAR Lab, and to work on satellite controls.

As spring 2021 bled into summer, I graduated online. I didn’t watch, but my parents did. I started in the AeroAstro PhD program at MIT on 
        June 1, 2021.
      
 I started grad school in STAR Lab, the same lab that I had UROP’ed in. That first year of grad school, I was funded to work on data validation for TROPICS, a weather satellite, and on efficiently co-locating data from different types of satellites. I also continued my UROP work on guidance, navigation, and control for BeaverCube, a student-built magnetically actuated satellite. I also worked on on-orbit cloud identification for small satellites, which eventually became my 
        master’s thesis.
      
 I also took classes. It was a very busy year.

In June 2022, my now-wife proposed while we were canoeing on Lake Washington on a very sunny day. I counter-proposed in August, at a picnic at a sculpture garden in Massachusetts. Even though we had already been engaged for months and she knew exactly what was happening, I was incredibly nervous — I wanted everything to be perfect. I kept waiting for a private moment, which never came because we were at a popular picnic spot on a sunny weekend day, so I eventually gave up and got down on one knee in front of a few random people. Even more embarrassingly, after hyping up the proposal for weeks, I forgot my entire speech. Luckily, she still said yes, and by the time we got married in 2024, my semi-botched proposal was just a sweet and funny memory.

shortly after engagement #2

My wife and I didn’t want to plan our wedding right away, so we decided to adopt a dog instead. 2023 is the year of the dog, we said; 2024 will be the year of the wedding. After using ChatGPT to write our landlord an email asking if we could get a dog and extensively discussing what potential problem behaviors we could and could not tolerate, I saw a dog on the internet with 
        really big ears
      
 and 
        “mild gastrointestinal issues”
      
 who needed a home. We named him Percy, which is short for Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover or for Perseus Jackson, depending on who you ask. Since April 2023, Percy has gone from 
        severely underweight at 35 lb to healthy at 50 lb,
      
 and has also transitioned from prescription dog food to normal dog food. He is a very friendly and playful dog who has been described as 
        “difficult to harness and leash” (because he gets too excited) and as having a “lust for life”.
      
 He loves food, going outside, eating random stuff off the sidewalk, playing fetch, and interrupting Zoom meetings.

I also switched research groups in 2023. After finishing my master’s thesis, I wanted to focus on controls and optimization for my PhD. I had actually been interested in controls since before starting grad school, and had even worked on satellite controls as an undergrad in STAR Lab. My advisor was also very supportive of me and was basically willing to let me research whatever I wanted. However, STAR Lab’s research focuses primarily on space optics and space systems, and I found it difficult to settle on a project and find collaborators. This wasn’t an issue with my previous UROP, because I had been working with Patrick, a senior grad student who shared my research interests. But 
        Patrick was graduating soon,
      
 and I wanted to start a new project focused on planetary entry, descent, and landing, but I didn’t feel equipped to work entirely on my own. I felt (and still feel) that it’s not possible to do substantive original research in a vacuum. Successful researchers collaborate, and try to produce work which fits into and is in conversation with the broader scientific literature.

So, even though I felt perfectly welcome in STAR Lab, I switched into the Aerospace Controls Lab (ACL) towards the end of 2023. Switching labs is hard and humbling and I’m glad that I did it. I felt like I knew as much as a first-year student, but as a third-year, I also felt pressure to publish and to have a clearly defined research vision. I spent most of my third year reading papers and taking extra classes to try to catch up. My PhD research focuses on uncertainty-aware guidance algorithms for aerocapture, which is a maneuver where a spacecraft plunges through the atmosphere of a planet to slow itself down, in order to successfully enter into an orbit around the planet. So, I read about aerocapture, and uncertainty-aware path planning, and for good measure, I read a lot of recent papers from ACL and related groups at other institutions, and I read the papers that those papers cited, and I read the papers that those papers cited. At one point, I spent a weekend in New Hampshire taking a 
        self-rescue course for rock climbers, and I brought a stack of papers to read in my sleeping bag at night.
      


In addition to reading and taking controls classes, I also spent a lot of time developing my own aerocapture simulation and re-implementing different algorithms from the literature. I was very busy, but I was also not publishing. My new advisor suggested that I defend my thesis proposal by the end of the semester, which he defined as “the end of May”, so I scheduled my thesis proposal defense for May 31. I passed, officially turning me into an 
        ABD grad student.
      
 However, the dissertation is the hard part and the whole point of the PhD, so I still felt very far away from graduation. Also, I was getting married at the end of June, and I still didn’t have a tie, and hadn’t written my vows. Also, even though my PhD committee approved my thesis proposal, they had 
        fairly different ideas about what I should do next. 
      
Also, I had to get on a cross-country flight six hours later to attend my 
        brother’s high school graduation,
      
 and I hadn’t packed.

Luckily, I made my flight, and I wrote my vows, and my wife bought me a tie while I was at my brother’s graduation. The last two weeks of June were a blur of wedding planning. We went to the florist, and designed table numbers, and got a cashier’s check to send to the caterer, and made a shopping list for our rehearsal dinner. We learned our venue did not allow open flames and redesigned our ceremony to use artificial flowers instead of candles. My wife, who is a program manager and has project management skills that I do not have and greatly admire, took the lead on planning, so somehow I only experienced a fraction of the work, but we were both busy. Suddenly, it was June 30 and we were driving to the venue. The sky threatened thunderstorms, but the weather held, and soon we were taking photos, and then walking down the aisle. It was the best day of my life. I love being in love, and I loved celebrating with a small group of family and friends. Our wedding was officiated by a friend, and other friends signed our ketubah as witnesses, helped set up, designed floral table arrangements, and DJ’ed the reception. It was really special to see our community come together for us.

After a brief mini-honeymoon in Providence, we returned to Somerville and I returned to my normal life, except with 
        more name change paperwork.
      
 I started working towards the first conference paper of my PhD, and climbed as much as I could. I was training for a trip to Goat Wall in Mazama, WA to climb Flyboys, an easy/moderate 18-pitch sport route, with my friend Collin. Towards the end of September, shortly after submitting my conference paper, we flew into Seattle, where I borrowed my dad’s SUV and some camping gear. Next, we drove to Bellingham, where Collin borrowed his friend’s SUV and some camping gear from his mom. Then, we drove in separate cars for about four hours on the 
        very beautiful
      
 and 
        fairly remote
      
 North Cascades Highway, communicating by 
        Rocky Talkie.
      


After 
        dropping off one of the cars at the top of Goat Wall,
      
 we had a taste of the Wild West at 
        BJ’s Branding Iron Saloon
      
 in Twisp, WA, and set up camp in the dark. We woke up before sunrise, broke camp, and headed to the base of Goat Wall. It was cold, but the climbing was fun and surprisingly easy, and the rock quality was very good. Several hours and 14 pitches later, it started to rain. We felt ready to be done, but we were not done. Climbing 18 pitches is sort of like 
        being an MIT student for 18 consecutive semesters.
      
 We kept going. We topped out a little after 5 pm, after about ten hours of climbing, and the sun broke through the clouds, and it felt incredible.

The next day, we set out to 
        Washington Pass
      
 to summit Liberty Bell via the Beckey Route. We did not succeed. After two hours of hiking, including a spicy scramble up a 
        class 4 gully,
      
 we reached the base of the climb in an 
        exposed notch between Liberty Bell and Concord Tower.
      
 While waiting for another climbing party to start moving, we got very cold, and then we got cold feet. We slowly inched our way out of the gully, and the wind died down and the sun came out as we exited the gully onto a 
        marked climber’s trail, 
      
 and then continued downhill to a hiking trail to Blue Lake. We ditched our packs just off the trail and decided to check out Blue Lake. We talked about bringing a bothy bag on future alpine trips to protect against the cold, and we took photos. Then, we picked up our bags, hiked out, drove west for hours on the North Cascades Highway, and finally ate some well-deserved pizza.

Now it’s January 2025. I’m participating in MITOC Winter School, and trying to extend the conference paper I submitted last fall into a journal paper, while also starting what will hopefully become the second contribution of my PhD. I also spend a lot of time 
        playing video games
      
 with and cooking with my wife. Yesterday, we took Percy to Middlesex Fells and he had a blast running around in the mud. The day before that, I hiked Liberty and Flume with MITOC and had a blast walking around in the snow. Tomorrow, I’ll take the T to MIT, and I’ll code and read and write and return some gear to the MITOC office. I don’t know where I’ll be in four years, but I like my life now, and for that I am very grateful.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/engagement-400x301.jpg

The After,Kirsten L. '15,2,2025-01-26T00:00:00-05:00,"In a couple months, I’ll be back in Cambridge after 10 years of taking those first steps through Lobby 7 as a prefrosh. The inevitable soul searching happening as I try and remember what has happened since then. What is life like after MIT?

Same same and different.

I’m still an engineer, working in the machine that is Big Tech. My day to day involves a lot less work on psets, a lot more talking with people, and probably the same amount of time spent in CAD. I’m still hacking it out here in the world of product design, so thank you DPD for exposing me to my future career⚙️! I have been able to ship a few products that are out there in the real world, and the feeling of making something that gets used around the world never stops being 🤯.

My job has given me the opportunity to travel internationally, which then enabled fun leisure travel. I’ve been able to keep in touch with some of my friends who I met at the other Cambridge 🇬🇧(RIP CME). Michael C. and I even travelled together to Tanzania for a safari- definitely a core memory. 

 



I feel lucky to call San Francisco my home. My community here still skews heavily from my MIT ties- a very present reminder of the bonds that tie us back to a place that simultaneously felt like hell and heaven (Though nostalgia tends to skew things heavier to the latter). I see the drive and ambition we had as students directed to new goals and projects- like starting new companies or families. I’ve also been to 10 MIT weddings in the last 5 years from various college friends. I’ve loved getting to be a part of my friend’s next steps in lives, and those weekends make me realize how special and precious friendship is.Every year, the same group of friends I met in Maseeh gathers on zoom for our annual Secret Santa exchange. We’ve done this every year since we were freshmen, and now look forward to sharing our annual updates!



A couple of months ago, I got married to my best friend- who I met at work and still get to work close to (but not too closely) every day. Funnily enough, he grew up 20 minutes away from where I lived in Georgia. Planning our wedding was the biggest, most rewarding project I’ve taken on since graduating. Balancing everyone’s constraints while holding our own vision was tough, but we were really proud of how everything turned out (for anyone planning a wedding, I promise it’s worth it). My bridesmaids were all 15s who live in SF, friends who continue to be an inspiration and support throughout my life. 

Life progresses slower after MIT.

Less drinking from a firehose, and more figuring out how to find inspiration without the pressure of the firehose. The problems are bigger and more impactful (finding a job, navigating team changes, making a home), but getting to a solution follows the same process from school. I feel like the same person I did when I graduated, but more confident and less stressed about working through the things life throws my way. That’s been my life after MIT. Looking forward to being back there in June!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3238-400x533.jpeg

"Learning how to be a human being, not a human doing",Caroline M. '18,14,2025-01-26T00:00:00-05:00,"When I graduated in 2018, I was talking to my partner about how lost I felt. Igniting civic engagement on campus and advocating for peer to peer mental health had been my purpose and identity. And after leaving – I felt like a balloon with it’s strings cut.

Adrift. Empty. Useless.

I didn’t know what to do with myself or what was important to me – faced with decisions like where to live and to work. I didn’t have values that could guide me – only an emptiness that needed to be filled by feeling useful. Productive.

Only after six years of losing and almost losing things I didn’t realize were important, do I now have things I won’t let go of. Things I cannot live without.

Only now, have I started to live as a human being and not a human doing.

Here are some of the things I’ve learned to value, through the eyes of my younger selves to now.

 

I’m 18 and a freshman. I don’t have time to waste on video games, there are “better things to do with my time”.  I’m proud of the fact that not a single game is downloaded on my phone or computer. 

 

I’m 24 and sitting down and playing games is something I look forward to. After a long day, capturing Pokemon alongside nostalgic 8-bit music, listening to killer vaporwave beats from a murder mystery, and completing a quest with friends in Baldur’s Gate 3 fill my heart gauge with energy. I’ve learned that playing games (maybe not until 3am) isn’t something to feel guilty about when it brings me joy. 

I learn to value time to decompress and play. 

Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne

I’m 19 and a sophomore. I’m crashing in Tokyo with a friend I made through inline skating. She’s almost 30 and lying in bed with a heating pack on her back after only a gentle 10 mile skate. I look away, embarrassed for her and think “I won’t be like that.” I’m proud of my “self-sufficiency” and carry everything I need for months of travel in just one backpack with my skates strapped on top.

 

I’m 25 and in a rice roll (cheongfun) restaurant in Toronto with a friend. It’s been an extraordinarily long day. Despite looking forward to this trip for years, I spent the day mentally managing my chronic ankle pain and tendonitis. At the art museum, I was sitting on a bench swapping my ankle brace for my aircast ankle boot – the sound of velcro echoes. In Chinatown, we walk at a snail pace. Guilt increases with every step as I know he wanted to walk around more of the city.

That evening, the relief of finally sitting down, the shame of my inability to do more, and the mental load of the pain push me over the edge. Big, fat, Spirited Away Chihiro tears fall onto my phone as I am stuck on an Uber screen, agonizing over whether I spend $20 to Uber home or take public transit (and walk more). He’s a great friend and says he’ll just cover the Uber and not to stress.

(It was really good cheongfun tho)

Many physical therapy and acupuncture appointments later.

I’m 28 and using a muscle roller on my IT band, psoas muscle, and back is now part of my nightly routine. I invest in acupuncture and massage appointments to help my muscles relax and not strain my tendons.

Like oiling a car or cleaning my skate bearings, I now understand that effort and care need to paid for something to function well. I no longer skip lunch, work long hours, and ignore my muscle pain, pretending sacrifice means I’m being hardcore and committed to my work. It’s just a sign of neglect. 

I’ve learned to value maintaining my health. 

I’m 20 and a junior. I inline skate to everywhere on campus, partly because I wake up at 8:55am to get to a 9am class. Every morning I sprint out the door and see if I can beat my previous commute time, arriving to class winded and sweaty. Adrenaline is my coach, my crutch, and my addiction. When friends wave in the hallway, I wave, but rarely stop – always on my way to somewhere. One day, a friend tells me, “Hanging out with you feels like a meeting sometimes”. I’m crushed to hear it, but when strap my skates up to meet someone else in 15 minutes, I know he’s right. 

 

I’m 27 and am hospitalized after falling on my skates, causing internal bleeding to my spleen and liver. I had been rushing from an appointment to a work meeting and mentally distracted from work stress. The nurses ask sympathetically if I was in a car accident and warn that I may need surgery to remove my spleen permanently. A few days later, one of my friends picks me up from the hospital in a torrential rain that floods Memorial Drive.

Instead of taking time off to heal, I worry about a work project and try working from bed through debilitating nerve pain near the injured organs. My partner helps me get up to go to the bathroom and I eat fruit yogurt pouches for months.

In the hospital with jinbesan – a whale shark character by sanrio (I’m on a lot of painkillers)

Many stomach meds and ginger candies later.

I’m 28 and have learned to not skate while stressed and just take the bus, an uber, or walk. My calendar isn’t full of back to back meetings – there are 30 min or 1 hour spaces in between. My morning alarm is now 20 minutes before my first meeting, not 2 minutes. I want to live life centered, grounded, and in my body – not running from it.

I learn to value mental breathing room. 

I’m 21 and just graduated, starting a new job at a nonprofit. At the end of every work day, the only emotion I feel is guilt for not having done enough. Most days I never see the sun because by the time I finish, the sun has set. Some days I take a break and then work from 10p to past midnight until I feel like I’ve done enough. When my younger brother visits and wants to hang out, I squeeze him in here and there, feeling further behind on work. I never feel a sense of accomplishment regardless of how many slide decks I finish, reports I publish, programs I lead – it’s just never enough.

 

I’m 28 and last week finally achieved one of my long-time goals to be a photographer for a wedding. Hearing my friend, the bride, talk about how precious this one picture I took of her dad is will always stay with me. And I overcame my fear of long-exposure and took this rad picture of light up poi at the dance part.



I now spend more time with my friends, on photography and storytelling, and with my family. Despite working at a nonprofit, I’ve realized that mission fulfillment isn’t the only kind of fulfillment.

Making sure I’ve enough energy to have deep discussions about movies with friends and my partner, take photos of friends and make them feel seen, and savor the time I have with my parents, all make me look forward to waking up every morning.

I’ve learned to value finding fulfillment outside of just my job.

I’m 22 and it’s been a year since I graduated. The Red Line rushes through the tunnel on the way out of Charles MGH. The familiar sensation makes me feel disappointed that I’m still in Boston, wondering if I should move to DC or NYC or SF like so many other friends. Or maybe even Japan.

 

I’m 26 and hosting a barbecue with friends in the area. We’re doing cumin lamb skewers, grilled corn, grilled bok choy, and cantonese roast pork. We’re just catching up as the food gets nice and toasty. As voices overlap and wash over me, gratitude catches on my tongue like a snowflake. I realize I could never have done this if I moved overseas to Japan or Germany.

Seriously, grilled bokchoy is crazy underrated.

I’m 28 and have been in Boston for 10 years now including undergrad. My first photoshoots were with MIT friends in the Boston area. When I was bedridden from my accident, MIT friends came over to help cook the easiest to digest lentils. When I was isolated and lonely during COVID, I met up with MIT friends in parks to share food socially distanced.

I’ve learned to value a city to call home. 

I’m 24 and it’s peak COVID. Messages on my phone are unread for months, some years. Guilt wraps me like a force field, suffocating my best intentions. But next to guilt is also relief. It’s COVID so now I have an excuse for disappearing and not responding earlier! The “counter” has been reset so I can reach out to people without needing to explain that I’ve been depressed, lost, and overwhelmed. Except that… no messages materialize. Conversations continue unheard, in my head.

Many “sorry it’s been forever” later.

I’m 28 and shame no longer gets in the way of living life with my friends as it happens. After many sessions of therapy, my friends’ infinite patience, and the magic of discord communities, “friendshiping” happens everyday. High school best friends are now just best friends and we share our pulls from Pokemon TCG Pocket. I’m not always “catching up” with friends, because they already know what I’m up to from discord updates or informal voice calls. We can just enjoy each other’s company, watch an anime episode, or play Stardew Valley.

And in the roughest days of my dad’s cancer treatments, their hug emojis felt like real hugs. And when they’re having trouble waking up to get to work or going through a breakup of their partner of 6 years, I send hug emojis, stickers, and jinbesan their way too.

Jinbe make everything better

I’ve learned to value being there for my friends as life happens. 

I’m 28 and I feel a deep peace that’s new to me. A peace that comes when I see my actions aligning with my values. The internal becoming external.

I no longer feel ashamed at the many ways I don’t live up to my values or at the supposed lack of external progress in my life. I don’t fixate on how I think I’ve squandered the resources and guidance given to me by mentors at MIT, wasting my potential.

Instead, these words from one of my mentors, Kim, is a compass I hold closely – “Do what makes you content.”

 

I’m learning to build my life bit by bit and value the things that bring me joy. 

I’m learning to smile without feeling guilty about it – valuing my own worthiness to deserve happiness untied to productivity. 

I’m unlearning the expectations of productivity that carried me through MIT and high school. 

I’m learning how to be a human being and not a human doing. 

 

And when I do that, I know deep in my bones, that I am making the most of the life I’ve been given. I’m proud of these precious lessons I’ve learned and excited to see where it goes.

This is life after MIT.

From the creator Yumiko Takeuchi on Jinbesan:

“The world where the sun and bubbles sparkle is truly wonderful, and I also love the creatures that swim leisurely in it. Even with busy days, the water is quiet, clean, and relaxing. I wanted to express that kind of worldview in Jinbee.“

Note about writing

This is my first blog since graduating in 2018, and also my first public piece of writing in six years.  For six years I’ve been ashamed about my own writing and voice – believing that it too self-conscious or simplistic. Every time I tried to write, I cringed at the words and couldn’t continue.

It’s taken me many therapy sessions to get to the point where I don’t criticize each word as it lands on the page, letting them come out as they are.  I went through 3 drafts before publishing this one, each looking almost completely different than the last.

If this feels familiar, I want you to give your voice a chance. It deserves to be nourished. It deserves a chance to explore and evolve.  It deserves a chance to be heard by you. Rediscovering writing has felt nothing less than liberating and a therapy in itself.

Give it a shot and let me know how it goes <3

Special thank you to my partner, CD, JX, and AH for reading the “many drafts later” of this post and helping me grow as a writer and person.

And thank you to my therapist and coach Josh for guiding me past the “Should’s” and helping me rediscover writing, expression, and photography.

A Great Hunger,Selam G. '18,5,2025-01-25T00:00:00-05:00,"The three main characters from the film Burning

In Lee Chang-dong’s film Burning, there is a concept of a “Little Hunger” and a “Great Hunger”. The Little Hunger is the desire for the material, basic needs and beyond, where the Great Hunger is a deeper search for meaning and understanding in life. The film is oriented around this theme, demonstrated by the three main characters’ central drama. Who has the Great Hunger, and who has the Little Hunger? Does the Great Hunger dissolve when you think you have found the answer? 

It’s a strange movie brimming with symbolism that leaves you unsettled when you finish it, and yet (for me at least) unable to stop thinking about it. 

In reality I think we all have a little bit of both Hungers. On a practical level, we all have to feed our Little Hunger, which includes our literal hunger, to survive. But precisely because of that, we can let the Great Hunger disappear if we want; we can survive without it. I think I could describe the 7 years since I graduated (but especially the first 4 or so) as wishing my Great Hunger would disappear, since I was so frustrated to never find the answers. It distracted me from doing day-to-day work, since I felt like I was missing a central ‘why’. It distracted me from a straightforward career progression too–though I’m learning that there usually isn’t one anyway. 

For this reason, it was refreshing to read a few posts from alumni who are now over 15 years from when they graduated. With 7 years post-grad, I’m still in the midst of figuring things out–trying to solve both Hungers, really. I realized I didn’t know what I wanted to write at first when Petey reached out for posts from blogger alumni. So I decided to use one of my tactics against writer’s block: pilfering through my “graveyard”, discarded posts or snippets that were never published. I had wanted to write for years about this transitional period, but couldn’t find the right words. Here’s a few words I did find: 

When I was interviewed as part of my application to MIT, my interviewer [Chris D. ‘82] said something brutally honest that stuck with me. “For a long time,” he said, “MIT has recruited people who are great at what they do, technically capable, but don’t have dreams of their own. They are people who Harvard students hire to work on their dreams. I think now, MIT has started looking for people who have a lot of initiative; who will pursue their own dreams.” Graduating college–or high school, or grad school, or whatever it is that might allow you to enter “the rest of your life”–is the condition of realizing how incomprehensibly long and vast life is, yet at the same time, how fleetingly short and finite. You wonder, at some 17-25 years old, how you will fill the blank canvas of 60 or 70 years ahead of you, and simultaneously, how you can ever possibly do enough with so little space. My life is too short to change the world, too long to be only one thing, too fleeting not to enjoy myself, too massive to not have a plan.

My life is too short to change the world, too long to be only one thing, too fleeting not to enjoy myself, too massive to not have a plan.

When I graduated, I grasped the edges of my limitations–feeling like I couldn’t learn fast enough or work hard enough. After taking a role at a very early stage startup with frequent 14+ hour days and weekends, I knew I didn’t want that kind of schedule–which made entrepreneurship feel out of reach. But what would replace it? What was my dream, as an MIT graduate? Was I just too tired, at that point, to have one? 

Part of what I’ve been struggling with alongside the Hungers is what I like to call “the Iron Man Problem” of MIT graduates (a problem that I have probably contributed to). The problem is that, as MIT’s reputation has grown in tandem with the technology industry, going from weird niche tech school à la 
        Caltech
      
 toward a national higher education symbol like Harvard, the expectation is that the students are somehow uniquely different and adept from every other engineer in the country, even compared to other engineers from the top 10 or 20 schools (being able to build Iron Man suits overnight, for example). 

Harvard has its roots in the humanities, squishier subjects where it’s harder to immediately evaluate someone’s performance the way you can in, say, a coding interview. Increasingly, I feel the weight of the Iron Man expectation. Are you allowed to make mistakes if you’re an MIT graduate, when you received such a coveted position? Will you have to live the rest of your life proving you deserved it? 

I think now more than ever, this is something that concerns the last 10 years of graduates, amplifying the imposter syndrome that many of us will have, especially those of us who were told even before MIT that we could never be scientists, engineers, or mathematicians. Even if I had attended a different school, I can never look to the world to tell me I deserve my education or my career. Slowly I have realized that, to muster up the titanium spine, the unbreakable backbone I will need to continue in this field is no easy feat. As a high school student, I thought that graduating college was the final frontier, when in reality, it’s just the beginning. 

Burning’s protagonist literally searching for something through fields

I found myself haunted by this as I bounced around various Boston startups and robotics roles. Was any of it good enough–my job, my output? It didn’t feel newsworthy or polished, I wasn’t an entrepreneur myself or a startup executive (what an expectation to have at 25) or even simply working at a big tech company. Perhaps the Iron Man expectation was that a sufficiently well fed Little Hunger should quiet the Great one, that it would prove some kind of meaning, at least to other people. 

I had a perfectly decent career progression, built a sturdy resume, and began to look toward the next chapter. But after a while I felt like I didn’t know anymore how to distinguish between the Great Hunger of intellectual curiosity and a kind of depraved, capitalistic hunger for status. I call it depraved, the Little Hunger, and yet, like the many MIT Africans before me and beside me, I supported relatives and projects back home with the salary that I earned, and I was immensely proud of that. The other feeling that comes from having coveted privileges is a sense of duty, a mandate to do good in the world, one which I channeled to the Muti water project as an undergrad, and now use on the alumni board of the MIT Africa Impact Fund. 

The Great Hunger was the question of whether I had chosen the right path with 
        engineering,
      
 whether I could or should find meaning in work. The Little Hunger had ballooned unsustainably, saying that wealth or status would be the thing that made me feel whole, and practically, would allow me to give more, provide more. In hindsight, I would say I struggled to balance (or even identify) the two Hungers, to feel fulfilled in all the different pieces of my life. I found it somehow unacceptable to just be a normal person who uses different parts of their life to fulfill these things, or to even seem average.  

Faced with all these questions (amplified to the nth degree by 2020) I did what any person who pursued academic achievement for four-fifths of their life does: apply to graduate school. 

I write to you from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a few minutes from the Carnegie Mellon University campus, which I “deferred” a decade ago in favor of MIT. Guided by a gut feeling, I intentionally chose not to attend MIT for grad school, to see if a different environment and campus culture would coax something different out of me. In CMU I wanted a place where I hoped I could find academic and research redemption, where I could forge my titanium spine and emerge as the LinkedIn version of the Terminator (or something). 

On paper, I achieved what I set out to do, getting grades and publishing papers, throwing them into the maw of my imposter syndrome. Yet the soft, human part of me persists, the Great Hunger, the emotions, my fear and empathy and love. The things that distract me from a robotic output of work.

So in my final semester at CMU, I am taking a course in art and ML (one that’s more art than machine learning) and a course in ethics and ML (that is heavy on the ethics). I am doing what I can to try feeding my Great Hunger. I am slogging through my job search, still not entirely certain where I’ll end up, but believing that I am capable and worthy, knowing I am so effective and credentialed that even if I just want a career to feed the Little Hunger, I will certainly obtain one. I am aware that this is a unique privilege, and I try to be quick to support others however I can. 

In-between all that, I watch films and shows, procrastinate, do yoga, plan trips. I sleep, even if I’m staring down a deadline or haven’t been “productive enough” that day. I spend time with friends and family. I treasure the visits and calls with my long-distance fiancé, Victor S. ‘21. I try to cherish all the life that happens in the in-between, whether mundane or extraordinary. 

And I try to respect my inner beasts, rather than fight them.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/burning-2018-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-1000x563.jpg

Liminal Activities Period,Joel G. '18,4,2025-01-25T00:00:00-05:00,"It’s been over six years since I graduated MIT – longer than I spent in school, but not long enough that my body has totally disconnected from the calendar. Fall still feels like the start of the school year, full of promise and mystery and challenges that I’m not prepared for but will somehow survive anyway. Summer feels like being momentarily ejected from the bubble to glimpse the wider world and plot real moves. And January, of course, is IAP.

“Independent Activities Period” is a deceptively bland name for what is in my opinion MIT’s greatest invention. It is the spiritual opposite of summer – instead of escaping, it’s about relaxing deeper into the bubble than ever, into a special world only accessible in the liminal space between semesters.

I remember starting every IAP in the exact same way. Back from the holidays, still burnt out from the fall semester, barely able to believe that I passed and do not in fact have an interminable cloud of work hanging over me, I’d collapse: flop on the couch in Zeta Psi common room, wallow in exhaustion, binge three movies a day.

I remember wondering how long it could last. If the next semester never started, would I ever get up off the couch? I despaired at the possibility that I lacked the intrinsic motivation that drives people toward self-actualization or whatever. Shouldn’t I be pursuing my interests? Learning new things? I saw wallowing as my ‘revealed preference’, each passing day sealing my indictment as a hopelessly lazy person. As often pointed out on the blogs, MIT culture can make you feel really guilty for not constantly tooling.

To my amazement, the wallowing never lasted forever. It didn’t suddenly stop one magical morning like an allergy medication advertisement. And it’s not like it would start to reverse, drawing me back into frantic finals-week grindset. Instead, every year, the exhaustion would unfold into a weird, timeless, dreamy freedom. I’d start clicking links instead of just scrolling, following rabbit holes deeper and deeper. When you’re lying on the couch you conserve energy, which lets your imagination run wilder than normal: could I bulk order this from Alibaba? could I make that with materials I have here in the house? Dumb ideas start sounding interesting and you start taking jokes too literally.

One year, my friend Kevin Kwok and I got a batch of custom frisbees printed with an obscure programming language inside-joke. Scheme, a language invented at MIT by Gerry Sussman and Guy Steele, was first described in a famous series of papers collectively called the “lambda papers” since they were all titled “Lambda: the Ultimate ___” (Lambda: the Ultimate Imperative, Lambda: the Ultimate GOTO, etc). We printed the MIT Scheme logo, featuring the infamous Y combinator, on top to make “Lambda: the Ultimate Frisbee”.



Is it art? A joke? Is it even funny? Hard to tell. But now we had 100 frisbees to give away.

After I graduated, I knew that it would be easy to lose the magic, and I was determined to keep it alive. It’s not just about “carving out time for personal projects”. It’s mostly about re-creating a paratelic mindset. It starts by lying on the couch and disconnecting from everything – every incentive, every career goal, the itch of jealousy, the field of status games. After all that drifts away, what do you start daydreaming about?



Last winter I started playing around with edge-lit acrylic panels. Acrylic is cheap and you can laser-cut it into any shapes you want, and if you put LED strips around the edge (pointing inwards) and take a sander both sides, you get an amazing diffuse glow from the whole piece. I liked this a lot because I always hated the harsh glare of LED strips when seen directly. But this was soft and warm!



At first I tried to make a sort of 3d “flower” of acrylic panel petals, but this was a disaster since they were fairly heavy and I didn’t know how to secure them in a rigid arrangement. So instead I thought I’d try tiling the 2d plane. I wanted something that looked more organic than symmetric or pixelated. Eventually I found a Voronoi component in Grasshopper, a visual programming environment for parametric modeling that comes with Rhino.



I played around until I found a satisfying shape, exported the design, and got it laser cut at NYC Resistor, a makerspace here in Brooklyn.



Edging each panel with LED strips was time-consuming. But spending unreasonable amounts of time on something is a classic IAP move. In IAP mindset, nothing is a waste of time.



Even after I finished, I still wasn’t sure what to call it. What had I just made? It didn’t matter; it looked great and I was proud of it.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6837-1000x563.jpeg

"6.5 Years Post-Graduation, I’m a Beading Artist",Yuliya K. '18,7,2025-01-25T00:00:00-05:00,"About 6.5 years ago, I graduated with a Philosophy degree and a minor in Political Science.

Two and a half years ago, after graduating again from Northwestern University’s science and health journalism program, I returned to the blogs to let people know: “I did not graduate from MIT on time due to mental health issues, but I’m thriving, and I’m a health journalist.”

Today, another twist: It wasn’t a mental health issue, and I’m no longer a writer—I’m a beading artist.

That may sound like fundamentally straying from the path set up by my education, but it was meant to be. I’m going to explain and sprinkle some of my artworks throughout—here’s piece #1.

Katsushika Hokusai’s “The Great Wave” – Beaded Reproduction

A quick recap of what I did between graduating and becoming a full-time artist (in the most non-linear path I could find on Canva):



Somewhere in there, I also discovered that, good news, I wasn’t sleeping through 90% of my college classes because of a vague mood disorder. Bad news: The culprit was (and is) a rare and under-researched sleep disorder. And yes, a chronic incurable diagnosis is terrifying to discover. But what a relief to know that, with the right medication—if only I got referred to the right specialist—I could’ve woken up for 100% of my classes! Imagine thinking for years that it’s all in your head… And overnight, you learn that it’s “sleep inertia” and actually you can wake up so easily if you have those meds.

I could insert a million-word rant about the U.S. healthcare system here: From the way fat patients (like me) get denied appropriate care to how few answers providers actually have—and how much their lives are complicated by zealously money-saving insurance companies… But instead: art!

Georges Seurat’s “A Sunday on La Grande Jatte” – Beaded Reproduction

So what now? Well, the one medication FDA-approved for my sleep disorder didn’t magically fix everything. In the fall of 2023, I quit my senior management position—the one I thought was the peak of corporate American dreams. In the fall of 2024, no longer able to produce thoroughly researched medical articles, I stopped health writing too.

What I could still produce, though, was art. And I loved it! In the midst of so much leaving my list of accessible opportunities, I had something that brought me joy, hope, and peace.

Love is Love in Lincoln Park, Chicago – Beaded Art

For months before I quit my writing job, I’d been sharing my work with the world: through local artisan stores, galleries, art shows, and artisan markets—spaces I revered from a distance until mid-2024. Now I’m part of them!

Beaded Art Display at a Chicagoland Gallery

Beading in particular is how I honor my Ukrainian origins, but the patterns are often inspired by my current home, Chicago. I specialize in loom beading, sourcing often-rare top-quality seed beads—woven together with fishing line. The beads come in iridescent, metallic, matte, and luster finishes. About 2,000 of them per piece create a beautiful gleam.

By now, I see city scenes and artworks in bead colors. When the combination feels right, I make the beading pattern a reality.

And the rest of the time? I’m still living with the love of my life, and every day I get to look out at the beautiful Chicago skyline, including the Sears Tower, from our apartment. In the last half year, we got two best cats and a car (which we’d learned to drive just a month before).

Strawberry (left) and Clunk

Living with chronic illness sucks, and I can’t wait for the new medication approvals I was promised. But if I didn’t have a disability, perhaps being a senior manager would remain at the peak of my dreams. I would’ve missed out on the amazingly welcoming Chicago artist and disabled communities. I would’ve never felt the thrill of someone connecting with my art—that one piece I put hours into, carefully selecting thousands of tiny, sometimes uneven beads with a 5-inch needle.

In February, I’ll be joining my first art gallery exhibit. If you’re in the area, reach out—I hope to see you there. I’m also happy to answer any of your questions via email. And check out more of my art here: yuliyaklochan.com/beaded-art.

When I applied to MIT, it was as a prospective math major and current math enthusiast. Through a long and winding 11-year path, I’m a disabled Chicago artist. I love it.

Memories,Latasha Boyd,2,2025-01-25T00:00:00-05:00,"Hi everyone! I am excited to be back celebrating this milestone with you all. When I left MIT in 2018, I “graduated” with the first class I helped admit. It felt poetic, in a way. I embarked on a new career as a college counselor to give the same advice I loved to give on the blogs. Each of my students heard about finding their puzzle piece and the magic they will bring to any college they choose to attend. However, the more I acclimated to my new community, the louder the whispers in my head became:

“Don’t you think it’s time to leave MIT behind?”

A question I know many blog readers have also struggled with. Do you stop visiting the website at the end of your college application journey? What’s the point of sticking around?



 

My office still has admitted student art from CPWs past on the walls, and a picture of the quad near room 3-108 rested against a window. I predicted with my students when decisions would be released. In the time I have been away, I have still connected with the best admissions team in the world who have become some of my closest friends.

Last spring, I vocalized the whisper to my friends and was met with blank looks. My sense of sacrifice in the name of professional maturity was dismissed. It turned out I was still welcome, and the fence I had been building was unnecessary. My time at MIT was not just a phase, but a foundational thread in my journey that lead me to reflect on my impact in the world and how I love to engage and support students. Just as your time here has helped you reflect on your desires for a campus community that can feel like home as much as the blogs have. I hope that whatever your relationship with MIT has been, that we all are able to maintain our curiosity of the world, sense of adventure, and thirst for knowledge that we nurtured (and can still find) in these pages.

Now that I have seen so many more college campuses (and encourage the wisdom of a balanced college list), I share the magic of Denver sunsets, central Pennsylvania plasma labs, and arctic studies in Maine along with the magic that MIT shared with me.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/HKitty-400x300.jpeg,1
Repilot,Ceri R. '16,21,2025-01-24T00:00:00-05:00,"When we first decided to coordinate 20th anniversary blog posts, I thought I would largely contribute in a behind-the-scenes way, as I do with many projects in my life. While MIT students have IAP in January and take a breather from classes, Admissions Officers are in our seemingly never-ending busy season of reading applications! So it’s not like I don’t have a lot of other work to do right now.

But as I’ve been chatting with former bloggers, queuing their posts, and absorbing their stories, I got the itch to write. And when Celena C ’12 said that she was going to vlog, I got the even stronger itch to make a video.

So, last night, I scrambled to film and edit a vlog for—I think—the first time since undergrad. Special thanks to the 
        one (1) soda I drank with dinner
      
 that powered me through editing, particularly because I was ambitious and filmed B-roll when I came into the office last week, and I didn’t want those clips to go to waste.

In many ways, I have become 
        much more practiced in talking through my thoughts and feelings on the fly (and on mic) in the past decade,
      
 so I’m grateful to have impulsively created a time capsule at this point in my post-yet-kind-of-not-post-MIT journey.

Also, as I captioned and uploaded this vlog, I realized there was one key thing that I forgot to mention in all my monologuing: working with current (and past) bloggers is, by far, my favorite part of my current job. Many of 
        my closest friends from my MIT days
      
 are tied to these blogs in some way, even if we didn’t actually hang out at all when we were students. This is a very special internet community, and I hope you’re enjoying this reunion even a fraction as much as we are.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXa9eNMyRlk,1
Three patterns from the pattern language of my life,Natasha B. '16,12,2025-01-24T00:00:00-05:00,"Hello! It’s about 3,000 days since I graduated from MIT, and three weeks since an even more significant phase change of life, involving a newborn. 

In the 3,000 days, I moved to Washington, D.C. (for a fellowship writing for CityLab, then part of The Atlantic), moved to New Mexico to be near my family, worked as an architectural researcher and urban planner for five years, reconnected with a friend I met on the first day of CPW and married him, and moved across the Atlantic to the other Cambridge to research city-scale planning for shallow geothermal energy and ground source heat pumps. 

In the three weeks, I have mostly just snuggled and fed and changed my baby, grabbed scraps of sleep when possible, and eaten the nice food people have brought to me. Life with a small baby is rich in patterns and scant on plans. A pattern, in the canonical architecture and planning guidebook A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray Silverstein, 

describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our  environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our  environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

The problems: hunger, discomfort, an onslaught of stimulation from the world outside the womb. The solutions: milk, a change, patting, rocking, sleep. Solutions given or applied a million times over, never exactly the same way twice.

Because 3,000 days is a much longer time than three weeks, with a greater variety of patterns, problems, solutions, and events, I’ll account for the eight-plus years since I last blogged in a format inspired by A Pattern Language. A Pattern Language presents all elements or patterns, whether “sacred sites,” “pools and streams,” or “nine percent parking,” in roughly the same format. Each is laid out in this way:

“First, there is a picture, which shows an archetypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture, each pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets the context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps to complete certain larger patterns.” Then three diamonds marking the beginning of the problem; after the diamonds a headline, in bold type; then the body of the problem, including “the empirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its validity, the range of different ways the pattern can be manifested in a building,” and then the solution: “the heart of the pattern–which describes the field of physical and social relationship which are required to solve the stated problem, in the stated context.” The solution is given in the form of an instruction, and often accompanied by a pleasing little squiggly diagram or two. Each pattern chapter concludes with a paragraph outlining its links to the smaller patterns in the language, just as it began with a paragraph linking it to the larger patterns earlier in the book. 

So here are some patterns excerpted from the unwritten idiosyncratic commonplace book of my own last decade. Remember, this is personal and made up! The “solutions” are written as instructions addressed to me, not to the world at large as they are in the real book. If you don’t relate, you can make your own imaginary book, your own preliminary pattern language.

Courtyards

 

…within a site containing one or more BUILDINGS (11), a courtyard may provide a kind of OUTDOOR ROOM (163) that is both private and shared. The courtyard may act as a CEREMONIAL SITE (171) or a LEISURE SPACE (183) for picnicking or sunbathing. In exceptionally good weather, the kinds of activities that normally take place indoors may relocate to the courtyard.

An outdoor space that is open to the sky but enclosed on the sides can be lifeless and blank, or it can be the liveliest part of a site–it depends who is there, where their paths cross through it, and how the ceremony is done.

I graduated in Killian Court in 2016. I don’t remember walking across the stage, but I remember holding up my diploma and smiling while my mother took a photo, opening the diploma book when my sister said “show the diploma!” and looking on in horror five seconds later as a big splotch of bird poop landed on the creamy white cardstock near my name. I remember this because the green splotch is still there, and also because the whole sequence was photographed. Nature keeps me humble.

There’s also a photograph from that day of me and Justin together, which his mother must have taken. We were good friends throughout college (here he is in my blog post from 2014), but hadn’t seen each other much senior year, when we both lived off campus in opposite directions. After graduation, we fell out of touch for a few years until one day he messaged me, and on a whim I invited him to visit me in New Mexico, and he came. That was that, pretty much. Eleven months later we got married in a courtyard of the house my family was living in at the time. Extremely fun. My friend Eden wrote this song as a gift in honor of the day. That courtyard, in a house where some stranger lives now, was the most beautiful one I’ve been in. Sun-baked stucco walls enclosed a rectangle, with heavy wooden doors in the northwest and southeast corners. On the northern wall was a mural that might have been ninety years old, like the house. In the center were a small green octagonal pool with a bubbling fountain and a heavy-limbed apricot tree. Yellow roses bordered the edge of the courtyard by the house, and at the opposite end, a few steps rose up to a small sort of stage, where we had the ceremony. The only bad thing about the courtyard was a stupid little novelty plaque on the far wall that said “on this site in 1897 nothing happened,” which is obviously untrue. Things are always happening.

After the wedding, we moved to Albuquerque, to a funny house shaped like a ‘U.’ The bowl of the U made a kind of informal courtyard, surrounded by the white sides of the house and by the crumbling adobe brick wall that separated us from the gravel road. We set up an outdoor dining table and a pottery wheel in the shade of big elm trees, and when it wasn’t too blistering hot or freezing cold (Albuquerque is a land of extremes) we spent days out there, and sat around with friends in the afternoon.

Cambridge, England, where I am now, is full of courtyards. I have never been in a city with more courtyards per capita, or more grass tennis courts. I’m not saying it’s an efficient use of space, especially considering that many of them are off limits to foot traffic, and are only there to provide a green and well groomed carpet for the empty air above them. I do love the tennis, though. Being a PhD student after years of working and living outside academia is a little like stepping off a public street into a quiet courtyard. The institution around me provides some insulation from the commercial and professional pressures outside, giving me time and space to think hard and slowly and undertake deeper research than I could when I was working a regular job. I want to make the most of it. I’m also aware there is some loss inherent to being too cloistered, and some risk involved in loitering too long in a courtyard, without walking into the buildings around you, or venturing out into the next wider open space. Courtyards are meant to be crossed. 

The entry on courtyards in A Pattern Language is titled not just ‘Courtyards,’ but ‘Courtyards Which Live.” A courtyard can be a perfect gathering place for celebration, or airy room for special pieces of communal life, but to be really alive it must be connected, opening onto a larger area and linked with the intimacy and comfort of the interior spaces adjacent to it.

Therefore:

If you are in a courtyard, physical or metaphorical, be alive. Pay attention to the people there with you, and keep continuity with the larger world and the interior spaces around you.

If you’re lucky enough to have access to a small, pretty courtyard at home or nearby, sit out there and have your coffee as often as possible, and try to keep the plants alive if they’re your responsibility.

 

Cocoons

 

…this pattern provides a respite from the larger patterns of FORWARD MOTION (12) and PUBLIC LIFE (3), nests within SEASONAL FLUCTUATION (17) and HOME (20), and relates to RESTING PLACES (31) and MAINTENANCE (14). Periods of life spent in the COCOON pattern are defined by retreat from outward-facing activities and external achievement and reward, and may be marked by partial employment, introspection, and the absence of frenzy. A good COCOON may not look or feel generative at the time one is in it, but provides a supportive environment for recovery and transformation.

 

 ❖ ❖ ❖

 

At times, it can be helpful to withdraw from regular activity, adopt a slower pace or even step backward, and cocoon.

In 2020, I had a frustrating, stagnating job and family chaos was burning me out. Meanwhile, the pandemic. My husband I moved to Albuquerque and nested hard–planted beans, peppers, and tomatoes, set up eleven chickens in the squat straw-bale coop in the backyard, and rapidly collected an overabundance of Craigslist furniture (later, we saw sense and pared it down). Two of my best friends came to live with us the summer of 2020, and in that period of pre-vaccine uncertainty and social distance, we were lucky to have a house that was lively and safe. When fall came, I quit the job, intending to take a new job I had been offered, but when it came time to commit, I had a strong feeling that the new job was not in fact what I wanted. I took some time to figure out what to do next. I had about a year of underemployment, intermittent freelance projects, spiraling, unspiraling, and planning. I applied to grad programs and started working at a landscape architecture and planning firm I really liked. The year felt long, and I was unsure and sometimes afraid, but in retrospect, it was in some ways a golden time, a rare extended pause. Our house was full of light and barely insulated. For the winter, my husband sewed me a literal cocoon in the form of a housecoat made out of a duvet. 

The slowdown came to an end as my work ramped up and we prepared for the transatlantic move. Our lives since 2022 have been the opposite of contained. The geographic spread, the juggling of my research and writing jobs and Justin’s work and work travel, and the decision to have a baby now rather than waiting have contributed to a welcome level of complexity that is also sometimes difficult. But now, right now, I’m in another little cocoon. My focus on my baby and meeting her needs blurs out everything around us most of the time. I am typing with my right hand only, because my left arm is holding a warm, soft, sleeping weight. 

This won’t last too long, and I believe that ultimately raising a child will expand my life and connections to the world, not contract them. Cocoons are designed to be temporary structures. Two quotes stuck in my head during my pregnancy. One is from James Baldwin, from the potent and historically resonant essay “Notes on the House of Bondage.”

The children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognizing this may be incapable of morality.

The children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognizing this may be incapable of morality.

The other is from the narrator of the novel Season of Migration to the North by Tayeb Salih. 

Everyone starts at the beginning of the road, and the world is an endless state of childhood.

Everyone starts at the beginning of the road, and the world is an endless state of childhood.

Therefore: 

Appreciate the cocoon while you’re in it. The road is wide and long, you’re still near the beginning, your child is at the very very beginning and will exist beyond you into an unfamiliar future. Her world is in its infancy. Our world as a whole is characterized by unremitting change, steady undercurrents and rapids driving movement beneath the surface, and breaks are necessary. To take a break, or make a good cocoon, hunker down in a place as simple and secure as you can find and turn your attention inward. Limit striving, or restrict its range to a single area. Be easy. Make the walls of the cocoon soft and flexible, not too strong. It’s just a seasonal dwelling.

 

❖ ❖ ❖

 

Periods of cocooning are supported by NAP TIME (91), COFFEE AND TEA (100). Immersion in public or personal LIBRARIES (46) may enrich the quality of time spent in the cocoon. SITES SUITABLE FOR SCHEMING AND DAYDREAMING (66) should be identified and fully utilized.

 

Blogs and Letters

 

 …this pattern fulfills the blogger’s need to write and publish. It relates to the larger patterns of LEARNING (7), PUBLIC LIFE (3), and PLACES FOR CONVERSATION (18). 

 

 ❖ ❖ ❖

 

I need to write.

You can take the girl out of MIT, but you can’t take the admissions blogger out of the girl. I’m no longer sitting at a booth in Steam Café at the top of Building 7 filling up notebooks in between classes (and have learned from yesterday’s alum blog posts that Steam no longer exists?), but I’m still a scribbler.

I’m a frequent guest author for the wonderful newsletter Scope of Work. Scope of Work is broadly a platform for writing about the physical world, and a community of people interested in and working in engineering, manufacturing, and infrastructure. My most recent installment, one of my favorites, was about soda ash, the Solvay Process, and the history of glassmaking. 

Before I started writing for Scope of Work, I had a newsletter about buildings, materials, land use, and climate change called Buildingshed. I wrote about stone construction and the architecture in The Age of Innocence, Adrienne Rich’s “Powers of Recuperation” and Mariame Kamara’s work in Niger, and my part-adobe house. Eventually, I let the project lapse, but I have vague and occasional plans to revive it in some way, so if you’re interested, you can subscribe and you may get an email someday.

We’re in newsletter boom times, which is great, but I also miss old-fashioned blogs like these. Ursula K. Le Guin blogged. Lebbeus Woods blogged. I’m compelled by Mandy Brown’s argument for publishing your work on your own site:

 

A website is, among other things, a container. The shape of that container both constrains and makes possible what goes within it. This is, I think, one of the primary justifications for having your own website. Not just so you can own your stuff (for some meaning of “ownership,” in a culture in which any billionaire can scrape your work without permission and copyright only protects the rich). Not just so you have a home base among the shifting winds of the various platforms, which rise and fall like brush before the fire. Not just so you can avoid setting up camp in a Nazi bar. But also so that you can shape the work—so that you can give shape to it, and in that shaping make possible work that couldn’t arise elsewhere.

Therefore:

I’m going to start a blog, and it will live on my website.

Mystery Hunt mile markers,Danny B.D. '15,3,2025-01-24T00:00:00-05:00,"Not only the blogs’ birthday—in trying to decide what to write, I discovered one of my old draft blog posts turned 10. Ten years ago, almost to the day, I was trying to figure out how to tell folks on here what the MIT Mystery Hunt was, and what it was like. Since the youth yearn for the mines content, here’s everything I have from then:

One week ago, early on Sunday morning, I was lying on the floor. I don’t tend to lie on the ground particularly often. Here was my view from the ground facing up: For those of you who haven’t been to campus before, that’s the ceiling of Lobby 7. Lobby 7 is a beautiful space, with that vaulted ceiling and skylight. But why the hell was I on the floor? Let’s try looking over to the side and seeing what’s going on elsewhere. Oh, good. Yeah, that did a lot to clarify any questions you might have had. Fine, fine, I’ll explain. Once a year,

One week ago, early on Sunday morning, I was lying on the floor.



I don’t tend to lie on the ground particularly often. Here was my view from the ground facing up:



For those of you who haven’t been to campus before, that’s the ceiling of Lobby 7. Lobby 7 is a beautiful space, with that vaulted ceiling and skylight. But why the hell was I on the floor?

Let’s try looking over to the side and seeing what’s going on elsewhere.



Oh, good. Yeah, that did a lot to clarify any questions you might have had.

Fine, fine, I’ll explain. Once a year,

And that’s where I stopped my draft, mid-sentence. Thank you, me-from-2015.

Let me try that again.

Once a year, thousands of people (MIT-affiliated and not!) descend onto MIT’s campus over the long MLK weekend each January, and begin bashing their collective skulls against puzzles of any and all forms. This is the MIT Mystery Hunt: an annual event which changes in shape and size every year, in part because it’s always written by the team which finishes first the prior year: a combination honor/curse which means we’ll never see the same theme or hunt twice. It’s a time of seeing friends, and learning esoterica, and putting arcane things in spreadsheets, and not sleeping very much. There are other puzzle hunts (in-person and online) scattered throughout the year, but the MIT Mystery Hunt sits atop the calendar at just a whole other scale.

Hunt’s been covered on the blogs many, many, many times before, and also just got a lovely writeup in Technology Review. When I started that draft, though, I didn’t have a grasp of how important Hunt would be in my life. 2015 was my third hunt: my first year we actually won, so my second year we wrote (I helped with runtime stuff), and that third year, with that blog post draft, was only the second time I’d ever been an actual participant.

Fast forward a decade: our team continues to chug along, picking up current undergrads, recent alumni, various friends nearby and across the globe. We have members with graduation years predating other members’ birth years. I slowly learned more about how puzzles work and how to solve them—as of yet, despite having a few ideas (and despite having been on the writing team in 2014), I still haven’t taken a crack at writing any of my own. I’ve stuck with this team through increasingly unhinged team names, became one of the core people running our tech stack for puzzle management, and gotten a gnarly scar on my leg which could be a shark bite but is really just because I pulled an all-nighter in 2017 and then collided with a stone bench on the final runaround.

When I lived in San Francisco for 6 years, Hunt was the temporal landmark which anchored at least one of my trips back to see friends in the Boston area. It was one of those visits, feeling a wind-chill-in-the-teens January evening, which made me realize I really needed to move back: if I could miss New England in those conditions, I wasn’t just coating the climate with nostalgia. I did move back, and now I’m delighted that I get to now help shelter other friends who make an annual pilgrimage for this silly, silly weekend.

I started seeing someone new in early January 2022, and a week or two later I had to explain that I was going to vanish all weekend into this weird “hunt” thing. She was very understanding—but she did text me Saturday that she had just made fresh-baked cookies… so I ducked out of puzzling briefly, because I liked her an awful lot, and also, fresh-baked cookies. We got married at City Hall a month ago.

Hunt is a weekend of escapism in a bleak winter month, bringing together thousands of ridiculous dorks who are ready willing and able to do utterly ridiculous things. The memorable (positive) parts of hunts are the ones which spark wonder, chaos, silliness. You hide flash drives inside donuts, ask people to construct preposterous fashion, twitch play escape rooms, build a goddamn puzzle bed. Even small dashes of whimsy make it go from a list of puzzles to magic. The joys of frantically searching around like you cracked a conspiracy theory. This year, in particular, Death & Mayhem wrote a hunt which knocked it out of the park. I’m still sitting in awe.

It’s my purest form of holiday I can get: a weekend where my brain is filled with joy and trivia and friendship, and I have no room to worry about the omnishambles. I love all types of puzzles in a hunt, but when I think about what it means for it to be MIT’s Mystery Hunt in particular, it doesn’t mean the puzzles must be fundamentally impossible, or the hunt must set records in size or length. It means using the physical environment, collocated on campus for a weekend, to do things, which are limited only by what the writing team decides to do, not by hunters’ willingness to do them.

And so the countdown to Hunt’s kickoff on January 16, 2026 begins anew, complete with new challenges, and new memories.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-11.49.48%E2%80%AFPM-400x535.png

Ten Years (On Dreams),"Lydia K. '14, MEng '16",12,2025-01-23T00:00:00-05:00,"2020: Ten years since high school

What is your name?

Lydia Andreyevna Krasilnikova.

Where do you live now?

Cambridge, MA, USA.

What is your occupation or field that you work in?

I am a computational biologist. I study infectious disease and disease outbreaks. I also draw space cows and occasionally write articles about scientist culture.

What are some life events that have occurred? (marriage, children, education, achievements, etc.)

I got my SB and MEng and am currently working on my PhD. My partner Cory and I have been together for almost nine years now. We met in college (lived in the same dorm). He’s a mechanical engineer. No kids (yet).

What is one unusual experience you have had since graduating from State High?

Teaching was weird. One of my first times reserving a room for office hours I waited way too late and the room I got was a special room above the Museum. I got a message saying I would need to pick up a key. When I came by to pick up the key the person in charge was flustered and very confused, told me I wasn’t supposed to have been able to reserve that room at all, and finally said I could have the room just for this week but that I and my students were not to eat anything while in the room and that we were absolutely not allowed to touch anything. Anyway, it turned out to be the human specimens room. It was full of skeletons, human skeletons and skeletons of human-like primates, and skulls on shelves behind glass, and stacked little cardboard boxes that I can only assume contained more bones. (In addition, the lights were automatic and apparently I don’t move that much because they kept turning off.) No students showed up to office hours that week.

***

High school was a magical time. I was obsessed with the radio, and I carried around a little wind-up Grundig. I knew all the stations in our town, and in the neighboring towns, and I vividly remember the staticky morning talk show wake-ups and the smell of the wet morning air in the early autumn and the hope I had for every single day. I knew all the genres of stations, and I thought I knew all the genres of people. I dressed in mostly all black, with one non-black color at a time, ostensibly to show everyone I was hardcore but secretly because I had no idea how to match colors. I ruined all my textbooks by pressing leaves between the pages. I was always late, especially to first period, and I got a decent chunk of my best studying done in detention and Saturday school with my favorite math teacher. I learned that authority figures can let you down, and that other people, including some trustworthy adults, can open doors for you and make your dreams possible. I wasn’t yet grateful for nor understood the preciousness of their consistently showing up for me (even as I did not not consistently show up to, well, anything). I unquestioningly thought I could do anything I wanted to do—which to me meant, ultimately, getting into MIT, leading to some unknown secure future, the vision or meaning of which I hadn’t thought through at all (other than, of course, an MIT boyfriend). I hadn’t yet experienced or learned about sexism—or xenophobia, or racism, or imposter syndrome, or the sadder sides of immigration, or most bad things (and I don’t think I would have gotten as far as I have if I had). As far as I knew, I was smart and hardworking and if I decided to do something it got done.

Things that would surprise then me about current me:

- That radio plays much less of a part in my life.

- And kayaking, and camping and hiking.

- That, ten years out of high school, and having graduated from MIT, I live with roommates in a not-fancy apartment.

- That I still don’t usually feel that I belong, and that the weird awkwardness I felt in classrooms of older or cooler students never fully went away (and maybe was never about age).

- That I actually did pull it off, all of it.

If twelve-year-old me, lying on the carpet of her second-story bedroom at 11pm switching between homework and calling friends on the light tan corded phone (yes, actually) and obsessively refreshing the MIT Admissions blogs, could see me, I think, she would be beyond thrilled, floored, some kind of astonished. I achieved most of her dreams. I got into MIT. I blogged for MIT Admissions, which was my browser homepage and obsession (obsession) from ages 12 through 18. I don’t think I can overstate what a big deal that would have been to her. (People even read my writing! Sometimes a lot of people, and sometimes a lot.) I finished a double major that sounds like a triple major. I got an MEng. I got my MIT boyfriend.

Writing it out, it sounds ridiculous. I even got into Harvard for grad school after MIT, which I hadn’t even bothered to imagine. I even wrote for Technology Review, not once but multiple times, in print (my own name, in a byline, in print)—the same magazine a younger me was utterly entranced by at an alum family friend’s parents’ house, the very origin of the foundation for the future self that I spent the next half-decade carefully planning and imagining and singularly working toward. I was even on TV. I was even on the cover of a newspaper. It all happened.

I am not the person I think I thought I would be, nor am I anymore the person who imagined her. I’m steadier, I hope, and my risks are more measured, which may or may not be a good thing. I have thinner skin and a softer shell. I care deeply, far too deeply, about what people think of me—not just the clothes and the music, but my academic accomplishments and my mind and my career. I’m far less confident, even as I’ve progressed academically, even as I’ve gotten far more comfortable around people and inside my own body. I’ve disappointed a lot of people whose opinions I care about, including myself—something that just wasn’t possible back then. I’m more concerned about other people in general, and not just in a bad way. I’m kinder to my body. I’m more concerned about balance.

Sometimes I wonder what that younger me, the designer, the true me, as she seems to be in my head, would do with the opportunities and challenges I have. I wish I could transplant her into my mind for a week, either to take the lead on my work or to sit back and critique. What would she think of my PhD so far? She’d probably work far harder, or at least with more focus, with absolutely no self-doubt. She probably wouldn’t hesitate or wait for permission or approval. Would she be a better self-advocate? Would she be unshakable in pursuing her goals? Would she speak up more aggressively for her ideas, and do a better job of asking for resources to carry them out?

Clearly the thing I miss, really really miss, about the person I used to be is her assured, steady confidence, or at least what I remember as assured, steady confidence. Where did it come from? Supportive parents? A stable, comfortable home and academic life? Mostly supportive teachers, at least in the subjects that mattered? Easier, less open-ended day-to-day tasks with tangible goals and endpoints? Did it come from not having yet experienced a pileup of history of failure? a lack of exposure to criticism? not yet having experienced or named sexism and the various usual injustices? Was it just a quality of being a teenager, some level of blindness to failure or criticism—social skills sufficiently underdeveloped to not notice or care about anyone’s opinion of me or have my own real opinion or awareness of myself? Did I simply not have an awareness of the distance between myself and the person I wanted to be? Or was the person I wanted to be sufficiently vague or shrouded in distant adulthood to be beyond comparison? Did being a child make my shortcomings easier for me to accept? Or was it perhaps something more positive: a healthier attitude about failure, or something that gave me the perspective to not be wobbled by it? Was it the constant, hovering presence of a professional goal that reached beyond any one person or subgoal, large enough and far enough away that it could be reached by wiggling around any steps I missed? Was it my many, many hobbies, giving me something other than my career to invest my heart into? Was it the presence and support of family and friends who I felt truly knew me?—in which case, was it the ability to talk through setbacks or negative experiences or my perception of another person’s judgement, again and again and again, to several separate people? or was it the knowledge that here, in this place where I am safe, are people who love me, even knowing me? Perhaps knowing that there are people who consistently see me and consistently love me cause feeling otherwise unloved or unseen to become bearable, any other person’s opinion or moods not quite as important. Or is the problem with self-worth during a PhD the concentration of responsibility for evaluation into a far smaller number of people, sometimes just one, often for an entire six years? In that case, it should be important to de-densify that authority—introduce more mentors, more authority figures, preferably some of them supportive to balance out any overweighed trauma from the others.

One idea that has been causing me particular dissonance is that high school me seemed to have time for everything. She filled up the school day with nonstop classes, cramming more classes where there were supposed to be study halls or lunch periods, missing a few days a week of easier classes to cram even more classes in where they already literally couldn’t fit. But I don’t remember homework or classes being my whole life, or even most of it. My memories are mostly in between classes (gossiping, so much gossiping, holding hands, making out in the hallway—horrifyingly embarrassing to think of now) or, especially, before and after school. A lot of my social life was in Science Olympiad—more gossiping, learning to use power tools (and hot glue and gorilla glue and gorilla tape), building tiny cars and water clocks and wooden airplanes I was so proud of—, starting in eighth grade and ending in eleventh, when I left high school. I was obsessed (obsessed) with getting the team to Nationals (I didn’t—we didn’t, and I cried on the last bus ride home from States). I kayaked multiple days a week and most of the weekend many weekends, especially in the not-freezing seasons. On top of that my family went on near constant adventures, skiing and biking and hiking and weekend camping trips around Pennsylvania. I also remember long nights coding personal projects, working on my first attempt(s) at a blog, trying to learn to sew clothes, baking experiments like that handful of times I made phyllo dough from scratch. And then my obsession with photography, going on what I called photography expeditions, then spending hours and hours editing photos of butterflies or trees or sunsets or the moon and adding a color-coordinated border and uploading to deviantART and talking with strangers online about my photographs and their photographs and about photography in general. And, of course, constantly AIM-ing with my friends, dissecting and analyzing crushes and homework and teachers and goals—this not including the hour a day dedicated to phone calls with boyfriends or prospective boyfriends or the time spent vaguely hanging out/loitering on school property or playing hide-and-seek tag after dark on Fridays in the park on the way home from school (that and another form of tag on the actual playground equipment right when it got just dark enough for someone to get injured on playground equipment but yet not dark enough to make hide-and-seek extra spooky).

There definitely wasn’t actually enough time: I cut class or slept through class or got sick and missed class constantly, at least once a week, which must have been an awful rollercoaster for my parents and a ridiculous mess for my teachers to watch and try to grapple with year after year after year. I would pull all-nighters to get work done, only to fall asleep and miss class and not turn in the work I did anyway. Then turn work in late; then probably fall behind, though I don’t actually remember ever being behind. Then do it again. (The trick was to get into just enough trouble to get Saturday school, rather than several far less productive detentions, but not enough trouble to warrant an even less productive in-school suspension.)

And yet I remember this time, and my time at MIT right after it, as remarkably productive, even though I definitely spent far more time on things that are not my job than I do now. Which is too bad—it seems I am working harder, but far less effectively, perhaps because I am working harder.

So here are some action items, borrowed from a happy childhood, to cultivate well-earned self-confidence for a better, less traumatizing, perhaps even empowering PhD/current career stage experience—maybe even a better, less traumatizing career overall.

- Choose your mentors carefully. Have several, meet with them regularly, and solicit feedback. If your current career stage is structured such that you get feedback from only one person, or only one person’s feedback matters to your career, acquire additional mentors and do your best to dilute that one person’s power over you (even if they are supportive and that power feels like a good thing).

- Develop a larger goal that reaches far beyond your current career stage—far enough away that a failure now or loss of support from any one person could be wiggled around to still reach the larger goal through another path.

- Have family and/or friends who you feel truly and consistently see you, and truly and consistently love you for exactly who you are. Talk with those people often, and do the same for them.

- Have hobbies that are important to you and give you fulfillment that is completely separate from your primary career.

- Make (substantial) time for your hobbies and family and friends. Don’t cut them out because you think you will get more work done. You won’t, apparently. Work less.

- Make good friends at work/in your lab to make the whole thing more bearable and hopefully even fun, at least sometimes. Spend more time talking with people, and listening to people, and being friendly.

- Remember your younger self, who would be so proud of who you are and how far you have come.

Update: my favorite math teacher, who presided over Saturday school, has informed me that apparently while I did have Saturday school sometimes, I mostly showed up voluntarily, just for fun, to sit and work and be focused. (What a nerd.)

As I write this I am at home, in the living room. The living room is where I spend most of my waking hours. It’s small. It’s got a futon, a TV, shelves with Legos and books, a fancy coffee table we got off the street in Cambridge, and cute bar stools that look like burnt marshmallows facing the countertop that connects the living room and the kitchen. Almost a year later we’re still not completely unpacked, but the living room is the room we perfected first.

As I write this I am sitting on the Orange Line. I get on at the end of the line and I get off at the other end of the line, and then in the evenings I do the same thing in reverse. We’re nearing the end of the line, and the train is clearing out. From the outside the Orange Line train looks like a giant bug, something wormy and segmented.

As I write this I am sitting at my desk at work, during my union-mandated break. I work at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, for the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences. My chair is a comfortable spinny chair and my desk can set itself to any height (sometimes even a height I am interested in it setting itself to). There are no personal effects on my desk or pinned to the walls of my cubicle, but that’s because I’m new here and I take the train, and personal effects are hard to take on the train. I sit next to the arbovirus team, which I like because I get to hear about their adventures collecting ticks all over Massachusetts. I myself don’t go on adventures for work, but I like being around people who do. In grad school I was in a department for zoology and botany and evolution, which meant that most of my peers spent summers hunting down frogs or ferns or a specific species of flower.

My side of grad school was evolution: specifically, viral evolution, which can be used to trace a virus as it moves from person to person and mutates along the way. I study disease outbreaks using the genomes of the pathogens at fault. (You know how you can sequence the human genome? We sequence everything in you that isn’t human.) In my day-to-day I write code, I do statistics and make graphs, I organize and attend meetings, and I write and read papers. Today, I am working on a subtype classification system for the virus I’m currently focusing on (no spoilers!), but today is an unusual day. Most days I analyze outbreaks of that virus: I’m looking to learn how far it spread, whom it spread through, and how well contact tracing, vaccination, and other interventions worked. I’ve been analyzing outbreaks like this one for about a decade, starting during my MEng at MIT and then through my PhD. The job stays interesting: I get to jump around from pathogen to pathogen, and the things we can do with pathogen genomes get cooler every year.

I also write and draw. I am now, finally, writing fiction. I’m on the third draft of my first novel, which is a ghost story about mortgages set in Salem on Halloween. (It’s a weird combo. Wish me luck.) I wrote it largely on my phone on the train, which I’m pretty proud of.

Here’s a timeline of my career:

- 2006-2010: high school, the last year of which I spent at Penn State taking classes mostly in computer science and writing

- 2010-2016: MIT undergrad (6-7/18, or computational biology and math, with a minor in 21W, or writing) and master’s in engineering (6-7), during which time I lived in Random Hall, blogged, and met the love of my life

- 2016-2017: listless but pivotal gap year working in the same lab where I did my master’s (the iconic Sabeti Lab), during which time a guy I shared an office with decided to apply to grad school, in response to which, on the last day to register for the biology GRE, I followed our PI to the airport and pitched myself applying too

- 2017-2023: PhD at Harvard (same lab) in the department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology

- 2023-2024: postdoc at the Broad Institute (same lab)

- 2024-present: Massachusetts Department of Public Health (now collaborating with that same lab)

And here’s a timeline of where I’ve lived:

- 2006-2010: an absolutely idyllic two-story house with a big yard (the room over the garage was my room) in State College, Pennsylvania, with my parents and my little brother Max

- 2010-2015: Random Hall, on BMF, with two windows looking out at a very precious tree

- 2015-2021: a fourth-floor, two-bedroom apartment between MIT and Harvard with a tiny kitchen, a shower that took ten minutes to heat up, an ever-rotating cast of roommates (all friends from MIT or friends of friends from MIT), and breathtaking views of Harvard rooftops (nice, pointy spires) silhouetted against the sunset

- 2021-2024: the third floor of our friend PJ’s house in Salem, PJ being one of our best friends since Random Hall and Salem being as much about the ocean as it is about witches, which surprised me

- 2024-present: our very own house, in Malden, a town north of Boston and south of Salem, with us on the second and third floors and one of Cory’s best friends since high school, Robert, in the first-floor apartment

The house was the best we could do in the circumstances, those circumstances being Boston housing costs and me tanking my earnings by going to grad school over and over again. (Highly recommend, but from what I’ve heard it’s unlikely I will ever catch up financially to my friends who did not go to grad school.) The house is very old and it has a lot of doors. (The first floor kitchen holds the record at five doors.) Cory is a mechanical engineer, so he fixes and builds things. I paint things and make phone calls. So far we have fixed up the first and third floors, and we are slowly working on the second floor as we live in it. But that is all small: sometime in the spring we are having the front porch rebuilt because it is falling off the house and we are having the structural beams that hold up the house swapped out for new ones for similarly good reasons. We have a plumbing and electrical loan, a maxed-out (temporarily interest-free) credit card, and a construction loan almost the size of another down payment. I like to brag about our debt, but this was our secret strategy: buy a huge house no one else will bid on at a price we can afford, then get it livable before the plan falls in on itself like a house of cards. I’ll let you know later if the gamble was good.

I don’t have a lot to complain about. I have a family that loves me whom I love back, I have good friends who have stuck with me through hard times, I have an entire house (which is technically two entire houses), I have four cities that feel like home (Boston, State College, Myrtle Beach, and Key Largo), I have a tuxedo kitten who thinks I’m his mother, I have a job that I love with people I like, I got to go to Harvard for grad school (a reach goal from undergrad), I got to go to MIT (my dream since I was 12), and I’m engaged (engaged!) (to the MIT engineer I dreamed of finding since probably about the same age). No dream has come close to my dream of going to MIT. Nothing has ever felt as bright as that. But I want to have kids, I want to be able to afford to fix up our house and get Cory a new (used) car, and I want to be a published fiction author. Someday, once everything is paid for, I’d like to buy and fix up more Malden two-families. (I’m learning way too much and having way too much fun with this one not to do it all again.)

I want to say that my hopes for my future today don’t feel as sparkly as my dreams felt in high school—specifically my dream of getting into MIT. Maybe it’s because I’m older, maybe it’s because I spent some time listless, maybe it’s because I’m content. But why would I say that? Getting engaged felt good, uniquely good. I think having kids would feel good in a unique way, too. I’ve wanted to write fiction for as long as I wanted to go to MIT (longer, even), so maybe getting a book deal would feel just as good. And I think really liking the state of my home and having a modern car and having everything paid off would feel like relief and stability.

I don’t know what I thought my post-MIT dreams would look like. Change the world for the better, first and foremost? An easy checkmark—I’m lucky that my day job does that. Get rich? A more challenging checkmark, given that day job, and with wealth defined as stability. (I think if you can stably afford a house and kids in the greater Boston area and go out to restaurants and buy expensive lattes at fancy local coffee shops and travel for vacations, you’re pretty rich.) Get famous? Never famous enough to be recognized, but as famous as seeing my name on some of the books at Hudson News when I fly (I’m terrified of flying, but I think if my name was on books sold at airports I’d like it quite a bit more.) and people seeing my name on a talk or a paper in public health, recognizing it, and thinking it’s probably a good talk or paper (and I’d also, in this fantasy world, like for that thought to be true).

It’s not MIT, but is it a dream? Do I need a dream?

I don’t have an answer to that question. My twenties have turned into my thirties and while I don’t have a guiding North Star, I do have goals and hopes. Here’s what I’m grappling with: without a defining dream, my work still has purpose and my life still has meaning. Is that enough? Is it enough to do good work and to be content? In high school, it was easy to find something big to reach for. Is there a parallel in adulthood, for me?

2015: Ten years ago today

As I write this I would have been in Random Hall, on BMF, at my desk with the door open to the long hallway joining the back stairwell and the two donut-shaped (if you look down from above, which few people do) buildings, which gave me an excellent view of anyone coming or going. In January 2015 I would have been halfway through the first year of my MEng. I would have been gearing up to TA my second semester of 6.005 (which later became 6.031), and I would have just joined the Sabeti Lab with no idea it would be my home for the next decade.

These were the beginnings of the listless years. A PhD was on the horizon, maybe. A job was on the horizon, maybe. I didn’t know where I was going and I certainly did not have a plan. My biggest dream thus far, MIT, was coming to a close, and I didn’t have a replacement. And ten years older, ten years more content, ten years happier, I still don’t have a replacement.

Things that would surprise then me about current me:

- That most of what I worked hardest and longest on didn’t end up mattering except as an educational exercise, while some of the things that mattered most came together in a matter of months.

- That every big career step since MIT has been something I stumbled into, not something I thought through deeply and worked toward over years.

- When it happened I don’t know, but in every place I go, I do feel, resoundingly, like I belong.

- That I never did figure it out, whatever it was I was hoping I would figure out.

- That I am happier every year.

And, based on that, some action items:

- Nothing matters and everything matters—or rather, you have no idea what is going to end up mattering, so do your best at everything but don’t get hung up on anything.

- Set yourself up to do good work that you are proud of.

- Be open to the opportunities that come your way.

- Be content to be content.

- Remember your younger self, who would be so proud of who you are and how far you have come.

Back then, I couldn’t have known I would become dreamless—happy, busy, doing good things, but dreamless. An MEng is not technically supposed to be two years long, and a person isn’t supposed to spend 14 years mostly within a two-mile radius, but I wanted to stick around MIT for as long as I could. Who wouldn’t? I was exactly where I wanted to be. I was home.

Full Circle,Anna H. '14,5,2025-01-23T00:00:00-05:00,"I’m sitting on the floor of my living room in Ithaca, New York. It’s snowing outside and the windows are cloudy with condensation. A couple of days ago I got back from Ireland, where I gave a seminar and served as the external examiner (“extern”) for a PhD Viva, and now I’m trying to get my act together before the semester starts on Tuesday. 

The last time I wrote a blog post was July 2020, when I had just defended my own PhD. There’s a coda to that story. Over a decade ago (!), when I was an undergrad at MIT, I got a book in the mail from an author I nicknamed “Shakespeare.” The book was about astronomy research at an observatory in the 1960s, and I ended up doing my graduate work at the same observatory. After my PhD defense, I mailed the author a hard copy of my dissertation, along with a letter describing all the exciting new science happening at the observatory. I wasn’t expecting a response, so when I entered my office and saw a letter from Shakespeare lying on my desk, I opened it without sitting down or taking off my backpack. The letter was in blue ink on very thin, soft, cream-colored paper. “Dear Anna,” it read, “One handwritten note deserves another.” He said he remembered sending me that book while I was at MIT, that it had been his first book, and that at the time he had no idea if he could actually write a book, but that the encouragement and respect of others helped get him there. 

Today I’m writing as a professor of astronomy. In between, I spent a couple of years as a postdoc, where I spent the vast majority of my time doing research. The transition from being a postdoc to being a faculty member was the most abrupt of my career because it came with the most new responsibilities: I teach undergraduate and graduate classes, fundraise and manage a budget for a research program, supervise a group of postdocs and students, and serve on departmental committees. I had done bits and pieces of each before, but the shift in scale was dramatic. I knew that it would be: when I solicited advice before my move, I was told that “nobody [is ever ready for a faculty position] because the demands are impossible,” and that I should define my own goals–in other words, decide which aspects of the job I wanted to excel at, because no one could excel at all of them. 

So, the job is not easy, but it’s deeply rewarding in many respects. I feel genuine excitement about learning how the universe works–a feeling that has not changed at all since I was an undergrad–and I’ve learned that this is precious, a flame to protect from burning out. I get to study the cosmos with students and postdocs who amaze me with their individual talents and their generosity with one other. My first undergraduate mentee recently graduated, and went off to get her PhD; I stuck the program from her commencement to the wall of my office. I have regulars at office hours whose interest in the subject reignites my own. I work with people from all over the world. 

Looking over my MIT blogs now, I’m struck by how many threads have continued–the things I enjoy, the way I approach challenges–and also by how the perspective has flipped. Instead of being the undergrad whose eyes are glazing over in lecture because she stayed up until 6am doing way too many activities, I’m the professor who sees a student’s eyes glaze over while I’m lecturing and feels retrospective embarrassment at how obvious inattention is to the person at the front of the room. (To all my former professors, I would just like to say: I’m sorry. I thought you might not be able to tell.) Instead of scrambling to find a research position, I receive emails from students and although I do my best to respond, I sadly don’t have the bandwidth to work with all of them, and hope that my unavailability is not discouraging. Instead of being in a panicked state about choosing classes and a major, I meet with students who are making the same decisions. I remember my first conference, and now I send students to that same conference and hope that the environment is just as welcoming. I remember how it felt to write my first observing proposal, and this summer I took my students out to ice cream to celebrate their first proposal success, with the same telescope. 

A favorite high school teacher once told me that it was important “always to find [one’s] points of equilibrium.” An academic career often entails moving: in the past decade I’ve lived in five very different places, spanning what has felt to me like at least three different phases of life. In each phase, equilibrium has had a different meaning: I’ve seen my needs and priorities change, and I know that they will change again in the next few years. I was nervous about moving to Ithaca, and the beginning was difficult, but I knew that things would rebalance. Sure enough, I made friends, signed up for many mailing lists (which reminded me a lot of moving to MIT!), joined a choir, started taking singing lessons, and found a volunteering role at Cornell’s Lab of Ornithology–it just took some time. 

Birds have always been a latent interest, and after moving here I particularly wanted to see owls. About a year ago, during the area’s annual bird count, I met someone who knew the owl guy. She gave me a name (let’s call him Bill) and a phone number, and said to text him. I texted Bill asking if I could tag along, and his instructions were to meet him at the Lab of Ornithology north parking lot at 3:45am. So that’s how I found myself bundled up in the back of a stranger’s car at the crack of dawn on New Year’s Day. We heard 14 Eastern screech owls, and saw 3 of them. They are tiny and very adorable. 

The sun has pretty much set, so I’ll wrap up here. Thank you to Ceri and Chris for organizing the blog anniversary and see you all in…(yikes…)…ten years?

Hi again (and goodbye),Elizabeth Choe '13,4,2025-01-23T00:00:00-05:00,"When Petey messaged the blogger alums about coming back and posting for the 20th anniversary of the blogs, I originally hadn’t planned on writing anything. And that is because while everyone else has been checking in from all corners of the world and sharing the many adventures post-MIT life has taken them on, I, uh, never actually left MIT. 

See, after graduating from Course 20 in 2013, I ran an educational media outreach program in MIT Open Learning for a few years (working with Ceri!) while doing some independent video production on the side. Then I came “back home” to Admissions, helping to run these very blogs with Petey while also working at the MIT Media Lab’s then-called Learning Initiative. In 2018, I started my PhD in Course 20. Just the other week I had a lovely lunch with Ceri, Petey, rfong, and Danny in the schmancy new Admissions building. Bryan is now a professor in Course 20 who I saw every week for the past 6 years. I have lived in the 01239 zip code for almost half of my life. MY 
        KERBEROS
      
 HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS. Honestly, what is there to catch up on?

The catching up is that I finally left MIT and started a new gig leading science communications for an oncology-and-AI research group at a big biotech company a few months ago. But I don’t think it’ll feel real until May, when, by some poetic stroke of coincidence, I both walk across the graduation stage, bidding official adieu to the place that raised me (and my Kerb finally expires), and I also get married and really start life sans MIT. Truth is, I have been a bit in emotional denial over the whole thing, and as I messaged Petey, “I am reluctant to write because I am afraid of what will come out of me. Lol.” How do I distill the last 15 years into one farewell post? 

Let’s start with the easy things, the stuff that hasn’t changed: 

- I still have a penchant for dramatic flair (I wrote two farewell posts on these blogs before and look how that turned out. I still live within walking distance of MIT. I am doing Just Fine™). 

- I am still a perfectionist (as evidenced by the number of times I have started, scrapped, and restarted this post). 

- The Student Center, despite having a dramatic interior renovation last year (losing Verdes and Anna’s! RIP), still kind of has that weird smell???

And yet, so much else has changed: 

- My freshman year, I converted to Catholicism after growing up atheist and the Tech Catholic Community became one of the most important communities of my undergrad experience. My first year of grad school, I left the Church and the Addir Interfaith Fellows program became my community of meaning, ritual, and service during my PhD. Though I’m no longer religious, the most precious thing that came out of these groups was experiencing what it means to be held and hold others in community and collective care. And for that, my formerly super-individualistic self is very grateful.

- My sophomore year of undergrad, homesick and missing my then-7-year-old brother, I filled out transfer applications in my Simmons dorm room. The heads of house at the time, John (a Course 20 professor) and Ellen, convinced me to stay. I gave myself another year. And then another. And… the years (and subsequent hours in John’s office working through career decisions, breakups, deaths) passed by… Eight years later I moved back into Simmons as a Graduate Resident Advisor and spent the next five years supporting undergrads through grad school applications, heartbreak, and grief. I really had to learn how to listen, to sit in someone’s joy and pain, and to navigate the problems in the life that aren’t easily solvable, which are all things that MIT very much did not teach me how to do, but are skills I am glad to have learned, given that I was kind of an asshole when I first got here. (Oh, also, my then-7-year-old brother graduated from college this past year.) 

- In early 2014, a staff member, comparing MIT to smaller liberal arts colleges, reflected to me that “MIT is not really an activist campus.” Later that year, Michael Brown was killed by a police officer a couple hours east of my hometown, spurring the national Black Lives Matter movement. It was the first time I saw student protests on campus. When I first came to MIT, I did not think much about my identity beyond someone who was good at school, I did not think much about problems beyond the ones that were in my p-sets, and I assumed institutions operated in the interest of the people they served. I can’t condense this shift—mine or campus’s—into a few sentences, but I will say that watching current students (and staff and faculty) grapple with the world as their whole selves, no matter how imperfectly, has changed me in ways that I hope will only grow.  

- Before I got to MIT, I was impressed by achievement and power. As a freshman, I watched with awe as the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research was built. A decade later, I joined that same institute as a PhD student and shortly afterward, a few Big Bummers happened: 1) Jeffrey Epstein was arrested for heinous crimes that, despite some being public knowledge, people at MIT overlooked to accept his money and influence. 2) High-profile faculty I once admired were fired or placed on leave for various forms of trainee abuse. 3) I came to understand who David Koch was, how he and his brother made the fortune that funded much of MIT—including the very building I worked in—and how profoundly misaligned their values were with my own. Grad school was a time to reckon with the qualities I once lionized. I now believe smart people are everywhere, and intellect is fairly unextraordinary. What’s far more remarkable is when, despite all the forces that push you otherwise, people are humble, generous, patient, empathetic, self-aware, or genuine, and when they do the right thing even if no one’s watching.

- 
Like many of the blogger alums, I got into running in my 30s, racked up a collection of chronic and invisible illnesses (and ADHD!!!), and honestly *wildly waves hands* can we get an epidemiological study on us?? (But for real, all this taught me to not assume how other people go through life, and also, damn, MIT student health insurance is actually really good. That might be what I miss the most???)

- 
From childhood, I thought being smart was mutually exclusive with everything else about me, and that if I wanted to be taken seriously in the professional world, I had to be literally serious and kind of a hard-ass (which, to a certain extent, is true). It took me a long time to realize that the friends I made at MIT didn’t value me because I was smart, but because I was a silly-ass mofo who makes people giggle. Kind of sad, but honestly? Having the MIT credentials freed me up to lean into the rest of who I am. Post-undergrad, I was in my feminine era. And now post-grad, I’m in my silly era, letting some tempered version of a rowdier, spirited me exist in lots of spaces, including work (where I am one of the few extroverts in a sea of introverted data scientists, which, if MIT has prepared me for anything, it is this).

MIT—I hated it. I loved it. I couldn’t wait to get out. I stayed for 15 years. It changed me forever. I’m forever grateful.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-at-11.11.59-AM-800x597.png

Don’t forget to check in with yourself,Jenny X. '13,13,2025-01-23T00:00:00-05:00,"When I think about my time at MIT, my first thought is: it still feels like just yesterday (I graduated in 2013). Last year, I had the chance to walk through campus, down the infinite, with my 9-month old baby — and it all still felt like home. 

Okay, all the places I loved to eat at are gone (RIP Shinkansen, Steam Cafe, Cafe 4…are food trucks still a thing? Someone let me know in the comments 😉); my favorite Hayden Library got a modern makeover; there are multiple brand new buildings changing views forever (looking at you, Music Building; also MIT Nano is very cool to peer into). But! I still have so many specific MIT memories I’ll delight in for the rest of my life, probably in part because many of my closest friends are still those I met at MIT (including my husband), and there are just a whole lot of stories to reminisce about and tell over and over again among us. I am so grateful for this. 



When I think about my blogs on here, the post I think about the most is: “Be yourself or create yourself?” The contrast in the title is a catchy way to describe the challenge of growing as a person, but I’ve since learned that it’s a false dichotomy… because 1) it doesn’t have to be one or the other, and 2) it’s not a one-time decision. 

These days, I instead regularly ask, “What do I want?” What do I want to be, to do, to give attention to? It sounds like a simple question but it can get harder to answer over time because first you have to make time to pause and interrogate yourself and when you finally manage to, you have to be really, really honest. Still, I find it an interrogation worth going through, again and again. 

After graduating (as an architecture major plotting to become a writer), I went into journalism for almost 10 years — until 2022, when I was able to take a 6-month sabbatical of sorts. During this period, I was fortunate to enjoy slow mornings, frequent walks around the neighborhood, and yes, a lot of time to ask, what do I want? 

Long story short, on the job front, I decided to pivot into UX writing/content design (words and storytelling for digital products essentially, which sort of makes sense in terms of combining my writing and design backgrounds). I really enjoy the work and want to keep going in this discipline. But job aside, I’ve also distilled what I want to spend time and attention on into these three things, from the actionable to the abstract:

- I want to write, read, draw/paint. 

- I want to create antidotes to noise. 

- I want to live intentionally and help others do the same. 

The specifics of what I do or the path from here on out and the timing of it all… I don’t know! But it feels good to clarify the general direction (at least for this particular phase of my life/version of myself). Currently, I do a lot of thinking/writing/exploring on those bullet points in my Substacks, most regularly on Ode, a newsletter about shopping with intention and building a fulfilling wardrobe. A recent post on a dozen ways to stop wanting to buy clothes all the time resonated with many. 

Once a blogger, always a blogger! The Seoul sweater in the middle, by the way, was something I acquired during an IAP program in South Korea my junior year.

I’ll end here with some of the biggest influences that have pushed me to think about what I really want vs. what I think I want and what the world seems to want from me: 

- Wanting by Luke Burgis

- Stolen Focus by Johann Hari

- Let My People Go Surfing by Yvon Chouinard (Patagonia founder) 

- Dries (documentary about fashion designer Dries van Noten that I’ve watched 3+ times — it’s the best reminder to focus on your craft, on your own terms)  

Happy 20th anniversary, MIT blogs! Blogging is back, everyone says, but you’ve been here all along 🙏

Thanks for having me.

"MIT, Medicine, and Success from Any School",Ahmed H. '12,11,2025-01-22T00:00:00-05:00,"In 2012 everything about life at MIT felt important: 
        Course 9,
      
 
        UROPs,
      
 
        WMBR,
      
 
        MIT-EMS,
      
 
        Model UN,
      
 
        blogging.
      
 It was all so monumental.

Thirteen years of hindsight have flattened the relief map of events in my memory. Only two incidents among countless all-nighters, events, and projects in four years in Cambridge (2008-2012) have any tangible bearing on my trajectory as I time travel at a rate of one second per second:

1. I met Sarah ’10, became friends, asked her out, proposed, got married, and the rest is history–we’ve been happily married, now with two dogs, for eleven years. The impact of meeting her is self-evident (that’s as romantic as this will get).

2. Vidya ’12 approached me after class to ask, “Did you see that LSU is taking out-of-state students?”

That one requires explanation.

We were deep in the medical school application cycle in the Fall of 2011. I applied to 27 schools but had only one interview. This was due to two factors: First, my middling GPA even in Course 9, after turning down the opportunity to “earn” inflated grades literally anywhere else. It felt like I was the only one of my cohort not making straight A’s, suggesting that it was possible (though perhaps not for me) to compete GPA-wise with applicants from 
        Harvard and other less-rigorous schools
      
 as an MIT pre-med. And second, my procrastination in submitting applications, which are reviewed on a rolling basis.

Despite being from New Orleans, I had not applied to LSU because they only accepted Louisiana residents–their strict definition of which I did not technically meet. LSU revised that policy mid-cycle and announced their intent to admit a handful of out-of-state students for the first time. Vidya, aware of my unprovable connection to the state and my struggles in the application season, shared the news that had somehow escaped my attention.

I applied that day, and received an interview invitation and ultimately my acceptance letter on Tuesday, February 21, 2012: Mardi Gras.

One medical school admission is exactly as good as 28. That offhand comment, which 
        Vidya
      
 says she doesn’t even remember, changed the course of my life.

Sarah and I moved, freshly affianced, to New Orleans. I took a brief detour to beautiful Maxwell AFB, Alabama to dedicate my career to the Air Force in exchange for tuition.

As for med school itself, I found it difficult even after surviving the Institute. There was a joke that maybe still exists at MIT: “Our tests are like, ‘The density of water is 1gm/cm3. Calculate the mass of the sun.'” Learning in medical school is the opposite of that. There is no room for independent thought. It’s all rote memorization. Every structure–nerve, artery, vein, bone, organ–and their embryologies, courses, features, functions, relations to surrounding structures, must be memorized. These answers cannot be intuited nor derived with a back-of-the-envelope calculation. In comparison, MIT’s “firehose” was an old man at a urinal.

But this too I survived. Along the way, I realized that Neurology isn’t for me because books are for nerds, and that I needed to work with my hands. My OBGYN rotation coincided with the realization that I loved surgery but hated General Surgery, and that OBGYNs also operate. It additionally coincided with my grandmother’s stage IV ovarian cancer diagnosis. Fate conspired to make me an 
        OBGYN
      
—the specialty I was least likely to pursue as a pre-med—and eventually a gynecologic oncologist.

I completed OBGYN residency at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth in Virginia, 2016-2020. Then I took unaccompanied orders to RAF Lakenheath near Cambridge (the English one) for two years, where despite the pandemic Sarah and I 
        traveled all over Europe
      
 and generally had the Best Time. I returned to NMCP for two additional years, all the while waiting for the Air Force to offer a GYN oncology training position. As a very specialized field, slots aren’t offered every year. My time finally came when I was selected to begin fellowship in July 2024.

Which leads us to the present day, where I am a gynecologic oncology 
        fellow
      
 in Washington DC. I love asking questions to move an entire field forward. My main research project involves advanced-stage ovarian cancer (for you, Mama), to devise a blood test to determine which patients should have chemotherapy first then surgery, vs surgery then chemo. Without getting into the weeds, this decision is a longstanding dilemma in devising treatment plans for patients with ovarian cancer.

And then there’s the clinical side, which is my true passion. Painstakingly removing every remnant of cancer in a patient’s abdomen. Answering an obstetrician’s bat signal when they find an unexpected 
        accreta,
      
 and despite entering the game already down 4 liters of blood, waving our wands and then three days later watching mom walk out of the hospital, baby in arms. Telling a patient that her post-chemo CT scan shows no evidence of disease. Telling a patient that her surveillance CT scan shows return of disease, but that new treatments provide hope. Telling a patient that her CT scan shows widespread worsening disease, and guiding her to a death with dignity, on her terms.

Revisiting the original musing: What was important about MIT? Moreover, what was exclusive to my experience at MIT, that still impacts my life today?

At risk of stumbling into a “friends we made along the way”-adjacent ending, if I went to another school there would be no Vidya looking over my shoulder. There would be no Sarah.

But many students get into medical school from University of Northeastern [Flyover State]-[Suburb] Campus or Harvard. Hell, they probably have an easier time of it with a higher GPA and 
        class rank.
      


If I had not attended MIT, would I have gotten into medical school? Would I have found love, and also two Weimaraners?

Maybe. Almost certainly, even.

14 years later,Yan Z. '12,12,2025-01-22T00:00:00-05:00,"Hi! Remember me? It’s only been 14 years since my last MIT Admissions blog!

Back then, I was a starry-eyed over-caffeinated food-obsessed Course 8 major with a penchant for iconic phrases like, “Could this brutalist hallway be any more translation-invariant??!”

A lot has happened since those halcyon days when virtually nobody had a smartphone unless they were participating in a Media Lab study. (Yes, we would dash from lecture halls to Athena clusters, 15” Dell Inspirons clutched tightly under-arm, to scintillate our understimulated brains by opening emails with subject lines like “free leftover iceberg lettuce in E52”; in fact, a single TikTok in 2025 delivers more dopamine than we would experience in an entire school year.) Besides a global pandemic, at least three decent memes, and the rise of LLMs like the one writing this blog post, the years 2011-2024 bore witness to my transformation from a directionless physics major into a jaded programmer.

What happened, you ask? Well, in my senior year at MIT, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do after college, so I took the path of least cranial activity and applied to physics graduate school. In case that didn’t work out, I also applied to what I thought to be two safe backup options: unpaid laborer on an organic farm in Hawaii and coordinator at an open science nonprofit. As it so happened, I was rejected from both of those jobs and accepted to all four Physics PhD programs as well as the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, a predicament eerily reminiscent of when I got rejected from The Cheesecake Factory but accepted to MIT in my junior year of high school (after which I dropped out). After weeks of first-world agony over which top-tier astrophysics PhD offer I should accept, I decided to go to Stanford.

Despite doing well academically, I had a depressing first trimester and took a leave of absence at the end of it. In January of 2013, I had no income, no permanent residence, and apparently no hireable skills in the startup-crazed city of San Francisco. No matter how many tech companies I sent a resume to, nobody wanted to interview me. Internally, I knew I’d find some way to prove myself to them; it just wasn’t going to be straightforward. 

Although my only real coding experience was a month-long IAP course where the first assignment was to implement RSA encryption in Scheme, I had already been indoctrinated into the free software movement by my MIT housemates. Plus I was paranoid about online privacy and using PGP to encrypt my emails, thanks to renowned whistleblower Chelsea Manning visiting the aforementioned house at MIT shortly before doing the aforementioned whistleblowing. With interests like these, I naturally gravitated toward the burgeoning 2010s cypherpunk movement, learning to program by contributing open source code to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Tor, teaching myself the basics of cybersecurity, and losing out on millions of dollars by understanding the cryptography behind Bitcoin but not buying it. Slowly but surely, I started convincing friends who were running shoestring-budget startups and nonprofits to pay me something resembling minimum wage for my time as a programmer and security auditor.

After almost a year of clawing through the SF technocracy, all while sharing a room with an MIT dropout who had run away to join the circus (neither of us could afford the full $900/month rent), I finally received two dream job offers on a cold November night. One was to be the first security engineer at a small company called Stripe, founded by some of my MIT friends during a summer in which I was incessantly annoyed with one of them for forgetting his kitchen duties (I had no idea what could be more important). The other was to join the Electronic Frontier Foundation as a Staff Technologist, under the wing of Peter Eckersley, a dear friend and mentor who sadly passed away in 2022. Everyone told me to join Stripe, but I picked EFF in the end.

The rest, as they say, is history. I won’t bore you now with my career minutiae, but some of my proudest achievements are helping secure over 500 million websites by launching Let’s Encrypt, finding a vulnerability that allowed me to remotely sniff browsing history, triumphantly sauntering back onto the Stanford campus to give a guest lecture in web security, and building a new web browser called Brave, of which I’m currently the Chief Information Security Officer.  

Morals of the story:

- Don’t be too afraid to pivot to a career unrelated to your major.

- Optimize for life-long learning.

- Buy Bitcoin in 2011.

 

Anyways, no blog post is complete without pictures, so here are 14 photos from 2024 to compensate for my 14-year hiatus. 


Starting off with a slice of my idyllic post-graduation life, here’s a sweater I knit for a bunny at my local rabbit shelter, who was chilly because he had to be shaved:



The Bay Area had a rainy winter, which meant wild mushrooms were plentiful by February. We took a foraging class and crawled through many, many wet brambles to unearth these:



Afterwards we cooked and ate the mushrooms that were unambiguously not going to kill us.


Later that month we took a short trip to Tahoe to traipse around in snow, which I’d experienced once or twice at MIT.



Azuki, my 9 year-old beloved pet bunny, had to go to the vet for a tooth trim.



After the pain meds kicked in, he was very floppy and needed help flipping over.



Fast-forward to August. We traveled to China and stopped by the Malaysian Durian Festival, which was (confusingly) in Hong Kong, because we are durian fanatics connoisseurs.



Apparently that wasn’t enough durian, because afterwards we went to Singapore and experienced a “Durian Omakase.”



By the time I got back to San Francisco, it was peak fig season!



Sadly, California’s bountiful autumn was cut short when I was forced to travel across the Atlantic for a work trip. Actually this was quite exciting as my company works remotely, and many of us have never met in person. I gave a few presentations and participated in a hackathon which was really fun.



When I got back to SF, it was both election season and Halloween season simultaneously. We celebrated by putting up a spooky spider collecting election mail.



I wanted to share the spider on something the kids these days call “Instagram,” so I went to the library to do some research. Good thing these books never go out of date!



Having lived in SF for over a decade, you’d think that by now I would have found all the scenic ocean views. Nope. Here’s one that completely escaped my notice until November 2024:



One of the perks of living in the Bay Area is an unending supply of jaw-dropping sunsets. Eventually you get used to it and stop noticing them, but you take the picture anyway to prove on social media that you went outside.

That rings a bell,Elijah T. '11,3,2025-01-21T00:00:00-05:00,"Nearly fourteen years after graduating, I still wear my Brass Rat every day. It feels strange when it’s not on my finger. I panic when I can’t find it. (That was a long lonely month when I thought I lost it for good, only for it to ultimately reappear under the couch.) I don’t know how long alumni typically wear it – I’ve spotted it on the fingers of a few others my age – but it has been present in all aspects of my life ever since leaving MIT. And it’s a constant reminder to me (and others) of my time there.

My Brass Rat

As a Course 1 (Civil Engineering) alum, I moved west to Palo Alto for my master’s and decided to stay when I realized I never want to have to shovel snow again. While I’ve seen others tempted by the fruits of Silicon Valley or otherwise find their passion elsewhere, I have stayed as a civil engineer throughout my career, working on a variety of projects – bridges, automated trains, ports, etc. During interviews, or sometimes just casually at work, my time at MIT still comes up (while I blush at them saying how impressive my academic background is). One can of course see that from my resume, but the ring has occasionally been a talking point as they recall colleagues or friends (or him/herself) having gone to the Institute.

After several study and work abroad opportunities at MIT, I thought those travel days were over once I began working. Somewhat to my surprise though, despite having a full-time job, I have continued to travel frequently, even working in South Korea for a year and, more recently, Singapore for over two years (until the pandemic happened and they reconsidered whether it was the best time to be building a new airport terminal). During one of those adventures, at a restaurant in Rome, a man spotted my ring from another table and struck up a conversation. He was an MIT graduate from the 1970s, and even decades later the ring was identifiable.

Cloud Forest, Singapore

Back at home in San Francisco, I went to pick up a robot vacuum for sale on Facebook Marketplace. As is often the case, there is that worry about me being scammed or walking into an axe murderer’s lair. But I felt a sense of trust when the seller saw my ring and related how she also was an MIT graduate. She passed two-factor authentication when she described her major by her number. (So I wasn’t too concerned when I discovered shortly afterward that the vacuum wouldn’t charge; she promptly sent me a refund without even taking the vacuum back. Not a scam!)

And these don’t even consider the many other times it has been a source of instant connection. I attend many board game and gaming meetups (think Blood on the Clocktower, not Dungeons and Dragons). At one such event, a fellow alum gasped in excitement when she saw me wearing the ring in the wild (and I gasped in despair at how old I was when she talked about how she endured the pandemic lockdown during her freshman year). At other times, it’s an impetus to talk about Mystery Hunt or some other aspect of MIT culture (or legend).

My partner has also asked me about it, wondering whether it’s common for Americans to wear college rings. No, I don’t think so. (Is that lore comparing the Brass Rat to the Super Bowl ring still out there?) But I long ago resolved to continue wearing the Brass Rat daily – at least until I get another ring…","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ring-400x287.jpg

"I may have been accepted to MIT, but",Snively '11,9,2025-01-21T00:00:00-05:00,"Hello – my name is Michael. You may know me as Snively. Or you may not know me at all because I wrote blogs back in the dark ages of 2008, nearly 20 years ago, when blogs were something *everybody* wrote in. I’m the author of such classics as

- That time we streamed a dance party from our floor lounge to the homepage of the admissions website and got shut down by the police live on stream.

- That time I accidentally deleted every piece of media I’d ever uploaded to the blogs.

- The big wheel rally race at Hasbro’s headquarters

- Overheard at MIT (these hold up remarkably well after 20 years), and

- That time the Navier-Stokes equation was derived during a lecture and my brain almost popped

It’s been four years since I’ve written a blog entry here, which seems ridiculous but that’s how it goes. Y’all don’t care about what’s going on in the life of a 30-something MIT grad, y’all want to know about campus culture, dining, UROPS, and all that nonsense. If you’ll indulge me, though, I thought I’d type some stuff. None of it will be as thoughtfully crafted as Chris Su’s, who demonstrated with every blog entry why he was destined to become a successful doctor and I was destined to become a twice-terminated project manager in Indiana :)

I want to get into a heartfelt section here about failure, I really do, but first I want to catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you last heard from me.

In June 2022 my second son was born, named Archer. He was a colicky mess with a funny-shaped head (which eventually sported a very stylish orthotic helmet) but he’s two-and-a-half now and adorable. Here’s him learning to use scissors for the first time at our local library a couple of weeks ago.

My firstborn is now 6 years old. You know all the people making fun of “Rizz” and “Ohio” and “Skibbidi?” My son is the person they’re making fun of. Man, he is ALL IN on Roblox, Skibbidi Toilet, Craftee, Cash and Nico, and all the other weird parts of the internet that make me feel old. Here he is at the same library on the same day, honing his Roblox skills.



Cast your mind back with me to 2016 and a blog entry I wrote about running my first ever marathon. It was Chris Peterson’s fault. Well, by 2023 I’d run four marathons and was looking for something harder. This was dumb. I decided I wanted to run an ultra marathon. This was dumb. I decided I wanted to skip those silly intermediate steps of 50k, 50mi, and 100k, skipping straight to a 100 mile ultra. This was dumb.

[sidenote – as I enter into this “long distance running” section of my entry, I can see media uploads here in WordPress from Chris Su, where he’s smiling, wearing medals, and running marathons at approximately the speed of light. Just more evidence of him making smart decisions and running respectable distances while I make dumb decisions. I’m sure his blog entry will be a delight. Mine will be pain]

So I found an ultra marathon scheduled for August 2023 and began training! I was at a marathon-level of fitness in January 2023, so I just had to get from 26.2 miles up to 100 miles in 8 months. How do you do that? RUN A F***ING LOT. No joke, I was running 6 days a week, 10-13 miles per day (except for weekends, which were trail runs and more like 16-20 miles). Full time job, two kids under 5, and running 13 miles every day. At the beginning (during winter) I could do my morning runs at the YMCA’s indoor track. They opened at 5AM and I was doing shorter distances so I could finish up and make it home, shower, and prep the kids for daycare without too much trouble. As the distances increased I started having to set out at 4AM each morning from my house. Dark days. Literally.

I did it though – I stuck to the training plan and ran all the miles and did all the prep and bought all the shoes (SO MANY SHOES) and even grew a hideous long scary beard so that I’d fit in with all the other ultra runners. And then it was time for the ultra. I’m leaving out a lot of stories but I could write dozens of blog entries about this experience, this is the short version. I set out at 4AM and jogged into the woods. About an hour later I realized a major mistake had been made. I did all my training in Indiana. Good ol’ flat Indiana. The ultra I was running was in eastern Ohio. Good ol’ not-so-flat eastern Ohio. The hills absolutely DEVASTATED me. Ruined me. I fell off the pace by the second aid station and had entered “just ignore the pain and keep going” mode by mile 26. At 11PM, mile 52, after burning 9,000 calories, and running for 19 hours, I collapsed in some rando stranger’s front yard and called in retrieval from my support crew (my parents). They couldn’t find me, so I had a nice half hour to reflect about choices.



Also, for those of you who use Garmin watches, there’s a stat called “Body Battery” – it’s basically a measure of how much energy you have at any given point during the day. If you get good rest and are charged up, you’ll start your day at 100 percent. When you’re just completely exhausted and feel like laying down and sleeping you’ll be at 5 percent (doesn’t dip below 5).  I love my body battery readings from this run.



I start in the mid 60s and bottom out at noon. Then I run 11 hours with zero energy in the tank. Because I’m dumb.

This was one of the first ever super big goals that I set out to conquer and failed at. I made it 50 miles, which was some solace, but ultimately I failed at my goal. 4 months later I’d encounter another failure – I was laid off from my job 3 weeks before Christmas. HAPPY HOLIDAYS! 2 layoffs in less than 4 years.

These three moments – two layoffs and a failed ultramarathon – were fairly transformative. I took a lot away from my first layoff. It was at a job that I saw myself staying at and growing in. It was in an industry that I understood and that I loved. I worked long hours, I established relationships, I volunteered for things, I got bonuses, I was valued, and then when sales dipped I was one of the first to go because I was too expensive. That’s when I realized that I’d endured a lot of stress and lost a lot of weekends and had absolutely nothing to show for it. So I decided to not do that again. And it’s been great. Work 8 to 5, leave work at work, and create clean divisions between professional and personal. Am I climbing the ladder, getting promotion after promotion, making huge money, etc? No. Is that ok? Absolutely. That first layoff was due to COVID so it wasn’t a complete shocker when it happened. The next one, though…

I felt reasonably secure where I was in 2023. I was the most senior project manager, knew our product well, my projects generally came in under budget and I mitigated the damage on the dumpster fires. But sales were down and they needed to roll some heads, so “bye bye most expensive project manager!” Fortunately, after what I learned from my last layoff, the actual experience of sitting in the conference room with HR and being handed a packet wasn’t as jarring as last time. As I walked to my car, sans phone and AMEX, I didn’t feel like I’d given more than I got and I knew the drill. I filed for unemployment, reached out to my network, started applying, and … failed. Good lord, applying to jobs SUCKS. If you’re not getting a referral or an “in” from somebody in your network, and you’re just applying to random job postings, you feel like your soul is being trampled. You just cast cover letter after cover letter into the void, never to be seen again. I had several promising leads that all came from people I knew, but I had ZERO responses from anything I cold-applied to. It was miserable. AND IT WAS CHRISTMAS TIME!

I’d exhausted all of my network connections and was interviewing for my very last opportunity and was fortunate enough that it worked out (thank god). By late January I was once again employed :) I’m sure many of you reading this are just going into college, so this advice is 4 years premature, but for the love of god, ESTABLISH A PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT NETWORK. Whether it’s LinkedIn or some other tool, you NEED a professional safety net, because finding a new job without one is disastrous.

So yeah, I may have gotten into MIT, but I’ve tasted failure for sure. And it’s been ok. To be sure, my failures are insignificant compared to some, and my life is still pretty good, but what’s helped a lot is always trying to find something productive to take away from the failures. Not necessarily a way to avoid them in the future, but an understanding of what led to it and how best to react. My first layoff helped me put the employer/employee relationship into focus and helped me better prioritize my life outside of work. My second layoff instilled in me the value of a network and making connections with all those you work with or near. And the ultra taught me that sometimes, no matter how hard you work, you’re just going to fail, and it’s ok to not succeed at everything you try. And that running ultras sucks.

Tens of thousands of MIT applicants are about to face one of the biggest failures of their lives in 2 short months. If you’re reading this, and you’re applying, you’ll likely not be admitted. Sorry to be a jerk about it, but don’t think for a second that you’re guaranteed to get in or stand a better chance than anybody else. There are going to be over 20,000 applicants for a freshman class of fewer than 1,500. Don’t let this failure ruin you. Be upset, take time to process, but make sure you take something away from it. Find the lesson, whatever it may be for you, and use that to make your journey through life easier when you encounter more failure.

And, you may not want to hear this now, but know that there are LOTS of paths in life that don’t involve MIT. Lots of really really good paths. Do you know how many alumni I’ve been employed with since graduating? 0. Do you know how many amazing and successful people I’ve worked with since graduating? A lot. A lot a lot. They went to schools like Purdue, Embry Riddle, Rose Hulman, Oregon State, Georgia Tech, Indiana University, and so on and so forth. And they’re doing great! And you will too.

=======

Ok, that’s the end of the heavy part. I think for the rest of this I’ll just post things that come to mind about my last few years of life.

- I’ve fallen into the black hole that is Formula 1 and am so excited to finally have a sport that I actually enjoy following! I’ve spent my entire life watching other people bond over sports and talking about players from years past and different pieces of drama and I’ve just never cared about any sport – until F1. I love it.

- My son, in Kindergarten, already has his first girlfriend. They hold hands when walking home from school every day and it’s heart-melting.

- I’ve started putting Rubik’s Cubes into square jars and selling them on Etsy. If you want a Rubik’s Cube in a jar, from yours truly, go forth and purchase (shameless plugs are the best).

- I got to watch an eclipse from the bricks at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which was pretty cool.

- Chuck E Cheese is no longer a sketchy drug den with moldy carpet, and is actually pretty darn cool now. You should check it out.

- I made my son a little Lowe’s cart and he’s adorable.

- I sold all of my childhood Pokemon cards for $1,400 of store credit at a local game/comic store. Now I’m enjoying hunting for Digletts and Charmanders with my son using my infinite supply of store credit. Let me know if y’all have Digletts and Charmanders you want to donate to the cause, we’re trying to complete master sets of each.

- I got fat, then less fat, then even more fat, and now I’m working my way down towards less fat again.

- I built a deck

- I bought a talking toy rocket and I am in love with it

- I bought a Bambu P1P and am also in love with it

- The LEGO Rivendell set is amazing

- Going to Disney World with a 4 year old is WAY different than going with a 1 year old.

- Favorite Computer Game is a three-way tie between Shapez2, Trimps, and Balatro.

- I still cross stitch and design cross stitch patterns. I’m building up a library of original Formula 1 patterns that I’ll do something with eventually.

Ok, I think that’s it. I mean, that’s not all of it, but that’s as much as I feel like writing right now.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-20-at-3.23.43%E2%80%AFPM-e1737404780560.png

what i talk about when i talk about running,Chris S. '11,10,2025-01-21T00:00:00-05:00,"“At the core of many of his stories was a distinction between success and excellence. Success was ‘having:’ money, awards, status. Excellence was ‘being:’ living your values, having them guide your daily life. Pursue excellence, Coach would say, and success will follow.” – Deena Castor, Let Your Mind Run

Last year, I ran just over 1200 miles. I have never hit that kind of mileage before. In Chinese, we say “people beyond people, horizons beyond horizons” (人外有人，天外有天) – this kind of mileage is still trump change among those who really run.

As the years go by, I see a lot of life reflected with each mile that goes by. I am not a bestselling novelist, but Murakami wrote an entire book about life and running, so I might be on to something? 


HIGH SCHOOL

I started running during my freshman year. Honestly, I was not a great, or even a good, runner. I signed up for running mainly because I was not coordinated enough for team sports. Even though I am six feet tall, I always found basketball confusing (it is still, to this day). How are you supposed to know where to be on the court? How do you set up plays? Volleyball was better, but arbitrarily it was a women’s sport in our school, while the men did soccer.

So, I joined the track team.

My distances were 800 and 1500 meters. Later, I realized that this is where the coach put all of the people who weren’t naturally talented and weren’t “serious enough.” Putting folks like me in the middle distances freed up the shorter distances for the gifted sprinters, and us “amateur hobbyists” were less likely to get seriously discouraged or injured compared to training for the longer mile+ races. However, as anyone who did varsity track knows, the middle distances are HARD. 800 meters is sprinting 2 laps, the first lap at 80%, the second starting at 95% and ending at 110%. While I was quite mediocre – I never cracked a 6:30 mile in high school – I did enjoy the meets. My goal in all of HS track was to scrape by and qualify for the away meets, with traveling being the best part.

What track did teach me was discipline and mental visualization. When the racing got tough, I broke the track down into 100 meter segments. I soon learned from running hundreds of laps around our high school track that the first 100 meter curve has a slight incline, but then it’s quick dash down the straightaway for the next 100, followed by the second curve which usually involves running against some headwind. The last 100 was pure adrenaline, flying down the straightaway in front of the bleachers. 800 is 2 of these sets, 1500 is (almost) 4, rinse and repeat. When I was on the track and the pain is setting in, I always told myself, “If I could do this 100, I can do another 100.” Much later I learned that the famous running coach Jeff Galloway talks about the importance of having personal “mantra” in pushing yourself through the tough parts of a race – this is exactly it. Also, Winston Churchill paraphrased it well, “if you’re going through hell, keep going.”

“running running as fast as we can, do you think we will make it” – running, no doubt

I used to circle the track with this song on repeat in my brain. In high school, the future was uncertain. I went to high school in Taiwan. Which college was I going to land at in the US? I had a girlfriend then. We would probably break up, because that’s what happens, right?

(yes.)

MIT AND MED SCHOOL

I did not run much at MIT or in medical school in NYC (see the “I am not a great runner part”). I ran about once a month. However, the Charles River is so beautiful for running. Even Murakami talks about this in his book. I had a terrible sleeping schedule at MIT (I still do – unfortunately I am also now the father to 2 young children). I usually went to bed at sunrise, and got up sometime around lunchtime (looking back at it, how I got through undergrad missing the vast majority of my morning classes is remarkable). I loved doing a ~5 mile loop from New House, up the Charles River until I could see the Harvard brick buildings, cross the bridge, and then run back on the Boston side. It frustrated me to no end that I always crossed over the Charles on “Anderson Memorial Bridge.” I never understood why that couldn’t be called Harvard Bridge instead (since it led to Harvard Square!), and Harvard Bridge renamed MIT bridge. Heck, even Boston University has a janky bridge. Justice for MIT – equal bridge naming rights for all!

The MIT to Harvard loop, very flat, very scenic.

Anyway, I used to time my run so that I would see the sun rise behind the Prudential Center on my way back on the Boston University Bridge. Sunrises over the Charles are so pretty (especially in the winter, but I saw the most sunrises in the summer when the sun rose earlier). The beautiful purplish-orange sunrises remain some of my fondest memory snapshots from college. My dorm (iHouse in New House) had a little terrace that overlooked the river, and I would often go out there right before I headed off to bed around 5-6 AM. Yes, I ran this loop mostly around 3-4 AM after wrapping up studying for the night. I used to tell people that I lived on Hawaii time at MIT, because my 5 AM bedtime was a very reasonable 11 PM or midnight bedtime…in Hawaii.

Then, I moved to NYC for med school. My dorm was on Madison Avenue just north of 96th in “East Harlem” ONE BLOCK from Central Park. Looking back, I severely underappreciated my proximity to this world-famous park. I usually entered the park on the East Meadow entrance, immediately north of the 97th St. traverse, link over to East Drive, and then proceed to run the 6 mile Central Park loop. Sticking to my bad habits, I often ran this at 10 PM. The doormen always looked at me curiously when I headed out in leggings and a running jacket, “Everyone is just coming back from studying, and you’re going running?” My roommate (a native New Yorker) informed me, more pragmatically, “You’re gonna get shot one day.” (Recognizing my male privilege), I am quite impressed at the number of runners in Central Park after midnight. I am never the only one, and I usually pass about a dozen or so on my loops around Manhattan.

The Central Park loop, highly recommended if you’re visiting NYC and have time to run!

“if you had one shot, or one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment. would you capture it, or just let it slip?” – eminem, lose yourself

This song summarized medical school. In the hypercompetitive environment of gunning for grades and a good residency, everything felt like the “one shot” or the “one opportunity.” It became my new mantra. With more years behind me, however, I now consider opportunity to be less important than the preparation to seize the moment. In Chinese, we say, “the stars align, the conditions are favorable, but most of all, the person is ready.” (天時地利人合) There’s another great quote, “the more I practice, the luckier I get.” You get the gist.

RESIDENCY AND FELLOWSHIP

January 7, 2017 (NYRR Joe Kleinerman 10K) was the day when my “modern era” of running began. Residency was still in NYC with a few life updates. My then-girlfriend/now-wife Kathy ’10, moved from San Francisco to New York in 2015 to start her residency with mine, capping off 4 years of cross-country long distance dating after MIT. I moved out of my dorm to a 650-square foot 1-bedroom apartment, 8 blocks south, 3 blocks east.

After a year of living with me, Kathy noticed that I never exercised.

“You should get out more. How is it possible that you never need to exercise?”

“Meh.”

A few months pass.

“I’ve looked up these races in 2017. If we finish 9 of these races in one year, we get to run the NYC Marathon next year!“

“Okay.”

I joke to Kathy now that this is one of those watershed moments of your life where you look back on, and say, “Well, if I just never said anything that day…”

The beginning of it all!

That 10K was my first race in a very long time. Between high school and January 7, 2017, I half-sprinted, half-walked the NYC Half Marathon 2013 with Helen ’12 who came down to visit me from Harvard Medical School with absolutely no preparation (2:13). I said half-sprinted, half-walked, because I went out way too fast and spectacularly imploded after mile 10, walking the rest. It is quite remarkable that through my foolhardy approach I ended up injuring my left knee, with residual pain for months afterwards. To this day, my left knee is still wonky compared to my right.

Helen ’12 and I at the 2013 NYC Half! She’s now a full-fledged critical care / ICU physician :)

In 2017, I rediscovered the forgotten “runners high” that was the reinvigorating reward after the hard interval/tempo days of high school track. I quickly became addicted. I ran all of the longer races with Kathy, but couldn’t help letting loose at some of the shorter races. It was fun, and my times started dropping quickly. I ran my first marathon in New York, on 2018, just like Kathy and I had promised each other we would do. However, I did it solo because Kathy became pregnant before the marathon (and our first daughter was born a month after the marathon). We ran the 2019 NYC marathon together, dropping off our baby with one of our friends. Notably, I had a major cramp at Mile 24 and Kathy could have beat me by probably 20 minutes, but to her credit, she opted to stay behind and finish together.

We had the great foresight fortune to move out of NYC before the COVID era, and we landed in Ann Arbor in August 2019. Before Michigan, I never lived in a freestanding house. I spent my entire life in dorm rooms and apartments. I never saw any stars in the concrete jungle of NYC, but there were plenty of them in Michigan. Similarly, my running routes took on a distinctive rustic tone. 10 minutes after exiting our house and crossing the highway overpass, I would be running next to cows grazing in the field on the local farm road. Winter running was challenging, but I discovered I could tolerate down to about 15 degrees, when running became too extreme as I stopped feeling my face after 45 minutes. I tried to keep up the momentum, although 2020 was a challenging year for everyone. My favorite race in Michigan was the Capital City River Run out in Lansing. The course follows this beautiful woodland trail in Michigan’s capital city (I have a thing for capital cities). I ran it annually from 2019 to 2021, and I was very pleased with my 2021 time of 1:51 which was my half marathon PR for some time.

This 12-mile loop I used to do while training for marathons. The best thing about Michigan is that people are so courteous to you when you’re running on the shoulder!

“come on Eileen, oh i swear, at this moment, you mean everything” – come on eileen, dexys midnight runners

My favorite running memory happened at my third marathon at Chicago in 2021. Chicago is known for its fast course and it culminates with two straight miles on Michigan Avenue coming into Grant Park. Out of nowhere about a mile to the finish, I hear the strains of a fiddle, and a full-blown Irish folk band comes into view, striking up “Come on Eileen.” I will never forget the rush the build-up to the chorus gave me as I surged into Grant Park (almost getting a spectacular cramp right before the end).

“THE REAL LIFE”

We moved from Michigan to Seattle in mid-2022. We love it here. Yes, it rains a lot, but it does not rain nonstop in the winter (the locals say that to scare you away). We live on a hill fairly close to Puget Sound, so on my daily runs I can often spot the container ships heading out of Seattle into the Pacific. Seattle is very hilly, unlike every other city I’ve lived in. It makes for great running practice, but makes me hate life sometimes. I no longer run at night, but opt for the late afternoon (I still cannot get up early).

In 2023, I amped up from the 500-odd miles I’ve been running annually, incorporated some speedwork, and ended the year with about 750 miles. Addicted to the progress I’m making, I increased my annual mileage above 1000 in 2024. I also trained for my marathon last year by actually following a plan to the letter for my first time (unsurprisingly, it makes a big difference).

Now, I race 3 half marathons and 1 full marathon annually. The goal is to beat my annual time targets (for 2025, it’s 1:36 for a half and 3:45 for a full) by the end of the calendar year. By the way, I have no interest in ultras. With kids, I’m always finding ways of being faster so I can get home faster, so why would I want to run longer? 🤪

Yes, I’m holding a condiment bottle. Interestingly, I found they make for very nice reusable cups in the now popular “cupless” races.

My ultimate goal is to qualify for the Boston Marathon, however long that takes (duh, what else did you expect I would end with?). That will be my ultimate homecoming. I don’t think I can do it with the qualification times before 40, but maybe in 10 more years after I hit 45? 😉

“Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you’re going to while away the years, it’s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I believe running helps you do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that’s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life—and for me, for writing as well. I believe many runners would agree.” – Haruki Murakami

Other ways I’ve been rejected over the past fifteen years,Cristen C. '10,3,2025-01-21T00:00:00-05:00,"After my rejection from MIT in my prior post, I attended Cornell for my next degree and had a sensational time. Now, many years later, we revisit rejection with a renewed lens.

Professional writers and performers—and all others forced to bid periodically for their next opportunity—eat rejection for breakfast, I’m sure. For many, rejection can be debilitating. Some turn to exposure therapy, or perhaps the simulated version, maybe even a literal game to conquer, in a pressing effort to desensitize themselves from the pain.

The mere passage of time turned out to be that desensitizing force, for me.



Ultimately I remember only a few subsequent rejections from the past decade and a half.

- After graduation I returned to Cambridge, where those hiring for entry-level positions were happy to reject me, many times over. It turns out local graduates in my field are favored over candidates from outside the region. It made for a nervous 1-2 years.

- A pal gruffly rejected my hug; it later comes to pass they do not like being touched.

- Distinct from the typical drift between lapsed friends, one favourite gave me the slow fade. Fatalistically, I am told by others that’s just how life works.

- The first—so far only—big conference talk I submitted was unceremoniously declined.

- After we moved in 2021, Andrew J. ’10 and I placed offers on a number of houses, all losing to competing bids.

- I hit up a grad school acquaintance in my new city who never responded.

- Several essays I wrote in application to a particular early-career leadership program in my field went into the void, I guess.

- I filled out an application to be a volunteer member of an advisory group in my city, and never heard back.

- After reaching a later interview stage and fumbling the coding exercise, I got rightly rejected from a position at a startup. My interviewer—the founder—was perfectly nice about it. Job rejection can be simply a matter of having the wrong strengths at the wrong time for the company.

That there are fewer bullet points above than years elapsed feels like some sort of win, though I concede the meager pool of opportunities sought (can’t take the risk aversion out of me, alas).

But I couldn’t help but to notice that, in the rolling average of emotions, successive bets feel much lower stakes. Decisions made at the cusp of my childhood felt vitally important to my future well-being—which they were, in actuality—thereby giving rejection an unpleasant life-and-death quality. Whereas now? Coming from a place of stability and abundance gives me the upper hand here, helping me keep rejection in perspective.

I guess I’ll be okay.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/itsbeen84years.gif,1
[Guest Post] A Whiff of Nostalgia Amidst the Scent of Youth,Ceri R. '16,3,2025-01-20T00:00:00-05:00,"For the integrity of alumposting, I’m pasting Daniel’s bio from 2009 (when he last blogged for MIT Admissions) as a brief intro: Daniel is the Director of Student Financial Aid and Student Employment at MIT.

For the integrity of alumposting, I’m pasting Daniel’s bio from 2009 (when he last blogged for MIT Admissions) as a brief intro:

Daniel is the Director of Student Financial Aid and Student Employment at MIT. He has over 15 years of experience in the financial aid and student financing industry, including stints on “all three sides of the fence” — working for loan originators, loan servicers, and financial aid offices. 

A proud father of two daughters, Daniel also has a budding career as:

There is never a quiet moment in his life, and he likes it that way!

If I ever write my autobiography, I’m going to start it with this line: “I was born in a place that doesn’t exist anymore.” No, that doesn’t mean my homeland fell into the ocean, or was destroyed by the consequence of a natural disaster, but rather that the place of my birth has become an accident of human history. See, I was born in the Panama Canal Zone, at the time an American enclave filled with transplants from overseas living in and managing the transatlantic shipping crossing. My parents lived in the Canal Zone for 28 years and I was born about halfway during their stay which meant that when my dad retired, we moved to South Carolina (where they were from originally) and I left my community of friends behind.

I plan on going back to Panama this year. We are planning a trip to see the physical sites I grew up visiting daily – my elementary and middle school, the places we went for vacation (El Valle de Anton, Chiriqui Province), and the home where I used to live – but the people I knew are gone. The friends I made in school, the bowling league, the cub scouts, the swim team, the community theater people – they have all dispersed. While I can see the remnants of a life once lived, and I hold treasured memories, I can’t revisit or reconnect with the people themselves.

So why revisit? Why go back 40 years later? Why take the time to memorialize what came before? The answer, I think, is that it was an important part of my life, a time of growth and identity formation, and even though I can only see the skeletal remains, there is an honoring of what’s come before and the way in which they have shaped the person I have become.

In 2004, during my tenure as Director of Financial Aid at MIT, I learned about a project which was being undertaken by my colleagues in Admissions. Ben Jones and Matt McGann were introducing a revolutionary change to the Admissions website, and were going to feature staff and student bloggers. The idea was that there would be fresh content regularly rather than the static sites many schools used. I approached them and asked if I could be a part of this effort as a financial aid guy; I wanted to share information about how our process worked, sure, but also as importantly, I wanted to give applicants and the public an opportunity to get a view of the people who worked at MIT, to give you a chance to get to know us. From the beginning of the project until my time came to move on from MIT in 2009, I was part of the blogging crew.

You can’t find my older posts online now. Much of the content was relevant to the timeframe it was published and it really doesn’t make sense to have it public now (although if you are stealthy, you can search for it at the Wayback Machine or read my blogging mission statement at MIT Admissions | Blog Entry: “Feeling lost”). So, sure, much of what I wrote is not visible anymore; it doesn’t exist (see what I did there?). But the legacy lives on. The work that Ben, Matt, Anthony (’09), Bryan (’07), Jessie (’07), Jess (’10), Paul (’11), Mitra (’07), Sam (’07) and so many others contributed (and our current bloggers continue to contribute) represents the ongoing commitment to transparency and relevance that set the site apart from the very beginning. What an honor to have been a part of the initial crew, and what a great opportunity to revisit on our 20th anniversary.

So, what’s the legacy? How has the experience shaped me? I can say that for me personally the opportunity to reflect and share personal experiences in this format made me a better financial aid professional, and gave me a unique opportunity to interact with students and parents in a way I haven’t seen anywhere else. I miss it… And while I have tried to keep other blogs (looking at you Moneyman’s College Financial Aid Blog and Talking to Myself | Poetry from Now and Then) the impetus to stay updated with them just hasn’t been the same. I miss the community and the camaraderie of the MIT Blogs, and I do admire and envy the folks who still have the chance to share a glimpse of their lives and their process with you.

Maybe the popular adage really is true – “You can never go home again”. But here’s hoping you can at least visit on momentous occasions.",,0
I’m more than twice as old as when I started my blog,Anthony R. '09,15,2025-01-20T00:00:00-05:00,"In 2004, I applied to MIT.  It was a paper form, the first part, and I filled it out by hand and mailed it with a stamp.

I remember this because I scrutinized my handwriting, ripped it up a few times and started over, trying my best to be legible.  I was 17, and I thought this sort of thing mattered.  It was the first year of the MIT Blogs, after all, and I felt a connection with the team who would review my application.  I wanted them to like me!

In 2014, with my MIT degrees and my own blogging career behind me, I wrote a reflection post after being out in the real world for four whole years.  It’s still on point, and you should go read it.  I was 27 then and the Blogs just turned 10.

Well, now I’m 37, and the Blogs are 20.  I’ll put this into perspective: the Blogs are older than I was when I applied; and, now I’m older than the admissions staff I tried to impress!

Damn.

+++++

In hindsight, I couldn’t have guessed in 2004 that life would be this rich, or this hard.  After MIT, I lucked out with a 15-year run (and counting) in my chosen field, peeking behind the curtain of things I’d long been curious about, and somehow getting paid nicely for it.  I also met my wife thanks to MIT, when we both lived in DC and randomly attended the same alumni event.  We joke that we would not have ended up together as students, even though we overlapped and had friends and classes in common.  Time changes people, and priorities.

Indeed, I’ve found that timing is everything.  Being in the right place, at the right time, when someone specifically needs you.  There is no other magic formula to engineer most of life’s important outcomes.  Sure, you can increase your likelihood of success by being smart, or hard-working, or a good storyteller, or even just being young and not “set in your ways” – but luck plays a huge part.  I think this is true about everything from college admissions, to getting a great job opportunity, to meeting your soulmate.

I learned a few other things:

- As you prepare to leave for college, almost all the days in your life that you’ll spend with your parents will be behind you.  You’ll grow up, and one day before you know it – maybe suddenly in your 20s or 30s, like me – they’ll be gone.  Nobody else will know your history, your successes, nor celebrate you or be as proud of you the same way, ever again.  You won’t know how this feels until it happens to you.  So while you shouldn’t tolerate bad behavior, at least try to be a little patient with them now, and even indulge them.  Take trips with them, build new “adult” memories, maybe have some adult conversations.  One day, you’ll have to decide what to do with all their adult stuff, PLUS the kid stuff you left behind.

- Live below your means.  Spend less than you earn, pay off debt as quickly as possible – and as your income grows, resist the urge to inflate your lifestyle to match it.  It doesn’t matter what your friends or co-workers are buying, so try not to compare.  Start by saving a few months of expenses for emergencies, then open a Roth IRA, pick a boring, low-cost, broad market index fund (not meme stocks) – and just let time do its thing.  Because of compounding, you should start while you’re still a student if you can.  Continue being mindful about spending when you start working full-time, and you’ll have even more to save and invest – hopefully wisely and in a diversified manner.  Financial confidence is wonderful, often far more in your control than you realize, can be achieved even with modest earnings, and puts you in the driver’s seat in many areas of life including the ability to take larger career risks, sabbaticals, prioritize family, or even retire early.

- On a related note, who you partner up with (or especially marry) is one of the most financially important choices you’ll ever make.  Fights about money are a leading cause of breakups/divorces – which cost even more money!  So, find someone who is on the same page as you regarding saving and spending.  Screen for this during your first few dates.

- After college, it becomes a lot harder to make friends.  As you go from job to job, you’ll find that workplace friends are situationally relevant (like complaining about the same boss) but often aren’t durable after you leave that common ground.  If you can keep one or two close to you each time you move on, you’re doing great.

- When you get to the age where friends are having children, and if you decide not to have children, don’t be surprised if your paths will cross less frequently.  I don’t think this is either side’s intention at the outset, but it just happens, especially if you no longer live in the same city.  Social media makes it easy to stay in touch, but there will be less in common about your daily life experiences.

- Celebrate resilience when you see it, but also, have compassion when you don’t.  Everyone has something going on inside of them that you don’t know about.  It could be a current struggle, or an insecurity, or a past event that they haven’t completely worked through yet.  For example, the Covid pandemic majorly impacted a lot of people, and those impacts endure – but for some reason the world wants to move on and forget it happened.

- Finally, at MIT we tend to pride ourselves on the quality of our intellect, knowledge, and work product: it’s a meritocracy.  Surprise, most of the world isn’t.  The old adage that “MIT grads end up working for Harvard grads” has some truth.  Perception is reality, and if you can tuck in your shirt, look polished, and tell people what they want to hear, you’ll often be rewarded (at least in the short term) even if you haven’t got a clue what you’re talking about.  So, look out for slick talkers with résumés full of short stints and few substantial contributions.  They might be adding value somehow, but you won’t relate to them.",,0
It’s been a long road…,Jessie L. '07,3,2025-01-20T00:00:00-05:00,"Why yes, I am rewatching Star Trek: Enterprise!

My hair has been updated in the last seventeen and a half years.

Hello, blog readers! This is Jessie (they/them or she/her), class of 2007 and one of the earliest MIT Admissions bloggers. I lived on 5th East in East Campus and I majored in course 9 (Brain & Cognitive Sciences). I started blogging in the summer of 2005.

First of all, I’m running the Boston Marathon in April! I’m raising money for the National Organization for Rare Disorders. I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome myself, which is something I didn’t know in college (you can actually read a little about how I learned at that link). My Linktree has a few links to my different donation incentives. It’s the first time I’ve run the Boston Marathon (or any marathon), but I’ve run the BAA Distance Medley (a 5K, a 10K, and a half-marathon, put on by the same organization that puts on the Marathon) for the past two years.

Me running the 2024 Boston Half-Marathon in November.

For various reasons, I don’t want to specify exactly where I work, but I’ll say that it involves tech safety in the context of a human rights-related field, doing mostly national-level and some international work. I’ve gotten to advise government departments (both US ones and foreign delegations visiting through a Department of State program), tech companies, and the UN, all of which is pretty neat.

I ended up getting a PhD in computer science after a few post-MIT years of working in tech. I did a postdoc at Harvard, in computational public health. Then I decided that I didn’t really want to keep pursuing academia after all. I went into another field altogether, one that saw heightened need during the COVID-19 pandemic, while also learning and practicing digital security in my personal time. That combination of disparate fields led to my current job. It has nothing to do with my undergrad major, but it has everything to do with my attraction – which I had then – to interdisciplinary work.

This was my grad school profile pic from mid-2013. I was 28.

Outside of work, I’ve been busy, and not just with running. I make metal/glass/gemstone jewelry as a hobby, and I do a lot of activism. I learned a decent amount of Haitian Creole and have volunteered with newly-arrived migrant families. I’ve been a street medic – a first aid volunteer – at protests since 2011, and was on the scene providing first aid in 2017 when a neo-Nazi ran a car through a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. There was a famous photo of me in the news. I don’t want to post it directly here because it requires big content notes for terrorism and blood/injury, but you can find it at the top of a WDTV (CONTENT NOTE) article from August 12, 2017. My activism has taken me a lot of places: from Ferguson, Missouri, to Washington DC, to Tijuana, to the Southern Arizona deserts, to Palestine. I’m active in my local Democratic Socialists of America chapter, and in 2021 I did a community organizing fellowship with progressive Jewish organization JOIN for Justice.

I made this solid bronze amulet by hand! Also the silver and moonstone pendant in the pic at the top of this post.

I never talked much about Jewishness as a blogger, because I was in a period of my life where I assumed that “normal” Jews wouldn’t accept me. Children of intermarriage have become more and more accepted in Jewish communities, but we weren’t always. In the 17 and a half years since I graduated from college, this is something that has become an integral part of my life. I’m a member of the Boston Workers’ Circle, a left-leaning Jewish cultural center. Somewhat recently, I started volunteering with the food pantry at Jewish Family & Children’s Service (my favorite role is helping the “shopper” volunteers meet complicated combinations of medical and religious restrictions as they fill food bags for the clients). Anyone can receive food from this food pantry, but it’s the only one with kosher options that I know of locally, and my impression is that it’s unusually good at meeting medical food restrictions. A large number of clients are elders, including some Holocaust survivors. I’ve been learning Russian to be a more valuable volunteer, because a lot of people served by JF&CS are Russian speakers.

I’m a very different person than I was from 2005-2007. I’ve been married since 2010 and just became a homeowner. I’m older, wiser, and have been through a whole lot more (seriously, I’ve seen and been through some things). I know more about myself now (it would have been helpful, in college, to have known that I was autistic with ADHD, or that I had Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or that I was pretty seriously depressed). The concepts of genderqueerness/nonbinariness were only starting to be on the radar of people I knew. But there’s a pretty clear throughline between what I was then and what I am now.

I used to think that an MIT education doesn’t simply open doors – it teaches you how to find creative ways the other side. I thought that as a struggling 20-year-old. I still basically think it now. My intellectual interests are very, very different (and honestly, much deeper) than they were then. My work has nothing to do with my major. But I still think that MIT played a pretty big role in forming me into what I would be as an adult. Forged and formed, like I do with metal when I’m in the studio.

A high school graduation party in 2003, a few months before I started at MIT. It’s been a long road.

P.S. Nobody has cared about my undergrad grades in a very, very, very long time. I promise you that you can have some rocky times academically and still go on to professional and personal success.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/signal-2024-12-05-134404_002-400x533.jpeg

So let me first say that: the blogs actually turned twenty on August 6th, 2024. But as you get older, time has a way of sneaking up and past you, the way that, for many people, one’s birthday shifts from being a moment of annual celebration to a puzzling punctuation in the calendar. Hmm! I say to the mirror, looking at nearly forty-year-old man in the mirror, where a bright-eyed twenty-three year old MIT Admissions officer used to be; how did that happen?

So today, the twentieth of the first calendar month of this, our twentieth year, I wanted to let you know that we’ve asked some of our crufty distinguished alum bloggers to come back and share some of their memories with us. Over the next week or so, if you see posts from them, do not be alarmed! Treat them kindly, help them cross the street, and hang out in their comments. They are here to visit from the past, to tell you about what it was like when your present was their future, as is the fate of all of us.

what i ate in a month*,Janet G. '27,2,2025-01-19T00:00:00-05:00,"MIT is not exactly known for our dining. Well, even if it was, I’m sure that it’s known (derogatory) rather than known (complimentary); unfortunately for now, I’m not here to say any 
        saving graces. 
      
 If you want an honest review of MIT dining hall food, sponsored by my lovely 
        compulsory meal plan friends,
      
 you’ll have to wait.

I ate a LOT of 
        good food over Winter break. 
      
 I’m happy to say that both my 
        Beli 
      
 and my wallet were satisfied; however, given that eating out never satisfies your wallet that much, I’ve decided to monetize my hours spent gushing on all my Beli reviews. I also fully admit that the last time I did something like this 
        I trolled pretty hard
      
 with a post that was neither a full week nor about food that much, so I’m here for my compensation arc. Here’s all the good (and bad) food I’ve eaten over the past 
        like three weeks, 
      
 along with a true week of my authentic (and half-assed) cooking over IAP. I’m pretty sure ~3 + 1 = 4 weeks = basically a month, so here goes!

Week 1: New York and Toronto

I did not have many nice things to say about New York, and yes it was my fault but I’m still going to hate on the food I had there. I’m just going to link my Beli reviews. 

tan tan ramen @ ippudo 5th avenue

kinda tourist trappy? the price was reasonable and service was quick, but for my tantan the pork was cubed rather than like authentic mince which made me sad. the ramen was flavourful if not on the saltier side, and the chicken karaage was a little dry but overall fine. it was just like fine food and i was tired after trolling by taking the wrong train so 🤷♀️

pizza!

vegetarian and kosher. the base was thin and crunchy, and i really liked the eggplant trio and vodka sauce one; it was also nice that it was vegetarian. i shouldn’t have gotten the buffalo tofu one, it was way too oily and the tofu was a sorry excuse for an attempt at chicken. i was already full by the time i got to the buffalo chicken too, so there wasn’t a big point?? pretty pricey for the pizzas too, so i probably wouldn’t go again— if i did i would just get the pizzas who are confident in their vegetarian identity

beef noodle soup… @ silky kitchen (fwiw i saw on other people’s photos that there were better looking dishes)

maybe i’m just not a fan of these thick rice vermicelli but the flavour was just not there. the beef was a cheap cut which threw me off, the bokchoy was undercooked. the broth tasted like ready made chicken broth boosted with msg and it’s like ?? 

a good bowl of beef noodle soup is hard to come by. i fear that you’ve just gotta invest in a good bowl or go to china because 💀 this was sad. maybe i should stick to stirfrys which are harder to do badly

badly taken photo because i was trying to run to a broadway show. if you’ve seen this photo before no you haven’t

so i also got this chicken kebab and hotdog (and my friend Nicole got a philly cheesesteak) for lunch one day. not sure what my brain was thinking but i was clearly making the wrong decisions because why did i choose a food truck right next to times square ☠️ anyway paid the idiot tax which was uh… *checks wallet* $54 for 3 items. not the most wise financial decision i’ve made in my life and it sure does keep me up at night sometimes. if not for the price the food was pretty good and i also didn’t actually get food poisoning which is a huge plus 

rainbow lox bagel from liberty bagels

god saw my suffering and gave me a christmas miracle — a meal that i enjoyed during my disastrous new york trip?? crazy!! anyway this was pretty good even if the wait was like 30 mins. huge fan of the lox filling. the bursts of saltiness from the capers are just so balanced out by the creaminess of the scallion cream cheese, and then the unique taste of smoked salmon pads it all out to be this rich undertone of smoky goodness… anyway huge fan. the bagel itself was pretty cold for some reason though, i’m sad they didn’t toast it up more. my fault for getting the rainbow bagel instead of the everything bagel. new york you’re redeemable i will be back 

I landed in Toronto on the 27th, and started off with a meal that captured the quintessential suburbia brunch experience. 

SO YUMMY the angus beef burger was juicy and the bbq chicken was so flavourful. considering that they’re sandwiches it can’t be that complex but i thought that all the ingredients were good and pretty fresh. chicken was slightly on the drier side but still reasonably tender, and the portion was SO GOOD (or maybe i’ve just been traumatised by boston/NY prices and spoiled by exchange rates) for the price.

HOTPOT at souper hotpot in toronto! again if you’ve seen this photo before no you haven’t

Hands down, best meal experience I’ve had in a long time. The company was great, the service was impeccable, and the broth was SO flavourful without being overpowering. Also, for the price? Boston could never. 

my actual review (can you imagine that this was also abridged): 

incredible place. there’s almost always a line but it’s worth the wait; the servers and cashiers are SO NICE and the food is so cheap and pretty high quality too!! would come back to toronto literally just so i can come back to this place 💞

they do it by weight but you can ask to weigh your pot in between getting more ingredients so you can keep the price reasonable. 

the soup bone broth was sooo good i highly recommend getting that one and then customising your own spice level with their free toppings like chilli oil and stuff. they also did free refill for my friend because his soup ran out!! 

the servers were so attentive – they gave us aprons and hairties and gloves and sanitizer wipes and refilled our water and gave us extra bowls all SO quickly. they were watching all the tables like a HAWK

oh my god the free ice cream at the end was also SO GOOD man it was peak vanilla ice cream. after a spicy oily meal? peak experience. 

[removed my notes on what ingredients would be good to have in the broth… this is subjected to personal taste and also otherwise i’d actually be exposed for how long i raved about this place for. this is hands down my favorite restaurant so far thanks Patti for the rec <3]

a friend’s comment on my beli review, for reference; thanks helen <3

Oh and because I didn’t have enough ice cream that day, we walked over to get a second round of ice cream. Worth it though.

ice cream! from Good Behaviour

server was very charismatic and fun. let us try a lot of ice cream flavours and was super easy going. lovedddd all the flavours we got but here’s my personal ranking lol

-  matcha cookies and cream (new concept!! matcha was done well. clean and so yummy)

-  butter pecan bourbon (so rich, felt kinda unique too? nice bourbon notes too hehe)

-  strawberry shortcake (very tangy but strong cheesecake authenticity)

-  s’mores (very gooey; super true to the flavour (hella marshmallows and everything) but i’m not a big fan of hersheys chocolate sauce)

-  viet coffee (very coffee forward. useful for waking up, but mostly just like solidified coffee. authentic tho)


Good day for my stomach and social life; less good for my wallet… 

the reviews are as follows: 

tacos: shrimp and steak tacos were quite good. i liked the steak over the shrimp one but i would get both again. corn was a highlight and charred well; i think overall enjoyable experience, portions were a little small but honestly filling enough, and also smth smth weak CAD makes for this to be pretty cheap anyway. ambience was really nice

desserts @ bloom cafe: so cuteeee i also loved the food. would not get the pudding again but it was worth a try, it was very light and sweet and well done but i just don’t like earl grey and peach that much. maybe same with matcha yuzu. i would try the sundae again and maybe get one of their mochi bc they looked so good — this place feels like food is generally higher quality so worth trying out a variety

matcha latte: matcha latte did not disappoint! excellent ambiance. would go again and try different lattes. good place to yap, the pink mood lighting was sooo cosy. apparently stripe press is hosted here?? also a bonus

rice @ twilight cafe: technically a board game cafe but the food is good and we just yapped. very good portions and it’s just like good classic hongkong style gamer cafe food LOL pretty authentic. the gyudon was a little too fatty but it was fine. we also got chicken and cabbage dumplings to share which was definitely too much but still pretty standard. lighting was a bit too bright and jarring though and didn’t feel cosy, but whatever we had a really good time overall

Week 2: Toronto

bengali sweets!

i tried these really delicious bengali desserts courtesy of 
        Dron’s parents!
      
 They’re all condensed milk based and involve rice and syrup. I’m not actually the biggest fan of millk but the flavors here were well balanced and not too sweet, and I loved the soft/cakey texture of the sweets. 

this was a good new year’s eve dinner at a fancier place: behold probably the second longest review I wrote right after the hotpot review.

entree bread

- very soft, a little oily but it’s yummy bread. very spongey and cakey. olive oil wasn’t necessary but was fun 

baked brie

- came on reasonably quickly 

- sooo soft and creamy! the phyllo wrapping was crunchy and made the brie feel reminiscent of salmon. very flavourful 

- the bread was very crunchy. not enjoyable by itself

- i also tried the brie with entree bread and it was fine but i saw the value of the crunchy bread 

- good bite: tomato sauce then cheese then the bread. smalll piece

carne pizza

- banana peppers were a nice touch. crust was crunchy and thin, maybe could’ve been more chewy

- cheese pull was good

- housemade sausage was a highlight and the salami you couldn’t really tell was there

- still i think it’s pretty stock standard good pizza. pizza has a low ceiling imo in terms of flavour so this is about as good as it gets 

12 hour braised short rib

- the meat was very tender; fell apart with a very slight tease of the knife. with the sweet carrot it’s very rich

- you can taste the faintest notes of red wine tbh i would’ve liked it to be stronger 

- cabbage is unnecessary and maybe slightly undercooked. not a fan 

- white bean ragout was ok? idk tbh i feel like it plays along with the dense and heavy flavour of the beef, which is okay but i would’ve preferred something like asparagus or something maybe lighter to complement the short rib. the marinara sauce style thing was just v italian lol

- short rib is a relatively cheap cut but they braised it very well such that the fatty bits were enjoyable and not too gamey

Here’s an arbitrary double divider for the new year! I celebrated the new year with a bunch of friends, and we braved through the rain (and a couple who refused to let everyone else see the view for half the fireworks show) to watch the Toronto fireworks at the harborfront. Honestly, I do prefer the Boston fireworks I watched last year, but I think the friends do make it all worth it. Shoutout to the friends who spent new years with me <3 

After the fireworks, four of us split off to hunt for burgers and poutine because why not. Great meal to start off the year with: indulgent and extremely unhealthy, but fun. 

We also dragged ourselves up in the morning again to visit the Niagara falls. I am a huge fan of Big Water Falling Down, but unfortunately was not a fan of the Wendy’s burger that I tried. Behold, my most popular Beli review:  

wendy’s square burger

where was the sauce. meat was dense and underseasoned

That was it. I think I understand hater culture now… pensive

I hung out with one of my dear friends Aileen the next day! Props to her for all the excellent photography.

We also went to visit two friends after and ate some good fruit and cheese (not pictured!) we made some very cute clay keychains though. Thank you to Flora and Ben for hosting us :)

our little clay works… not edible but pretty cute

At some point I got too sick of writing food reviews so I gave up. I explored Toronto a little by myself today and had a DELICIOUS bowl of beef noodles. noodles were THICK and HANDMADE, beef was TENDER, the soup was FLAVORFUL. silky kitchen is sulking in the kitchen right now. also a great matcha latte from a different location of the same shop that Aileen took me to yesterday but the mug and the cold from yesterday made that one better I think

I’m pretty sure this was the day where Dron’s parents COOKED. There was just a lot of good food that I didn’t have time to take photos of; if the family was a restaurant i think i would’ve probably ranked this first place. huge fan. I also haven’t really had Bengali cuisine before, and the flavour profile and base was so fresh! None of it was too spicy for me (thankfully), and I’m a huge fan of the aromatic base (onion, garlic and tumeric, if I recall correctly). The roast that lasted a few hours infused so much flavor into the mutton, and watching the meat fall apart at the fork was great. It was also really nice to have the cooking explained starting from a cultural basis; I learned more about Dron’s parents’ Bengali upbringings too, which really gives the food experience an unparalleled layer of depth. Parents (especially immigrants who have travelled between different cultural contexts) can seriously have the most interesting stories.

I also stayed over at Miranda’s (a fellow ‘27! <3) and she made this delicious crepe cake which basically rivalled Lady M’s (AND there was no added sugar, so +100 for helth). Miranda’s parents also made the best Chinese food I’ve had since leaving home so that was very heartwarming (and stomach warming… the FLAVORS i cannot explain it all in words) 

Week 3: Toronto & San Francisco

very very good congee

woke up to some of the best congee i’ve ever had. i think this congee had a chicken soup base because it was so rich, and it had the right amount of tanginess from fermented vegetables and ginger. there was also seaweed i think which gave it SUCH a good sense of umami. great dish but incredible given that it was breakfast for a chilly monday morning 

soft tofu stew!

I actually didn’t like this tofu stew that much. I fear my palate was spoiled by the other good food I ate, but this tofu stew just didn’t have as much depth of flavour as I would’ve liked. Always a huge fan of barley tea though, and the side dishes definitely helped the light broth up a little.

hot chocolate and matcha latte

This hot chocolate was good. I learned my lesson and stopped having caffeinated matcha lattes (no matter how good they are) in the afternoon ☠️also a huge fan of the ambience of this cafe, although maybe it was a little too cozy…

This is one of Miranda’s fav cafes! 
        The menu looked suspiciously well designed to me, 
      
 but the food was actually so good. I had this ochazuke which was very fun (you had to pour hot tea on it to cook the dish, by which I mean Miranda poured it because I was not sure how to pour it without burning myself). The flavours of this were much more well balanced. It was savoury and had the lightest hints of tea even though we poured the whole jug over it; there was also a sweetness that I couldn’t quite pinpoint. The rice also had a texture like congee rather than being soggy, which is great. For dessert we shared a mango sago; it was fruity and fresh, not much else to say.

After saying bye to Miranda and Laura (who came to visit) over some delicious bao buns, I went to visit the Royal Ontario Museum with Crystal! She had just landed from Panama, but I was very glad to have caught her. We had these mid parmesan fries and sweet pie, and I’ve decided that I enjoy custard and jam, and want something less sharp and more melty when it comes to cheese on fries.  

Dron joined us for dinner (sometimes it’s a very small world!) and we had an interesting experience at this Thai place — our conclusion at the end was that “the max rating of dishes across all three of us would be very good, and the min rating of the dishes across all three of us would be very bad.” 

my subjective personal rating (the other two differed based on personal preference): 

tom yum soup

- very spicy. chill is were unfortunate 

- flavourful and sour and sweet notes came through

- shrimp was good 

khao soi

- crispy noodles a huge plus; i like the oily like taste 

- curry taste not too spicy and a relief after the soup. rich with the turmeric taste. creamy 

- noodles were chewy and tender 

- beef on the tougher side but still flavorful

rice mix

- very hot 

- shrimp is too sweet

- anchovy is nice texture and salty burst 

- chicken is soft and flavorful 

krad pa krao

- beans first hit. very savoury and i love these types of beans so this was great 

- good mix; egg + chicken + rice was good bite 

- i really like the rice it’s not sticky or undercooked and balances out the savory spicy kick 

For my tragically final day in Toronto, I masqueraded as a 
         UofT 
      
 student and tried out the dining halls! It was actually a really good experience. Huge fan of the dining hall and how pretty it looked, and the food was way cheaper than MIT’s, and also quite good (even if you had to pay for individual dishes and dessert seperately lol). The salad bar is pay by weight so that’s unfortunate, but I don’t think 
        it’s priced too badly?
      
 The food is also made in smaller portions compared to MIT, which I think makes for better seasoning control. The ingredient freshness is marginally better. Anyway, shoutout Toronto for keeping it real with all the good food and great company, and I will most definitely be back. 

When I landed in San Francisco, Devansh and 
        Claire 
      
 kindly picked me up and told me that we had to make a stop at In-N-Out. The burger was great; I didn’t actually like their fries (why are they so papery?) but overall a very good time, especially with some of the best yappers I know <3

A group of our friends also hosted a cooking competition, except unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) we were only allowed to cook vegan dishes along with some other metrics. My team and I cooked a smashed cucumber salad (a favorite!), potato eggplant, and a peppers mushroom tofu stirfry. I like to think that the flavors were reasonably balanced, and the cucumber salad was especially fresh and bright, but we did marinate the eggplants in salt for a bit too long, and the stirfry did get a little cold. It’s fine, because 
        the true prize were the friends we made along the way 
      
 and also enjoyed some cakes (celebrated a few friends’ birthdays that day too)!

the dishes we made are in the foreground

The sourdough was nicely toasted here; I didn’t like how the texture of the baked egg white almost congealed, and how the dish looked like it was swimming in oil. The flavours of the sausage and tomato base were good and I’m always a fan of a jammy yolk, so this was like a mid spinoff version (?) of a Shakshuka (don’t quote me on that one). Wouldn’t have again, but I don’t regret it. 

brunch with yang @ marlowe’s

I also made dinner with Helen W. ‘24 this day because I was crashing with her :’) we also bought some very yummy Trader Joes snacks. The snacks were to excuse our lateness to one of her friends’ board game nights, which was a very very wholesome house of board game nerds! We watched a scary game of Fish (which maybe wasn’t that scary, but I have an awful memory and so am terrified whenever Fish is played), and then played a game of Terraforming Mars. Helen and I almost won which is pretty cool considering that I was basically half-asleep the whole time (oops); I did actually enjoy the game a lot though, considering how it tickled my little monkey brain with all the shiny cubes and fun little gathering and counting up points that we were doing. 

dinner :)

Had a typical more mid suburbia brunch on my last day in SF. None of this felt standout, it was all a little bland, and I didn’t really like the decision to deconstruct the burger (reconstructing it is MESSY. you’re supposed to give ME the satisfaction of taking it apart). However, the ingredients were reasonably fresh, we had some good chats over the food, and I didn’t pay for it so really I’m not complaining!

salmon burger and potato salad… hmm

Week 4: Back in Boston

This week is hopefully somewhat more realistic for a week of my food habits in IAP, which also happens to be an exposure of how lazy I am when it comes to cooking! 

once i landed, i’m pretty sure i just made instant noodles + kimchi once i landed. girl was a little exhausted from a painfully long flight what can i say

on the first proper day i was back, i woke up to go to trader joes and INDULGE. grocery stores are a guilty pleasure where i go in with no list and just let my inspiration take me. they had a full aisle of eggs (SF could never)!! can you imagine?? anyway i had a very joyous lunch where i tried the chicken soup dumplings which were pretty yummy, along with a grilled kimcheese (i know i’m an innovator with that name) and a jelly. 

for dinner i made some instant noodles with MORE kimchi (yes i’m obsessed whatever) and fried up an egg and some trader joes pork dumplings. very good 

this took like 15 minutes yay

the next day, i went to trader joes for the second time in two days (obsessed what can i say) and fried up some scallion pancakes, dumpling and eggs for lunch and garnished with kimchi and mayo. oh and i forgot that i bought kimbap which was very yummy. i also noticed that i felt a little off (spoiler alert…) so i had an orange and randomly bought a probiotic pineapple juice shot 

for dinner i fried up some fish that had been in my freezer 
        FOREVER,
      
 stirfried some onion and egg, and also some potato and eggplant. had it with rice with friends Espen S. ’27 and Roshni P-M ’27. it was very good even if it took me two hours; peeling potatoes and reducing the water from the eggplant down is SO time intensive. 

this was so good we didn’t even bother really plating it (i was hungry after standing for 2 hours straight)

so something in the world didn’t want me going to trader joes a third time because i woke up today and felt SO off. i had some honey ginger tea and fried up some dumplings + egg + leftover eggplant & potato, and also had an orange; this unfortunately couldn’t save me as i proceeded to nap and wake up with an awful fever and massive headache. 

i didn’t eat anything else that day because i was so exhausted but i drank a LOT of water (like three brita filters’ worth throughout the whole night). it was awful but seriously sleep and drink lots of fluid if you’re sick; i may have been absolutely knocked out, but since i had slept for like 20 hours intermittently and drank so much water, the next day my fever had already broken. locking in for recovery definitely helps. 

so the fun life update was that…

~✨ i caught the flu ✨~

i still felt fatigued today and certified that in fact yes i had caught The Flu, but i pulled together a lazy-ish meal because i knew i had to eat. you basically dice up an onion, and then throw it in some oil with a box of ground beef, box of tofu, and half a bag of peas (or whatever the pan will fit — i would’ve put more peas if i could). this is relatively quick to throw together (20 mins??) and tastes quite good. i had mine with rice for lunch and some of the last remaining potato eggplant stirfry for dinner (i made a lot what can i say). i also ate grapes that day because i feel like i have been underrating the value of fruit in my life. 

today was surprisingly not slay all things considered; i couldn’t bring myself to do anything, so i proceeded to make my favourite comfort food (which is unfortunately a little higher effort): congee! i hate following recipes so i literally just filled up a pot with water, grabbed some scoops of rice (i couldn’t find a cup and i was too tired to ask around), threw the rice in when the water came to a boil, and then just sat around until the rice got mashed pretty easily by my spoon. i forget to track the time very often, so i really prefer heuristics-based cooking. i then literally just threw in some seaweed, corn, eggs that i beat up, and sesame oil and soy sauce and voila i have yummy congee. this may have been my only meal for the day but it was a good meal what can i say 

that brings us to today (the 19th)! i’m currently still kinda tired but i’m basically fully recovered, which is pretty cool. i just ate a bowl of my leftover congee mixed with my 
        beef stirfry from two days ago, 
      
which is pretty good. this blog is gonna get out 
        before dinner 
      
so you’ll never know what i have next i suppose

anyway, not quite sure what the moral of the story here is. i originally intended for this to just be a fun post where i flex all the yummy food i got to eat on rare occasion, but i guess i had to get karma’ed and expose myself for my more sus food consumption habits (especially when i’m sick and lazy and 
         also don’t want to order food because it’s overpriced). 
      


hmmm maybe the moral is to GET YOUR FLU SHOTS KIDS IT’S FLU SEASON AND IT’S NEVER TOO LATE TO PROTECT YOURSELF!! i fully admit that one reason i probably did get this sick was because i forgot to get the flu shot last year when MIT Health hosted free flu shots, and then proceeded to procrastinate and forget to get it again. i regret this a lot. i hope you don’t regret it the same way i did 👍 in freshman year i may have gotten quite sick a few times, but i did get the flu shot that year and then i think i at least got sick one less time during IAP than i counterfactually would have. please please please get all your vaccinations and things in order for both yourself and others; you’ll never know when it might come in handy to have a flu vaccination ☠️

also! i think a really important moral is that having kind friends is really cool because it means that even if you’re an international and going home is painful and arduous, you can still sometimes travel around and visit friends and have a really good time that way :) shoutout to everyone who kindly hosted me for so long!! especially Dron, Miranda and Crystal <3 huge fan of the canadians in my life who live up to the kindness stereotype 

oh and final moral of the story is probably to not sign yourself up for a monster of a 5.3k word blog while you’re still sick and procrastinate so that you finish it at the last minute. oops

like a bear who has stocked up on food stores from the plentiful fall, i too shall go hibernate in my cave for the winter. see y’all later","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image46-400x533.png

Jill Biden waved at me,Aiden H. '28,0,2025-01-19T00:00:00-05:00,"This 
        IAP
      
 I only took one class and it already finished, so I decided with the extra time that I would go visit my girlfriend in Washington D.C. It wasn’t until a couple days before leaving that I noticed that I would be in town for 
        the second most important event
      
 of the weekend: inauguration. Here’s a cluster of weird and very surreal moments that have happened while I’ve been here.

***

Cut to the greatest dining experience of my life. We were walking around Georgetown shops and randomly decided to eat at a fancy restaurant (Brasserie Liberte, if you’re curious) because it sounded good despite our notable lack of fancy clothing and vibe. As soon as we walk into the entrance, two ominously tall workers in suits charged at us, holding us by the door and asking if they can search us. Confused, I said yes as one of the workers took my Barnes and Noble bag and searched through, asking, disappointedly, “Just books?” As much as I wanted to impulsively blurt something sarcastic like “Sorry I left the bombs at home :(“, I was too intimidated by the almost-definite weapons they had on them. I initially assumed this was all heightened security due to the election, but when shown to our table I noticed a line of security blocking off the backroom, and we officially decided someone important was in the restaurant. We did eat at a relatively weird time, but the restaurant was still very scarce, with us being one of four tables in the entire place, including the mystery guest. Considering it is D.C. and inauguration season, we weren’t entirely shocked that someone could be in the restaurant, but we couldn’t figure out who it could be. I threw out names of senators and political figures as I kept peeking my head back to see who it was. At one point I thought it was Liz Cheney because I saw a bright pink suit.

Besides everything crazy that was happening throughout this experience, this food was genuinely crazy and totally worth it despite the minor manhandling at the door. They even gave us free French fries to apologize for “poor service”, which I think they did because all the workers were obviously on edge and constantly trying to act cool while sneaking glances towards the back of the restaurant.

When our salad was brought out, a line of security started walking past us. An older lady at the table next to us stood up and started aggressively clapping, repeating the words “Thank You”. All of the other people in the restaurant looked up and noticed that it was not some congressperson, but quite literally the First Lady just casually walking right beside my table? As in less than a foot from me? She waved and smiled at everyone on the way out, and naturally it has been the only thing we’ve been talking about for days.

So I guess this is your sign to go to fancy restaurants for fun with friends, and maybe something cool will happen?

***

The next day I visited Old Town Alexandria, which is slightly Boston-core in the way that it is all very brick and has a lot of historical features, albeit these were more educational as they were focused on Virginia’s role in the slave trade and not the superfluous patriotism of dumping tea in water, but I guess I digress. Old Town was a lot busier than normal because of the inauguration tourism, which I completely forgot about until I saw this:



Personally? A little deflating. In general? The funniest thing I’ve ever stumbled upon. Looks like Jill was waving goodbye in more ways than one.

***

Cut to a very different dining experience. Tonight we went to a Lebanese restaurant in downtown/Penn Court. We took the metro from GW to Metro Center and were immediately reminded that tonight was the night before inauguration. In the three block walk to the restaurant, we had to walk through barricades in streets, have police officers usher us across sidewalks and around rallies, and turn down stands selling Trump merchandise.

The meal was perfect because the restaurant was peak ambiance and Lebanese/Mediterranean food is my favorite, but the entire experience felt like an event in and of itself, when we were just trying to eat? The police cars barricading off streets had their lights on, with every window becoming emblazed. with red and blue. Out of the window by our table I could see both pro and anti-Trump protestors surrounded by barricades and security, covered in light. This was all outside of the MLK Memorial Library with a man on a Jumbotron-esque screen asking if I had spread the word of Jesus recently. Everyone around us at the restaurant was discussing their plans now that the inauguration had been moved inside, and it took me a noticeable and important effort to check myself in public, to recognize that the color of a sweatshirt should not cause me to hate people sitting next other than me in a random restaurant. Something I hate in democracy is when one side loses, they suddenly don’t support democracy? This, as we probably all know, has happened on a large scale in recent years, but I think everyone is guilty of this and it peeves me to no end. Why was I allowing myself to get upset that people were exercising democracy by celebrating an open election? Shouldn’t I be glad that thousands of people want to partake in the free process of swearing in our next democratic leader? Am I nothing more than a hypocrite who would be in the masses I was watching with disgust from the restaurant? This is a common thought process I like to walk myself through, but in light of the most recent election not matching my personal political views, it has become something I find important, especially when I was surrounded by the very thick of it during my time here in D.C.

In the visual onslaught of Trump paraphernalia I was exposed to, I decided to test my own limits on the way back with some photos of my own. Despite the photos and the shirt being (hopefully) obviously ironic and satirical, even if a little true, I was still heckled and yelled by visiting tourists for wearing a shirt they disagree with even though I very much did not yell at theirs. It doesn’t matter though, because I find these very rodent-core photos of me not trying to freeze a hilarious way to enter the events of tomorrow.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-1173149023-800x1067.jpg

Guess who can legally drive alone in Maine now?,Andi Q. '25,1,2025-01-19T00:00:00-05:00,"Last Thanksgiving break, a few of my friends and I visited Acadia National Park in Maine. We planned meticulously for the trip – booking the Airbnb months in advance, creating an itinerary of trails to hike, and even planning each meal down to the ingredient – until one big question remained: Who would do the grueling five-hour drive from Boston to Maine?

Everyone was understandably reluctant to drive, so I volunteered. After all, I’ve had my South African driver’s license for three years and was no stranger to driving long distances back home. Immediately, however, my friends objected.

“Don’t people drive on the left side of the street in South Africa?”

“Andi, this is Boston traffic we’re talking about. Aren’t you the least bit terrified?”

“Is it even legal for you to drive here?”

My friends were right about the first two things, but I assured them I’d practice before the trip and drive extra carefully (and slowly) while we were still in Boston. To their third objection, I smugly pointed out that Massachusetts (like most US states) allows driving with a foreign license printed in English.

“Yeah, but what about the states that don’t?”

To my dismay, a Google search revealed that Maine only allows driving with a foreign license only if I’ve been in the country for less than a month. But I wasn’t about to let anything get in the way of my Acadia trip.

“What if… I just got a US driver’s license?”

“Right now?”

“Right now.”

For the last three years, I’d always put off getting a US license for several reasons, such as:

- I was too busy with classes to spend a day at the 
        RMV
      
 dealing with the paperwork.

- Massachusetts requires you to use a friend’s car and have the friend sit in the back seat during your road test.

- Driving in Boston is terrifying.

But this year, I finally ran out of excuses, and this Thanksgiving trip was the catalyst I needed to get started on the process. My fall semester classes perfectly aligned such that I had a permanent 5-day weekend, and I realized I could pay a driving school to use their car for the road test. A US license (with REAL ID) also comes with many perks, like being able to travel between states without having to carry my passport and risk losing it. I was going to live in New York City after graduation too; as terrifying as driving in Boston is, I felt that doing my road test in Manhattan would be much worse.

With that, I hatched up my ingenious three-step plan:

- Go to the RMV

- ???

- Profit

Foolproof if you ask me.

The Learner’s Permit

Unfortunately, nothing involving the RMV is ever that simple. Despite having three years of driving experience, I still needed to get a learner’s permit before doing my road test.

No worries though – I knew how to drive and what all the street signs meant (even though they’re different from the rest of the world for some reason), and after reading through the Massachusetts Driver’s Manual, I could ace all the online mock tests I took. Plus, I was allowed to get a generous seven of the 25 questions wrong and still pass.

With the confidence of a Bostonian driver running a red light, I marched into the exam room, expecting to breeze through the test. However, I quickly learned that the online mock tests I used had left out a rather big portion of the actual test: laws about the Junior Operator Licence (the license you get if you’re under 18). I only briefly skimmed the JOL part of the driver’s manual because none of those laws apply to me anymore so I assumed the test would have at most two questions about it, but my test had at least five. And of course, I got all of those questions wrong.

In the end, I barely scraped by with just enough correct answers to pass. But a pass is a pass! The Thanksgiving trip was only a week away at this point, so it was too late for me to do the road test and get the proper license. Still, I could finally drive to Maine (as long as someone with a valid license accompanied me)!

The Road Test

Despite having a shiny new learner’s permit in hand, I didn’t end up driving to Maine. One of my friends, an EMT who drives the MIT ambulance, joined the trip and volunteered to drive instead. (Probably for the better, because she’s very good at driving – much better than me.) I still got in some good driving practice in Boston and parallel parking practice in Maine, so I scheduled my road test after returning from the trip.

As you can probably tell by the timing of this post though, I did not blow away the examiner with my impeccable driving skills. In fact, the test went so poorly that I didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. It was kind of embarrassing, especially given that the South African road test is objectively way harder (e.g., we have to do it in a manual transmission car) and I was able to pass that test as a teenager.

The Driving Lessons

Anyway, I took that first road test as a sign that I needed much more practice, so I signed up for a few driving lessons before retaking the road test. Honestly, I really needed those lessons. If driving in Johannesburg is middle school, then driving in Boston is MIT. The roads here are so much more chaotic, and there are so many more hazards that I never had to deal with back home.

Firstly, there’s the weather. The temperature almost always stays above freezing in Johannesburg, and winters there are dry, so the roads are never icy there. In contrast, Boston was covered in black ice this morning because it rained last night.

Next, there are pedestrians. Johannesburg is a very car-centric city with a surprising lack of sidewalks, so there are few pedestrians and even fewer jaywalkers. In contrast, pedestrians and jaywalkers are everywhere in Boston. One time, someone walking her dog even saw me slowly rolling down the street and decided to run onto the street in front of me.

Finally, there’s Boston’s awful road system. People complain a lot about Boston drivers being dangerous, but after driving around Boston for a week, I can say it’s less a driver skill issue than an issue of the roads being near impossible to navigate. Not only are many of them missing road markings (so it’s hard to tell where you’re meant to go), but their layouts and designs are confusing and often misleading. Several times, the lane I was in seemed to end abruptly and become parking lanes with no warning, and there’s even this one street in Chinatown with a one-way sign pointing in the wrong direction. I got yelled at during my road test this morning for straddling lanes, even though the markings indicated only a single lane. And don’t even get me started on how narrow the lanes are. Awful. Truly just awful.

My driving instructor and prior driving experience made these lessons go rather smoothly, but still, there were more near misses than I’m proud to admit. I’m amazed that bus drivers can drive around Boston all day without causing massive car crashes.

The Road Test… again

After all that I’d gone through in the past week, retaking the road test felt very anticlimactic. I’d scheduled my test for a Sunday in the winter at 7 AM, so there were almost no pedestrians or other traffic on the roads. I just had to drive around the block, do some maneuvers, and return to the parking lot; all was said and done within 10 minutes. “Eh, good enough” was the only feedback the examiner gave me after the test.

Despite the lack of fanfare, my brain was on a dopamine high the whole time as I biked back to MIT. As anticlimactic as it was, passing this mundane little test that most people pass on their first try as teenagers felt like one of my biggest achievements at MIT. Because finally, I can legally drive alone in Maine now!",,0

 In addition, Qatar Airways offers a “stopover program,” for multi-day layovers with free/heavily discounted hotel bookings in Doha.

Here’s a recount of my adventure! Hopefully, this will be the start to a fruitful series of Fiona Travel Blogs.

Day 0 – 1/2

I arrived at Hamad International Airport with Jade, 
 and made it through customs, where I got the first stamp on my brand new passport! Afterwards, we checked into our hotel and dropped off our luggage. We decided that our first destination would be Souq Waqif, a Qatari marketplace. On the outskirts, it felt similar to a fancy/quirky mall, but there was a part on the inside that looked historic, as if it had been preserved for many years, with only the exterior changing with time. I got a fridge magnet to add to my ever growing collection, and we saw arrays of spices, golden camel charms, and fake designer bags.

We ate dinner at “The Village,” a restaurant that served both Middle Eastern and Indian cuisine, then went back to the hotel to 
        collapse in our beds
      
.

While we were waiting to be checked in, I watched the TV in the lobby. A woman reached into the desert to pick up a rock formation, the sand falling in streams over her palms, revealing the rock formation she had found: a collection of round intersecting spines, all the same beige-yellow as the desert sand. The spines intersected in a way that resembled the rock’s namesake: the desert rose.

Day 1 – 1/3

Our only full day in Doha! We started off the day by eating lunch at Saasna, a restaurant that had been recommended in a travel guide in our hotel.

Afterwards, we walked to the Museum of Islamic Art Park, then caught a taxi in time to watch the sunset at Pearl Island, a small artificial island north of the main city. Along the way, we passed by a beautiful mosque and saw dhows, a type of traditional Qatari boat. Pearl Island was beautiful at sunset, filled with multi-colored Western-style apartments and hotels. Come nighttime, we got to see the Corniche, a street lined with Doha’s most interestingly-shaped skyscrapers, lit up with every color of the rainbow.

Then, we took a taxi to Katara Cultural Village and had 
        dinner
      
 at “Tasty Street”.

At night, we booked a tour where we went “dune bashing”: basically, we went in a jeep/offroad type car whose wheels were deflated to drive on the sand. The sand was so bumpy! I got some slight motion sickness, but the excitement of the whole thing kept me from becoming very very sick. We also had a short camel ride. Although I was almost falling asleep at that point, I seemed to gain a new sense of vigor when I saw the camp full of camels, all with saddles on their humps. The ride was very wiggly, and right after getting on the camel was the hardest part, since the camels would always lift their hind legs first, making me feel like I was going to fall sharply forward. There was a guide who led both the camels by ropes, and the whole ride was only 5-10 minutes, with us only walking a little ways outside the camp. But overall, Jade and I were pretty excited the whole time. “I can’t believe we’re riding on camels right now!” we said through our exchanged glances (and through words).

camels !! (right before we rode them)

The tour concluded with seeing the Inland Sea, a lake in the middle of the desert, that looked absolutely beautiful under the stars. I wondered how surprised the first person to discover the Inland Sea must have been. A sea, appearing without explanation, in the middle of a vast desert–how surprising was that?

We then drove to the ocean and the tour guide pointed out some lights on the other side of the water. “That’s Saudi Arabia,” he said, to my awe and amazement.

Day 2 – 1/4

Last day in Qatar! We ate lunch at the Museum of Islamic Art Cafe, which presented a stunning view of The Corniche during the day. Then, we checked out the museum, which was filled with different types of art from around the world, all sorted into a bunch of galleries by region. Fun fact, the exterior of the museum was actually designed by I.M. Pei ’40!

Afterwards, Jade and I got desert roses from the gift shop. Desert roses, or gypsum roses, were a source of fascination to me ever since I first saw the video in the hotel. I wanted nothing more than to hold one in my own hand, a phenomenon that I thought too carefully calculated to have been produced by nature. I noticed that every single desert rose in the gift shop was unique, 
 and I picked one to my liking to join me on the next leg of my adventure.

[Guest Post] Getting Help @ MIT,Jeremy W.,0,2025-01-17T00:00:00-05:00,"A thank you to all the supportive faculty & staff at the ’Tute

In my first month at MIT, I:

- Caught COVID, then a cold, then strep

- Had my parked car crashed into

- Moved from Hawaii (and had movers break half my stuff)

- Ran out of prescription meds (because my health insurance changed)

- Tripped so badly walking down Amherst Alley (on a completely flat surface) that my big toenail ripped off

- Injured my left knee (badly enough that I needed physical therapy)

- Had my cat get sick

- Had someone steal the pedals off my bicycle

- Had ten other appointments with the VA

- Had a few other problems I’d rather not share here

- Struggled with classes (see above)

I was late for class that day 🙁

After 12 years in the service, I got out of the Navy in August and started at MIT in September. I knew that this transition would be challenging. Juggling all of this and what I’ll call “normal adult things”—making a budget and paying bills, doing chores, taking care of myself, etc.—was a little overwhelming.

So when I felt like I was drowning, I asked for help. Asking for help can be a little scary. I think it’s especially hard at MIT because it means being vulnerable and admitting that you’re failing a little… and folks here aren’t used to failing. The biggest highlight of my first month here was experiencing how much MIT prioritizes supporting students.

Something I wish someone would have told me from the start is: you can’t even imagine the kind of support you’ll get. You don’t need to know what to ask for. You just need to reach out.

I didn’t start out knowing who to talk to or what to ask for. I started by asking one person… and they knew people in offices I didn’t know existed. MIT has offices full of people who spend their days listening and thinking of innovative ways to support the people here. The most critical piece of help that I got was someone listening to me and reminding me that I am capable of handling everything (thanks Justin!).

In my first month at MIT, I got help from:

- My academic advisor (Professor Voldman is the 🐐)

- Student Support Services (S3)

- MIT Health

- MIT Mental Health

- The professors and TAs teaching my classes

- MIT Undergraduate Advising Center (UAC)

- Student Veteran Success (SVS)

- Course 8 Academic Support Staff

- Disability and Accessibility Services (DAS)

- MIT Police & EMS

- MIT Admissions

This didn’t happen all at once. It started with an email to my academic advisor, then a phone call, then a couple of meetings (virtual and in-person) with some of these offices. Before I knew it, people I didn’t know existed were helping me solve my problems in ways I didn’t know they could be solved. For some offices, I just showed up and people either helped me right then or pointed me in the right direction.

I just finished my first semester. I didn’t struggle to complete any of my classes. All of the problems I listed earlier are resolved (except my car, which is fixed; I’m picking it up from the shop right after break). I’m looking forward to visiting my family during the break. When I return to MIT next semester, I’ll be doing it knowing something I didn’t know before: having a bad start to a semester doesn’t mean I’ll have a bad ending.

If I need help, all I have to do is ask.

Hi everybody, I’m Warren! I moved to Cambridge from Hawaii, one of the several places I was stationed during my 12+ years in the U.S. Navy. On my route to transferring to MIT in September 2024, I attended a small liberal arts college, a large flagship state university, a couple of community colleges and some Navy schools. At MIT I’m planning on double-majoring in 6-2 and 4-B, but I’m also interested in a bunch of classes in courses 2, 11, 15, and 22.

I graduated from high school in Memphis, TN and grew up in the South. On campus you can find me creating stuff in one of MIT’s many makerspaces or waiting in line at Bosworth’s for a warm drink (Bosworth’s exists in the 4th dimension and fits into ANY walking route through campus). This year I learned that rivers can freeze and that molasses is a deadly substance that can kill people.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WK_Picture1.jpg,1
Final projects from the fall,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",0,2025-01-16T00:00:00-05:00,"I had four final projects this past semester. As busy as I was for the last several weeks of the semester, I was so relieved that I didn’t have exams. I love making things, and I hate exams.

6.8371 – Digital and Computational Photography

Final report

I only took this class because the course ratings were high, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes that I’ve taken. We learned how to create image-editing effects in C++ that would normally take much longer to replicate manually in Photoshop.

My favorite pset was about autostitching, or automatically stitching together separate images of the same scene. Autostitching can be used to make panorama shots and even “mini-planet” images, like this! (credit: 6.8371 staff, NASA)

We were given a list of options to choose from for our final project. I chose “Deconvolution and Poisson Image Editing.” Basically, image deconvolution tries to make an image clearer by algorithmically undoing optical distortions and blurring effects, while Poisson image editing is a method of automatically combining two images together in a way that looks seamless and natural as possible.

Image deconvolution

Poisson image editing — it’s hard to tell but the “WOW” is in uppercase

6.4210 – Robotic Manipulation

Research paper and presentation

Nora (one of my roommates from freshman year) and I teamed up to work on a simulated robotic arm that can detect and stack cups into a pyramid. Spoiler: it works!



We aren’t controlling the bot; it’s moving by itself! The visual perception system uses depth image input from RGB-D cameras to locate where the cups are in the environment, and the grasp- and motion-planning system uses inverse kinematics to maneuver the cups with the robot hand.

Cool slide from our presentation

More cool words

We coded this with the Python version of Drake, which can be used for creating robotics simulations like these. A lot of time was spent trying to understand the documentation and how to make sense of Drake in general, but we were miraculously able to deliver the results that we wanted.

21W.744 – The Art of Comic Book Writing

Final script, and some storyboards

This class wasn’t about making an entire comic, but about writing the script for one. Although more rigorous than I expected, I really enjoyed doing the assignments and felt like I improved as a storyteller by the end.

Whether I actually improved or not is up for debate. I couldn’t decide what to write about for my final project, so I took a theory I have about Tom Cruise and wrote a 20-page script based on it. The final script is about an alien who crash-landed on Earth, and disguised himself as a Hollywood actor so he could get rich enough to buy a spaceship and return to his home planet. My professor had to read the whole thing with his own eyeballs.

The CliffNotes version

What matters is that I had fun. Also, I somehow got an A.

9.66/6.4120 – Computational Cognitive Science

Research paper

The final project generally had to be a model that attempts to reflect an aspect of human cognition in some way. Unfortunately, I procrastinated until I only had two weeks to work on it. Luckily, the TAs gave us a list of project ideas that we could choose from.

Based on one of the suggestions, I tried to make a Bayesian model for how a player’s confidence changes over the course of a word-guessing game, where they have to guess the letters in the mystery word (think Hangman or Wordle). “Confidence” means how confident the player feels that they know what the right word is.

I collected some data from friends, and then I coded a model that inputted every game state in a single game. A game state included which letters the player has guessed correctly/incorrectly so far. For each game state, the model returned (1) what word it thinks it is (2) how confident it is in its guess.

The player’s confidence over the course of a game, compared to the model’s confidence

The model didn’t do a good job at matching the data, as expected. I somehow pieced together a whole research paper with the results that I got. I even made the outrageous claim that this project had “possible implications” for how educators could model students’ confidence levels from test results. Somehow, I got a decent grade.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mars_planet.png

2.009: the product engineering process,Emiko P. '25,2,2025-01-16T00:00:00-05:00,"For some schools, the biggest events of the year are rambunctious homecoming weekends and rivalry football games broadcasted on ESPN. At MIT, though, nothing beats the energy and celebration of the 2.009 Prototype Launch – the biggest party of the year. Equipped with enough fanfare to welcome the Queen of England, including a DJ, acapella groups, dance teams, and ridiculous amounts of confetti, this event is a must-see for any MIT student.

The 2.009 Prototype Launch is the final presentation for one of the most famous classes at MIT – 2.009: the Product Engineering Process. It’s a capstone class for Mechanical Engineering seniors, where the students are broken up into six teams of about 15 people each, and you have 12 weeks to create a prototype and present it to a live audience of over 1000 people.

How the final presentation itself went is pretty well covered in this liveblog by Janet and Kayode, and you can watch the livestream itself here, so I will focus more on the 2.009 experience as a student and walk you all through my team’s process throughout the semester.

Let’s start with my team: the Red Team. Somehow fate took all the smartest, funniest, and coolest people ever and put them all on this team. Your experience in 2.009 can depend a lot on your team, so I feel super lucky with how it worked out for me.

We had just 12 weeks to go from learning each other’s names to presenting our product, the world’s first ever powered respirator for wildland firefighters, in MIT’s biggest auditorium. Come and see how we did it.

6 opportunities in 6 minutes: 12 weeks until launch!

Getting 17 people on the same page is not an easy feat, which became immediately clear after Red Team’s very first meeting. We were tasked with coming up with six “opportunity spaces,” which we would be pitching to our entire class later that week. 

As we were coming up with ideas in our brainstorming session, things were steadily getting more tense between the team. What the heck is an “opportunity” anyway? We began to bicker, as we all had different definitions for what we were supposed to be working on. Is an “opportunity” broad (ex: Fires) or specific (ex: Fires caused by lithium ion batteries in landfills)? It goes to show how important being on the same page would be for our team.

Not going to lie, I was a bit nervous leaving that first meeting. What if the semester would be fraught with drama? I was already getting the sense that the social and personal aspect of the class would be just as important as the actual engineering.

We regrouped a day later, with a fresh slate and with a definition for what would actually constitute an opportunity (which turned out to be somewhere in the middle of broad and specific, for example: Fires in landfills), and from that point on, we learned to manage and communicate any conflicts without nearly as much tension and frustration as that first meeting.

It was from that moment on that The Red Team started becoming a 
        powerhouse.
      


Later that week, we presented our six opportunities, which ranged from railway safety to food waste management to containing forest fires.



Feasibility Model Presentation: 10 weeks until launch!

Taking inspiration from the six opportunities, we narrowed down our pool to four different ideas. First, we had to identify the Killer Question, aka what is the one thing that would kill our product’s viability. Second, we had to build a model demonstrating an answer to this Killer Question, which could either be a technical model (some code and math demonstrating that a product would work) or a physical model.

Our four ideas included an urban sapling hydration system, a dysautonomia exercise aid, a geothermal drilling noise mitigation device, and a wildland firefighting mask (which is the one we ended up going with). Just to show you guys an example, the Killer Question for the wildland firefighting mask was: Can we provide both sufficient filtration and breathability? Wearing something like an N95 mask is uncomfortable on its own – now imagine wearing a mask while running a marathon, wearing at least 40 pounds of gear, and being surrounded by an out-of-control wildfire. A product like this would not be viable. 

Our answer to this killer question was this: A battery-powered system that allows for high filtration without sacrificing the breathability and comfort of the user. We created a model to show that this solution was feasible, by doing a power calculation as well as an airflow calculation to show that it was possible to assist airflow enough to ease the comfort of the user while also using a reasonable number of batteries.



Team Build Challenge: 9 weeks until launch!

Fun team bonding! This was a challenge where each team would be racing to complete an obstacle course. The goal was to transport 100 water balloons to the end of the course using mechanisms we had built in lab earlier that week. I’ve never screamed and laughed so hard – especially when our first mechanism immediately failed and we were forced to bypass the first obstacle by frantically jumping in a potato sack. Pink team won the challenge this year! And you can only imagine what happened after the challenge was over… It’s not like we were going to let six hundred water balloons go to waste.

Concept Review: 8 weeks until launch!

We down selected from our four ideas and went forward with the Wildland Firefighting Respirator. Wildland firefighters are an interesting user group because, unlike firefighters who put out fires inside of buildings, wildland firefighters rarely wear masks out in the field. And if they do, it’s usually just a bandana soaked in water. The brave firefighters defending our homes and land deserve a safer solution – an issue that has unfortunately become even more dire due to the recent wildfires ripping through LA. With not a single powered respirator for wildland firefighters existing on the market, we decided we would create the first. 

The Concept Review was basically an elevator pitch of our concept: a battery-powered wildland firefighter respirator with a focus on comfort and safety. At this point, we were doing as many user interviews as possible by building our contacts within the wildland firefighter community. These interviews helped us pinpoint features that would make them want to wear our respirator versus what would drive them away.



Architecture Review: 6 weeks until launch!

We were halfway through the semester! By this point, we had made some key progress, including:

- Fan selection.

- Filter selection.

- Diffuser testing.

- Preliminary PCB design.

- Power specs.

- Mask components. 

- Preliminary CAD assembly.

During Architecture Review, we presented our progress, answered questions from professors, defended our design decisions, and breathed a sigh of relief that it all went smoothly. Then, we got ready to take a much needed break – SIKE!!! Only six weeks until product launch (one of these weeks being Thanksgiving break) and you think we’re taking a break??? No way.



Technical Review: 3 weeks until launch!

We continued iterating on our product based off of the advice given to us during Architecture Review. After three weeks of hard work, we finally had our first functioning prototype of Vortex. During Technical Review, we demonstrated the prototype to our professors in our manufacturing lab, Pappalardo, where they gave us some final feedback for our product. 

And with that, we had only a few weeks to integrate all these changes and build not one, but two, final prototypes for the Final Presentation. The team put in so many hours during this final sprint, and there was always someone to be found downstairs in the lab. We were machining, sewing, assembling, soldering, setting things on fire, and praying that everything went smoothly. Miraculously, this hard work paid off and we had our final prototypes done two days before the Final Presentation. The feeling of seeing the final product can only be described as exhilarating.

Final Presentation: prototype launch!

Peeking behind the towering curtains of MIT’s biggest stage, all you could see was an undulating, feral crowd of nerds waving rainbow pom poms and cheering at the top of their lungs.

The day had finally arrived.

It was time to present Vortex, our powered respirator for wildland firefighters. Our three presenters stepped onstage to the sound of deafening applause, and the rest of the team stood backstage, watching with bated breath. 

The crowd cheered as we demonstrated the features of our product, and when we announced that Vortex was capable of filtering air to be 
        200x cleaner,
      
 the applause was thunderous. 

The Prototype Launch was an awesome experience. I remember watching these presentations every year for the past three years and thinking, How in the world did they make that in a semester? Now I know. 



Personal Reflections

The design process has a bunch of phases, as you can tell from the breakdown of the weeks I just outlined. One of my favorite phases was the ideation phase. The brainstorming meetings with the team were awesome – especially when an idea pitched by one team member would snowball, collecting ideas and feedback from the rest of the team, and turn into a really exciting prospect. 

Although the development process was a grind and probably the most frustrating part for me personally, it was so rewarding that it was also one of my favorite phases of the design process. I was on the Manufacturing Team with two other team members, and we were responsible for figuring out what materials our product was going to be made out of and how. We played around with composites, 3D printing, and molding. For the final product, I was working on the lathe to machine the cap to our filter and was working on other miscellaneous integration steps that had to be done to assemble our many parts together. I think one of my favorite days of the entire semester was when we finished integrating the final product just as the cleanup music in the lab started playing at 9 pm. 5 minutes later, we were all kicked out of lab, but we had beautiful pictures of our final product, and in our Slack channel, everyone was basking in the glory of our hard work. 

Something else I learned is that the design process is not perfect. You don’t just stumble upon a gold mine of an idea. You have to research. You have to talk to as many users as possible. You have to be willing to pivot if you learn that your idea is already patented, physically impossible, or nobody’s going to use it. You have to keep trying and iterating and building. And maybe most importantly of all, you have to work as a team.

The Red Team was awesome throughout this whole process. We kept each other accountable but also were willing to hold out a hand when people were falling behind or needed help. Vortex is the result of 17 brains coming together and transforming an idea into a product, creating the world’s first ever battery-powered mask for wildland firefighters. This project was so fun!!

Thank you to the amazing staff of 2.009, especially the instructors and the Pappalardo shop crew, and congrats to the Red, Yellow, Purple, Pink, Blue, and Green Teams on designing some super sick products. I’m excited to see where this class of Mechanical Engineers goes :)

And with that, we wrap up a semester of 2.009 and a semester of Breathing Easy and Battling Hard with Vortex.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opportunities-400x267.jpeg

MARC 2025 (not a live blog),Anika H. '26,0,2025-01-16T00:00:00-05:00,"MARC is one of the few conferences people have in their academic career where you should absolutely go whether you consider your research good or not. Because for good food, new friends, subsidized ski trips, and a stay at a luxury hotel that looks like the one from The Shining, why would you not go?

If you haven’t yet read either of Andi ’25’s blogs on MARC, it’s MIT’s Microsystems Annual Research Conference where we present all of our really cool research to the big industry sponsors funding us. And so, MIT tries to get as many researchers as possible to come to this by bribing us with things we would otherwise not be able to afford with the average broke-college-student budget.

Andi and I were both on Bus 3, so I sat next to him and we yapped incessantly about research and pigeons until we got to the ski site.

Skiing!

I missed the signup for downhill skiing, so I went cross country skiing instead. Unlike my research supervisor (Hans), I didn’t know how to ski, so I ended up slowing him down a whole lot. Skate skis are a lot easier to learn since they’re similar to ice skating where you push to the side, but it was also a lot more annoying in the beginning because it felt like I was wearing very long clown shoes.

Hans was not anticipating winter activities and ended up cross country skiing with a coat over his formalwear, so I couldn’t really pelt him with snowballs. The trails themselves were quite fun with a lot of uphill and downhill sections. We started with a couple wrong turns, but managed to get back in time within the last hour. At the end, after poking several trees and falling  several times, I walked back into the ski rental lodge lobby with snow in my boots and icicles in my hair, grinning as I lied about getting the hang of things. I don’t think I wiped out as bad as Andi did, but I was flopping around quite a bit in the beginning.

Indoor Time

When we were waiting for hotel check in to start, I got to see my grad student friends (Daniel and Ben) getting worked like hounds to finish an IC (integrated circuit) tape out before the deadline which just so happened to be the first day of MARC. While Hans took a nap and I wandered around the basement, the two posted up in the business room with their eyes glued to their laptops. I think they went straight to sleep after they finished. During one of the social hours, I found a bunch of my fellow undergrads, many of whom were here to present their final projects from the nano fabrication class (6.254). We quickly became friends from talking throughout the day.

At dinner, our table name for trivia was “The Kids Table (+Hans) (+Dohyun)”. While Andi seemed to be diligently take notes on the panel happening afterwards, I went back to my room to take a fat nap, having only gotten 4 hours of sleep the previous night. I hauled my butt up in time for the group photo, but I’m pretty sure I sneezed as the camera flashed the first time.

I played poker with Kat in the evening. Through her prowess in social deception, a keen eye, and a pure skill, Kat ended up with the dragon’s hoard of wealth by the end of the game.

Nope, just kidding. None of us knew how to play poker so we all got kicked to the noob table. We didn’t really get to bluff or anything since we were all showing our hands to the dealer and he would tell us out loud “you can still stay in the game, put 200 in”, or “you got a crap load of nothin’!” And tell us to fold. He took pity on the losers and tossed us extra chips to keep playing if we ran low. For the last round, everyone went all in, and Kat won the whole pot with all 4 aces.

We roasted marshmallows in the fire pit outside until we all got too cold. As we were walking back to our hotel rooms, I was giving out some terrible advice as a joke and was heard very clearly and very out of context by Dohyun when he passed us in the hall. I think what we said is a little heinous for the blogs, judging by the expression he had on his face.

 

Day 2: Pitches and Posters

I only managed to sit through about 10 minutes of the keynote speakers before deciding it was far more interesting to go frolic in the snow. I don’t particularly enjoy listening to talks about AI or startups, but that’s just me.

it’s tim!

I didn’t do the pitch because I wasn’t too sure on what the vibes were when the signups opened, but it was a lot more casual than I expected. Each pitch is 60 seconds long, and they honk a rubber chicken at you if you go overtime. The ones presented were all interesting, with some people cracking jokes and even singing. Some of my friends did a pitch together about the supercapacitor they made for their final project in the nano fab class and did an amazing job with the energy they brought on stage. Everyone voted for their favorite pitches, and they were one of five groups that won! I’m fairly certain people all voted for the pitches with the most whimsy.

the dream team! frank, emillia, and kenneth from left to right

I made up for the lack of public speaking with the poster session, because I got absolutely GRILLED. People were asking me question after question, and I could barely run away from my spot to look at other people’s research. I had to dig the depths of my brain to find details from papers I read months ago, and awkwardly point them to my references section whenever I wasn’t confident about what I said. I wasn’t sure whether I got so much interaction because people were genuinely interested in my research, or because I explained it in a confusing enough manner that people were just looking for clarification.

my research poster!

Yapping about magnetic resonance for an hour straight took a lot out of me, but I was free to look at everyone else’s groundbreaking research afterwards in everything from Lidar photonics to mini somersaulting robots. I got to talk to one researcher who was working 3D printed magnets, but was limited by the size and strength of the electromagnet used to magnetize them. Naturally, I offered to let her use the 6000 pound elevator-sinking electromagnet that I was using for my research too. As a side note, it did actually slowly sink the building 36 freight elevator, which is why we left it on the first floor instead of trying to put it into our lab on the 7th floor.

the giant elevator-sinking magnet in question

The food was really good. Aside from getting very fancy meals for dinner, breakfast, and lunch, we were basically fed every hour with cookies and refreshments in between. During the very last round of refreshments after the second poster session, I was delighted to find a jug of whole milk next to the half-and-half. Though I’m sure it was meant to be mixed with the coffee, I poured myself a full cup of milk since we were nearing the end of the conference anyway.

This was my very first research conference ever, and I couldn’t have imagined a better one.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-16-400x400.jpg

what I’m doing this IAP,Kai V. '25,1,2025-01-16T00:00:00-05:00,"MIT has an Independent Activities Period, which we call IAP, during the month of January: some people treat it as a four-week extension on winter break, some people take classes or work on campus, lots of people are holding cool events and workshops.

IAP is my favorite time of year. It’s cold and dark and quiet outside; the river has frozen over; some mornings, any inch of skin exposed to the air goes numb in minutes. But this means the sunlight feels so bright (when it’s there) and hotpot with friends is justified (people are less busy than during the semester, and colder and hungrier) and a whole host of possibilities are available that get pushed to the back of my mind during the school year.

All my previous IAPs have been really fun. In freshman year, I did 
        MITOC winter school
      
, worked on my plasma physics UROP, and spent twenty hours a week on 
        SEVT
      
. In sophomore year, I helped with the Pi Day video animation and grinded for Battlecode with two of my friends. In junior year, I worked on a nuclear security UROP from 9-5 every day (though I was usually there more like 8-6), and when I got off work I’d walk to the climbing gym or the pool, and then cook dinner with friends.

This IAP I’m doing some similarly fun things! The things I’m doing that are new to IAP:

- I’m taking 8.08: Statistical Physics II. It’s a 12-unit class (the same as a normal class over the full semester) squished into four weeks, so it’s quite intense; we have two hours of lecture and one hour of recitation every weekday, and a lengthy pset each week. I’m keeping up with the material fine but I do feel like I need to figure out how to synthesize my knowledge, since the class goes at a rapid pace that doesn’t allow for much reflection. Though the focus is statistical physics, the class delves into more general stochastic methods applied to biology or economics. Actually, much of the formalism used is the same as in quantum mechanics, even though we’re describing totally classical systems. So I’m excited to see where this leads and how to apply it to broader situations than a colloid floating in a fluid (which is what we’ve been talking about for two weeks).

- I’m part of the ensemble for 
        MTG’s
      
 production of Cabaret; putting on a show within 4 weeks is pretty hard, the rehearsals are beginning to amp up, and next week we’ll be starting to practice full runs of the show. I’ve wanted to audition for a musical since I got to MIT and saw MTG’s Firebringer in freshman fall. I have no performing experience, but musicals hit me in a way that no other medium has accomplished, and I knew I wanted to be part of one—I just kept psyching myself out of auditioning, year after year, because I knew I would suck compared to the other candidates (and I did!). I think one of my most fulfilling experiences in all my time at MIT was acting as sound engineer for Into the Woods in freshman year. I was crying every night we put on that show, which is crazy, because you just know every beat of the show after a few runs through. Musicals are such a blatant expression of emotion—Kano put it so well in her blog, that each song can act as (among other things) a window into how the characters are really feeling, with none of the requirements of realism or social conformity that straight acting is under. It’s a really special medium. I was looking forward most to singing and dancing, but I’ve also had to act a bit (in a minor background role) and that has been surprisingly really fun.

Some more things I usually do anyway:

- I’ve been bouldering—during the semester I go around twice a week; I’m trying to go more often now that I (in theory) have more time, or at least fewer deadlines. It can be a bit frustrating since I’m at this unfortunate stage where all the problems of a certain grade feel trivial to me, and all the problems of the next grade up feel super hard. But this means I am forced to push myself every time I go, and to appreciate smaller milestones—e.g. making it to a part of a problem that I couldn’t reach last time, even if sending the whole thing still seems impossible.

- Reading! I so don’t read enough, especially for someone who takes writing semi-seriously. I’ve been trying to read a bit every day before bed, with varying success. Currently I’m reading The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes and really enjoying it.

- Retaking figure skating. I did fine in this class in the fall! But you’re allowed to retake a PE class and I’d definitely benefit from additional structured practice, so I just registered for it again and am going twice a week during IAP. One of my goals for 2025 is to do a single toe loop (lol the most basic jump yes). Will it happen this January?? I WILL make a whole post about it if it happens. I’ll record myself doing it. You’ll see.

- Food… IAP is a weird time for meals if you’re not on a dining hall plan, but fortunately I live at pika and we have a mealplan that anyone can join! I have one cook shift a week and get to eat yummy food every night for free as a result :)",,0
[Guest Post] Your Guide to Boston Cafes,Jessica Z. '27,2,2025-01-15T00:00:00-05:00,"Jess: This is a guest post by my friend Grace Z. ’25! I met her through a summer program last year and we’ve since bonded over concerts, good food, and all MIT assorted things. I invited her to write a post, and this is that! I loved reading it, and I know you will too <3

Dear fellow chompers,

A year ago, I was asked:



… and in typical hosed-MIT-student fashion, I forgot to respond. 

For context, I’m chomps – a foodie and ’25 at MIT. I created @grx.chomps (originally @grxeats) during my freshman year as a private diary to document my food adventures in college. While some foodies see themselves as critics or connoisseurs, I prefer the term “food enjoyer”—an avid chomper, if you will.

Cafes are my favorite niche; versatile and diverse, they offer a quick yet intimate glimpse into a community’s tastes. If I’ve learned anything, tastes reveal much about individuals and their communities, and coffee, in particular, carries rich traditions. Across many cultures, the cherished drink is more than just liquid in a cup; it is a daily ritual that brings together families and friends. 

Two years ago, during my sophomore IAP, my 30 in 30 challenge introduced me to 30 cafes in the Greater Boston area, and since then, I’ve chomped at over 60! These cafes celebrate a variety of cuisines, flavors, and stories, so without further ado, I present you with



Note: I use the T for all my cafe hops, so my location references are in relation to MBTA stations.

If you’re looking for a cafe with delicious food…

This is a collection of my all-around favorite cafes in Boston. A diverse selection geographically and gastronomically, you can’t go wrong with these six.

- Phin Coffee House Downtown Boston, 5-10 minute walk from Red line stations Downtown Crossing and South Station My go-to Sunday pick me up spot, Phin offers a relaxed study space with a menu combining Vietnamese and Western classics. Some of my favorites include their noodle salad and banh mi for food and the Boston cream latte and Ca Phe Phin (a traditional Vietnamese drink prepared with Robusta beans and condensed milk) for drinks. 
Founded by owners from Ho Chi Minh City, Phin brings the “bold, distinctive flavors of Vietnamese coffee culture” to Boston. Their carefully crafted menu draws inspiration from the traditional methods and techniques they fell in love with while growing up in Vietnam. The team is always looking to innovate, so keep an eye out for the debut of Phin’s Vietnamese egg coffee, “a rich, creamy drink that’s a true highlight of Vietnamese coffee culture.”

- Gypsy Place Coffee & Juice Bar Cambridge, 15 minute walk from campus Gypsy is a cozy Bohemian cafe offering a variety of coffee, smoothies, and acai bowls. Manager Petya Todorova and her team envisioned a space where they could “feel at home” and believe that “good vibes start from the inside,” which is reflected in their menu featuring healthy and tasty options. When I asked about their favorite item, they referred me to the Topaz Smoothie – a blend of acai, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, banana, and milk). As a best seller, it remains the only item unchanged since the cafe first opened.

- Greystone Cafe, Bakery and Provisions South End, 5-10 minute walk from Orange line station Back Bay 
Greystone, founded by mother-daughter duo Patty and Jacqueline is named after the street Jacqueline grew up on and Patty still calls home. With a walk-up window and indoor seating, the cafe offers coffee, house-made pastries, and sandwiches. Many of the recipes like cowboy cookies, apple cake, Texas Trash are longtime favorites developed by Patty and tested by the bakery and kitchen team. Jacqueline told me her favorite menu item is Greystone’s chocolate chip cookie – “in the cold winter, there is nothing better than a warm chocolate chip cookie with salt on top.” I enjoyed their breakfast sammie – it was a tasty and comforting way to start my day.

- Bom Dough 2 locations in Cambridge: Inman Square and East Cambridge (both 15-20 minute walk from campus) Bom Dough, meaning “good dough” in Portuguese, offers comfort food with a twist. President Marcia Chemim opened the cafe to “create a space where people could enjoy high quality food,” especially inspired by her team’s Brazilian roots. In particular, pão de queijo, a gluten-free cheesy bread, has always been a special part of Chemim’s life, and if she had to choose a favorite, it would be the Doce de Leite Pão de Queijo, which took “72 tries to perfect the recipe, and every step of that journey made it even more meaningful.” Some of my favorites – crack chicken sandwich, brigadeiro cookie for food and the peach or strawberry matcha for drinks.

Gumnod Nakapandhu is the manager and head chef; before moving to Boston where he took culinary classes, Nakapandhu owned a restaurant in Bangkok. Maprang began when a group of friends connected over exchanging recipes and debating ways to improve them, leading to a collaborative menu of recipes the team experimented with and perfected together. I love their Thai tea cake – it’s light and spongy, not too sweet and the Thai tea flavor shines through; they also recommend the basque burnt cheesecake which comes in the ube, Thai tea, and original flavors.

- Honorable mention: Curio Coffee Cambridge, Inman Square, 15 minute walk from campus Curio’s liège waffle has earned the title of “Best Waffle in Massachusetts” from Yelp and named as “quite possibly the best caffeine companion in town” and deservedly so. I always mention this cafe when asked for recs – likely because their liège waffle is always on my mind.

shifting seasons,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",2,2025-01-15T00:00:00-05:00,"mementos

high school has been on my mind, lately. it’s been almost five years, and only now do i feel comfortable dusting off the little box where it lives in my mind and peering at what lies within.

some of this unboxing was literal — i visited my family’s place in vancouver over winter break. our belongings are still mostly sealed away in boxes and suitcases, since my parents are overseas and i’m in boston, so most of these old memories have been left to gather dust over the years. after i burned through my high-speed data for canada, there wasn’t much to do on my phone so i started poking around the house.

there were lots of goodies that were a pleasant surprise — a plethora of beautiful vintage bird stamps, two bags full of my old copic markers (expensive!), a couple prints made by my old watercolor teacher.

old things i found

and then there were my yearbooks, and the various memorabilia associated with my school. if i’m remembering correctly, my graduation gifts consisted of a bizarre assortment: a cigar, a blue cowbell, 2020 glasses, cheap branded headphones, and a bundt cake. i found the headphones and the cowbell and the rest were either eaten or lost to the tides of time.

one item in particular stuck with me. every semester, for teacher-parent conferences i guess, teachers would write comments about how students were doing and what they were learning. i skimmed through many iterations of “a pleasure to have in class” and “needs to be more confident” before i saw what my sophomore year biology teacher wrote.

“one thing is clear: mel loves biology.” he talked about how my eyes would light up at anything we talked about in class, my extensive yet beautiful notes (back when i was into that sort of thing for studygram/studyblr), and his confidence in my potential as a scientist.

i felt my eyes burn, and i put it down.

i’ve always struggled with believing people when they say they believe in me. this was especially hard around graduation — it was a blur of festivities, photos, and encouraging cards that was over almost as soon as it started. somehow, it felt almost shameful to admit my grief when everyone else seemed so excited and happy. i didn’t want to spoil it for anyone.

in my last group therapy session, and my last lab meeting, people kept telling me how proud they were of me, how much i had impacted them, and i cried a lot, and i let people assume that they were (mostly) happy tears.

i spent the summer and fall semester trying to work through those emotions. what i landed on was that when the people i trust say that they believe in me, i owe to myself and to them to believe them. i trust that they wouldn’t lie to me, so i have to trust that they’re telling the truth — that i am capable, that i can do it.

this is something much easier said than done, and i ended fall semester on a bit of a low note, but break gave me the time i needed to reflect.

i’ve come so far since my shy, awkward high school self. being at mit has helped me come out of my shell more than anything. i’m so much better at identifying what i need, and how to go about fulfilling those, and how to help others fulfill their needs too.

 

connecting

somehow, i ended up being a teaching assistant for a 3 month biology class aimed at high schoolers. after the first couple sessions, i started feeling so grateful for all of the wonderful professors and instructors i had when mit was online, because engaging high schoolers over zoom is like trying to get a stray cat to come closer. sometimes your efforts and “pspsps”s will work, and other times you’ll just be met with complete and utter silence.

but, hey, i get it. turning on your camera and talking requires a certain kind of confidence that comes from learning to care less about what other people think, and that’s something i didn’t gain until college.

so i adapted. every time we went into breakout rooms, i’d start by asking them how they were doing on a scale of 1-10, and how well they understood the content we just covered on a scale of 1-10. it was kind of like a twitch stream, except the chat was only visible to me, because they would just send me direct messages instead of typing it to everyone, but i could still work with that.

and then i’d go into asking if people had questions, and answering the questions i did get to the best of my ability. i tried to always keep it real with them, because that’s what i always appreciated about my favorite teaching assistants. and i also tried to never make anyone feel bad for not answering — i’d always try to rephrase the question multiple times, something i noticed a professor of mine doing in a class i was taking that semester.

towards the end, even though i had no idea what most of these kids looked like, i felt like i was getting a sense of their personalities and strengths, and they were (maybe) warming up to me.

after it was over, i received a very sweet message from one student:

I just wanted to thank you for being such a great TA. You always made our after lecture discussions a comfortable space for me to ask questions and I always appreciate how thorough you are with your answers. I also appreciate your little 1-10 scale check-ins and effort to connect with us. I know it must’ve been awkward being the only one with your camera on, I wish I could’ve interacted with you more though zoom videos can be a little intimidating 😅 Overall you seem like a really warm (and smart!) person and I enjoyed my time in this program!

which…



being a high schooler is tough, man. being a high schooler in an online class that you may or may not be invested in is even tougher. i’ve been there. but i’m glad i could make a difference.

 

reconnecting

i only talk to two people from high school. granted, my school was tiny; there were around 90 kids in my grade. i lost touch with most of them because i moved right after graduating, and i also don’t use instagram all that much these days — mostly because scrolling feels more like a chore there than anything.

with the two people i do talk to, it’s very sporadic and we often go long periods without exchanging any messages. but we still somehow keep each other updated on the important things.

in the past couple of days, the stars aligned and i ended up reconnecting with both of them.

quinn was my partner in crime when it came to high school journalism, and i ended up getting lunch with her over the summer in minnesota when i visited with chris (the first time i returned in almost four years). she has a penchant for sending wonderfully hilarious and informative audio messages, which i’ve always loved about her, and i was lucky enough to get a series of them yesterday. i listened to them on my walk to campus to pick up my monthly t-pass (since you can get a discounted pass as an mit student, and especially as a grad student as long as you make a request ahead of time) and my meds. it made me so happy.

ryan was the first friend i made in high school and we were quite the dynamic duo. we got up to all kinds of shenanigans — depleting snack bins that were technically off-limits and driving circles around my block, talking about everything and anything in our little teenage lives. i was in the central square target buying cat food and listening to pearl jam when i got a call from him. there was some brief reshuffling in which i had to call him back because my airpods weren’t putting anything through, but then we were talking like old times again while i walked up and down the home aisle, trying to balance everything in my hands and also musing on whether i should buy a plastic wastebin to wash my bulky wool sweaters in.

(i did not end up buying the wastebin, but i did buy a tub scrubber with a long handle, so i’m hoping that i can get the bathtub really clean and do a big wash session in there instead.)

it felt really good to hear their voices again, grainy and crackled through my phone. they both sound older and wiser. we’ve all grown a lot. and this is famously a strange time in our lives — we’ve graduated from college and we’re trying to figure out what our next steps are going to be. but just as i said to ryan, no matter how confusing things get, i know we’ll always be in each other’s corners through these changing seasons of our lives.

so, for 2025 i’ll love my friends, try new things, and get a little silly with it. i’ll handle the roadbumps as they come. i know i will.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4246-1000x1333.jpg

[Liveblog] MARC 2025,Andi Q. '25,2,2025-01-14T00:00:00-05:00,"Day 1, 6 PM

Today is the first day of MARC 2025 (the Microsystems Annual Research Conference) – MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratory’s (MTL) annual conference, featuring two days of MIT students presenting their research to MTL’s industry sponsors like Lam Research and GlobalFoundries. It’s also a (heavily subsidized) ski trip! Because MARC isn’t only about serious science; it’s also an opportunity for the MTL community to get together and have fun before the spring semester starts.

Unlike last year, when I tagged along at MARC despite my nonexistent research output (I guess being an undergrad made it okay), I have a poster to present this year! (Stay tuned until day 2 to see it.) Also unlike last year, when our blogs were restricted to use only the top 1000 most common English words, I can describe things in a non-caveman-like way this year! Goodbye “sticking-together rocks”; hello “magnets”!

Anika ’26 is here too, which was a pleasant surprise!

I look dead inside here, but I assure you I was very excited for the conference. It was just that I had to wake up at 6 AM.

The conference kicked off at 10 AM with “winter activities” at the ski resort by our hotel. I went snowboarding, while Anika went cross-country skiing. It was my first time ever snowboarding; I went skiing last year during MARC and thought the snowboarding people looked so cool, so I decided to give it a shot this year.

Unfortunately, I severely underestimated the difficulty of snowboarding, which I quickly realized as I fell onto my face within the first ten seconds of going down the bunny slope. It turns out that snowboarding is completely different from skiing, skateboarding, or any other sport I’ve tried before. It’s fast, terrifying, and cold. (Just like MIT.) But it was really fun and I loved it, even though my body now hurts everywhere because I kept falling on my face. (Just like MIT.)

Pictures taken moments before disaster

I heard Anika had a great time cross-country skiing though, with none of the wipeouts I endured during snowboarding.

Anyway, after all that excitement, we got to the hotel and checked in. I’m currently sitting in the lobby writing this post while I wait for the opening ceremony (and dinner!) to begin. Be back in ~1 hour.

Day 1, 9 PM

Ok, so that was much longer than 1 hour, but the opening banquet had a lot going on and it felt wrong to pull out my laptop (under my seat) and blog during dinner. But now it’s time for the conference’s evening activities, so I finally have a chance to update you on what happened.

The banquet started with Professor Tomas Palacios (director of MTL) giving a presentation with opening remarks. Apparently, MARC has over 300 people attending this year! Anyway, Professor Palacios has a very… unique style of presentation that is best experienced visually. (Apologies in advance for the jank pictures.)

Part 3:

Next, there was an MTL-themed trivia game. Even though we got ~10 people per team, the questions were still rather tricky. Try to see how many of these you can answer (without Googling)!

- 
Name the iPod series that had seven generations between 2005 and 2012, included the first iPod with a video camera, and had iPods with both click wheels and touch screens.

- What does “CHIPS” stand for in “CHIPS Act”?

- What is the band gap of intrinsic silicon?

Nobody at my table knew what “CHIPS” stood for, so we guessed “creating happy international packaged semiconductors”. Somehow, this still sounds more realistic than the real answer.

After dinner, there was an “academia vs. industry” panel, with four MIT professors and three industry representatives from Lam Research, IBM, and GlobalFoundries:

- Q: “From an R&D perspective, how does industry benefit from the relative freedom and higher risk tolerance of academic research?” Lam Research: Academic research is cool because it helps them identify potentially disruptive technologies from the earliest stages of development, like soft robotics for equipment maintenance. Also, universities are uniquely set up to synthesize and test a huge range of different chemicals (albeit in small batches), whereas industrial processes are typically optimized for synthesizing a small handful of chemicals. IBM: They’re heavily involved in university research (particularly MIT) because “[they] cannot invent everything in industry”. It’s also great for “workforce development” (i.e., recruitment). GlobalFoundries: What Lam Research and IBM said.

- GlobalFoundries: What Lam Research and IBM said.

- Q: “How can universities structure their labs to align with industry needs while still adhering to the fundamental goal of original academic research?” Professor Jelena Notaros: Having access to industry know-how and tools often just means that research becomes more efficient. Also, original academic research still happens organically because the fresh minds of grad students naturally come up with new ideas that industry veterans may overlook. Professor Song Han: Having access to free GPUs is super helpful for AI research, and the industry needs are typically what the grad students want to research anyway. Having industry connections also helps expose students to real-world problems through internships, which can better inform their future research. Professor Duane Boning: It’s also often good not to align completely with industry needs, as orthogonal research directions from industry needs is often how the most disruptive new technologies get created.

- Q: “In your respective sectors, how does the pressure for immediate commercial outcomes influence your research, and does the pressure steer you away from fundamental research toward applied research? How do you balance it?” GlobalFoundries and IBM: (Idk I wasn’t paying attention to them, but their answers didn’t answer the question anyway.) Lam Research: It’s important to communicate the scope and time frame of projects with academic collaborators. Professors typically want funding for at least one year, which limits how short-term/immediate the research can be. Longer-term roadmaps allow for more fundamental research, and that’s often also what companies want anyway without realizing it. Professor Song Han: “We use short-term projects to generate cash flow for our long-term projects.”

(I stopped paying attention at this point because it was getting late and I was still physically exhausted from snowboarding earlier today. I think they just talked about the importance of recruitment until the end of the panel.)

It’s probably time for me to go to sleep now, so I’ll see you all tomorrow at 9 AM when the conference switches gear into academic mode.

Day 1, 9:45 PM

Oh actually, one more thing before I go – one of my friends mentioned that the hotel looks a lot like the Overlook Hotel from The Shining, and now I can’t unsee it.



Day 2, 7:30 AM

1.5 hours before the conference begins! Until then, check out this year’s entries for the MTL photo competition:

I think #15 (“Hitting the slopes at MARC”) looks the coolest, but #2 (“SEM photo of unknown particle on plastic substrate which is ruining my device ☹“) best captures the essence of microelectronics research.

Day 2, 9:30 AM

We started off the day with some opening remarks from Professor Vladimir Bulovic, director of MIT.nano. His talk was all about how it takes “just moments” to think of groundbreaking inventions, but several years (sometimes decades) to scale up those inventions to have a tangible impact on the world. Some examples he gave:

- Strained silicon: A processing technology that improves the charge carrier transport properties of silicon. Invented in 1990, but only became widely used in 2003 by Intel in chip manufacturing.

- High-κ dielectrics: Materials that can become more “polarizable” under an electric field, which allows for even smaller transistors. First measured in 1993, but only became used by IBM to create transistors in 2007.

- FinFETs: A transistor structure that uses 3D structure to improve performance. First patented in the 1980s, but only became widely used in 2011 by Intel in chip manufacturing. (Fun fact: FinFETs rely on the two innovations I mentioned above, so this is like innovation squared.)

It’s a bit depressing to think about how long it takes for academic research to become “useful”, but that’s exactly what MIT.nano and initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act are trying to change.

Another cool thing Professor Bulovic talked about was all the big players of the semiconductor industry that were MIT alumni:

- Cecil Green (MS 1924): Founder of Texas Instruments.

- William Shockley (PhD 1936): Co-inventor of the transistor.

- Morris Chang (MEng 1955): Founder of TSMC.

- Ray Stata (SM 1958; pronounced “stay-ta” not “stah-ta”): Founder of Analog Devices.

- Irwin Jacobs (PhD 1959): Founder of Qualcomm.

- Robert Metcalfe (BS 1969): Inventor of ethernet and much of the early internet.

- Robert Noyce (PhD 1953): Founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel.

Day 2, 10:30 AM

We have a 20-minute break before the poster sessions and 1-minute poster pitches (the most exciting non-ski part of the conference). Right before this, we had a keynote talk from Deirdre Hanford, CEO of Natcast. Natcast isn’t really a commercial company like IBM or Lam Research, but more a non-profit consortium that generally works to advance the US semiconductor industry.

The talk was mostly about the National Semiconductor Technology Center’s (NSTC) goals, like “extend US semiconductor leadership” and “reduce time and cost to prototype” – a lot of which was already discussed in earlier talks at MARC.

The talk also focused on the skyrocketing energy consumption of AI. For example, did you know that Google’s LLM-powered search results use more than 25x more energy than a traditional Google search? That Sam Altman wants to create an OpenAI datacenter that will consume as much power as Miami? And that datacenters in Virginia consume about a quarter of the state’s power? Once again, AI is the worst.

Day 2, 11 AM

Day 2, 1 PM

After the 1-minute pitch session, we had our first poster session of the day.



Here’s my poster:



And Anika’s!



I wish I could’ve walked around more to see what everyone else’s posters were about, but I had to stand near my poster and answer questions about it. Some of the questions people asked I didn’t know how to answer completely (e.g. “how do Josephson junctions work?”), which was a little scary, but they seemed okay with that.

Day 2, 1:30 PM

On a somewhat unrelated note, Professor Karl Berggren (the professor I do research with) is officially the new head of electrical engineering at MIT!

Day 2, 2:30 PM

I’m currently at a panel about transitioning from academia to startups. The panelists include two MTL-affiliated startup founders (the companies are FabuBlox and Active Surfaces), a founding partner of a venture capital firm, and Professor Dave Perrault (also a startup founder and head of house for Simmons). FabuBlox makes software for designing nanofabrication processes, while Active Surfaces makes printable solar panels that can stick onto any surface.

I’m not very entrepreneurial at all, but it was still interesting to hear from this panel because hardware and “deep tech” startups are much rarer than (and completely different from) software and AI startups that I’m more familiar with. The advice they gave was also very reasonable (none of that “drop out of MIT” that software startup bros tend to spew out):

- Take advantage of MIT’s patenting office (apparently this is a thing and they help you monetize your inventions) and other startup incubation resources. MIT really loves being affiliated with successful startups, so they will throw a lot of money at you to help you succeed.

- Do a lot of market research and think deeply about whether your idea is actually worth turning into a startup before dropping everything and starting a company.

- Don’t go around telling people about how your innovative new technology works, even if it is protected by patents. (This is the opposite of academia, where sharing knowledge in as much detail as possible is the norm.)

- Don’t do illegal things.

Day 2, 3 PM

Round 2 of poster pitches! (I forgot to link this previously, but you can match these descriptions to their official titles here.)

- Session 1: Materials Synthesis and Characterization S1.01: Semiconducting polymers that can detect neurotransmitters like dopamine. These polymers can help treat mental disorders caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. S1.02: A neural network that can precisely measure tiny angle differences between two overlapping 2D materials. S1.07: A robot that synthesizes graphene 24/7. (Graphene is actually quite hard to synthesize so I’m surprised that a robot can do this.) S1.08: A technique for synthesizing graphene with holes of controllable sizes.

A second poster session and some closing remarks later, and MARC 2025 is over! What a fun conference this has been. Anika and I are on the bus back to MIT now, but the adventure isn’t quite over yet – stay tuned for Anika’s version of events, coming to an MIT Admissions near you.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0621-1-800x600.jpg

[live blogging] astronomy field camp,Fatima A. '25,4,2025-01-14T00:00:00-05:00,"14/01/2025 20:00

this IAP, i am in Tenerife for 12.411 (astronomy field camp), which is an observational astronomy lab intensive class that satisfies the thesis requirement for astronomy minors and some unknown requirement for course 12 (earth and planetary science) majors. as part of the class, we work on various research projects, taking and reducing our own data. usually, we take projects various people are working on and obtain the data they need as part of a larger project. the class ends with final presentations and write-ups to the PI that explain the data taken and results deduced. today, i am observing at Artemis, which is a 1m optical infrared telescope part of the SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) program which hunts for exoplanets around cool stars. i am here with Jayna E. ’27 and since both of us are driving this for the first time, Jensen (TA) and Amius are teaching us how to use it. the procedure for running Artemis is fairly automated so I will be heading over to IAC-80 (80cm telescope) at some point and then, the observing shall continue until some point in the morning. Wahoo.

14/01/2025 22:01

we had to wait until around 8:40p for one of the exoplanet targets to become high enough to be visible because we were unclear on the exposure times. the way Artemis works is that you write a small operating plan for each of your targets with details of how you want it to be observed: filter, exposure time, binning etc. These files are chained together and input to a script which runs them automatically. So, you can let it run on its own once you have all the input files and leave early (wahoo). Dinner happened around 9-10p, then back to the grind!

notable things that happened during dinner: i got bullied by Prajna N. ’25, i was asked to publicly apologize to Prajna for bullying her, i dropped my fork, we learned that Jensen is a elder sibling, Jayna was bullied for being young (“i am 19” she screams).

14/01/2025 22:40

after double-checking scripts for the night, we headed over to IAC-80 (for the vibes, we didn’t have to). here, we joined Prajna and Zimi, the drivers, Artem (!!) (father of Artemis and one of our instructors), and Kaylee B. ’26 (who observed with me on IAC-80 and was teaching the others) and Matthew.

here, we learned that Jensen has watched Dhoom 2 and knows the song Amplifier (??), which was not on my bingo card for Tenerife. now, we are listening to banger Malayalam songs. i am not actually on observing duty for IAC-80 today, so i will be locking out and maybe fix my life and work on this blog.

15/01/2025 2:22

in my attempts to “fix my life,” i decided to look at graduate schools that require fall grades, which led to a long series of crying over graduate school applications, where i stressed out over grades, not having a focus, etc. among other things. in this time, Prajna submitted her last graduate school application (wahoo!) and the rest of us swam in a sea of anxiety while Jensen provided his wisdom.

some Ws that were had: Matthew put his best score on Minesweeper by 10 seconds (to 120 seconds)!! we found a supernova in a nice, big galaxy! we added another Koronis asteroid target! Jensen had a conversation in Spanish with the telescope operator which was very impressive. other than that, a lot of unhinged content was produced. the drivers want you to know that the seeing has gone up to 2.2, tragic.

driver quotes:

Prajna: “my mom thought i would never learn to drive but if she could look at me now” me: “she would be like you still can’t”

Zimi: “i hate when the machine learns more than i do”

the science.

today on the IAC-80, we are observing multiple supernovae and Koronis targets, which are (Prajna, Jayna)’s and (Zimi, Matthew)’s projects respectively. here is a bit about their projects: Matthew: One of my projects is focusing on the Koronis asteroid family. It’ll be part of a long-duration project tracking the rotation vectors of asteroids in the asteroid belt. It’s hypothesized that the Koronis family was once one larger asteroid that broke apart (possibly from a collision). By observing the current motion of the asteroids, we can go backwards to hopefully discover how the asteroids were formed :3

Zimi: The axes of rotation of the Koronis asteroids are all aligned in one of two directions, which is also strange (since over time, the directions should have randomized). If we observe an asteroid for 5 years, we can determine its axis of rotation! Some asteroids on our list will be observed for their 5th year this month :000 so exciting

Prajna: We are working on categorizing recently discovered supernovae using photometric data! Basically that means we hunt for transients that were discovered in the last couple days in large online databases, and try to observe their change in brightness using our lovely telescopes here. To be able to categorize supernovae, we need at least one week of continuous observations. The challenges are that 1) supernovae can either brighten or fade in the few days past initial discovery and if we catch them in the fading part of the curve, they may be too faint to see in our images for a full week of observations 2) sometimes supernovae get eaten by gigantic space monsters and we can’t see them period (paraphrasing Jayna’s words here)

15/01/2025 3:15

we are moving to Tampere, one of the Koronis asteroids. we tried a new supernova target but the moon was working against us as per usual. i tried to turn Jensen back to the dark side, that is theory, but to no avail. the attempts will continue though :sneaky:

sprinkled between running in to make sure everything was running all well, there was conversation about things one could do over a gap year. it seems reasonable to do something related to one’s field or just go out into the woods and become a park ranger.

14/01/2025 3:53

we lost Jensen. Kales and Matthew are also gone because according to Kales, “it is just not as fun without Jensen.” Prajna has officially “lost it.” i have been working on one of my last remaining graduate school applications.

15/01/2025 4:36

humidity went up from 0.9% to 7% (which is not a problem at all, but still a jump) and wind speed went up to 31 km/hr, which could be a problem if it keeps rising. the telescope closes at wind speeds around 45 km/hr, which happened yesterday. fingers crossed.

15/01/2025 5:43

everything is going quietly and well at the telescope. i am heading back now, but the drivers will stay until about 7 when they will close up the telescope and return. more updates when i wake up!

15/01/2025 17:24 

i woke up around 12:30 to the distance sounds of Prajna in pain. some context for this is that some team had discovered supernovae the Monday before we started observing (which was on Thursday). but when Prajna and Jayna analyzed the data they had obtained, there was simply nothing there. it was as though it had completely disappeared. upon inspection, Prajna found that the telescope that first made the observation specializes, among other things, in looking for very short-lived transients that last less than a day. eventually, they decided to email the team that first made the observation and this morning, they got a response. it turns out, it was an asteroid…

the observations were taken very close together and so they failed to see the asteroid move. tragic.

after this, people slowly began to leave for lunch which is 1:30-2:30. i stayed back and ate stuff at home and then headed over for the daily meeting.

in the daily meeting—usually after lunch to make sure people on observing duty can sleep a bit—we go over how observing went the previous night, talk about project updates and the observing plan for the next night. it seems that we will be losing some observing nights to bad weather next week which is deeply tragic.

after meeting, we continued to work in the conference room for a while. i was working on reducing data to get light curves of Alinda, a near-Earth asteroid which made its closest approach to the Earth just before camp started. since it moves very fast, we have to move the telescope about every half hour/hour to make sure it is always in the field of view. so it is taking me forever to get data reduced from each of these chunks from the first night. 6/7 done though, wahoo!

i came back 5 to update this post, etc. but the data processing will continue. tonight, we are observing on the Carlos Sánchez telescope, the 1.5m telescope. the fun thing about this telescope is that you have to manually open the petals that cover the mirror, so most of us will be heading over to see that around 6!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sad-dinner-800x1067.jpg

2024 in Review,Uzay G. '26,0,2025-01-13T00:00:00-05:00,"This was one of the years of all time. I learned a lot, less about science than usual but more about relationships and who I am. It was a bit painful at times, but there were also many great things.

I caught glimpses of some beautiful ideas, I settled into my life at MIT and now have a circle of people who inspire me and illuminate my life, and I feel more confident to face the world, knowing my strengths and weaknesses a bit better. I also did a lot of collaborative work and really appreciate that kind of thing much more now!

I tried to do research really hard. I grinded, and developed, but I struggled. I am trying to finish the projects I’ve been doing and put them out this month mostly. Quality research is challenging.

In 2024 I developed strength and self reliance. Obviously it’s normal to depend on others, but this year I saw myself confronted with the fallbacks of depending too much. I learned to be happier on my own, and develop a slightly healthier, more understanding mindset towards the way I end up living my life. This year I have had deep, beautiful friendships that I am beyond grateful for. But in some of these lows, I grappled with a sense that things were off, that there was some true connection right around the corner but always out of grasp. I was bound by expectation, waiting to see and be seen by somene. This expectation weighs on others and destroys your lucidity. Instead I have been trying to, mostly successfully after a while, choose to take in the things that bring color to my life, and nurture them from a place of strength. When you are no longer dependent on someone or something in an existential, unhealthy way, you can more clearly see things as you are. You can recognize both the pain and the beauty of the things you are graced with in your friendships, relationships, etc… and then choose what deserves a place in your life.

I think my sense of beauty is growing more and more. I watched some movies that I really liked this year, and I wrote more poetry. Some images really stuck with me deeply, and I want to keep seeking out these kinds of insane artistic experiences.

I have a much better model of what it means to be a researcher thinking about the questions that I’m interested in. Although it may not seem like it from my outputs, I have a better sense of a real agenda I can pursue that satisfies me intellectually/aesthetically and genuinely matters.

I know that I will keep learning, seeking out art, people and new experiences. I know that I will create the conditions for my goals wherever I am, and I know that the world will change faster and faster. I feel okay about all of this, and am excited by everything that lies ahead.

I am in a bit of a corny mood tonight, so I want to leave one message to that person looking back, and it is this: go find the magic. Drink it down without greed, but don’t forget its slow passage. If your mindset goes sour remember there is so much beauty to grasp always. In the famous words of Baudelaire, re-enacted here by Serge Reggiani:


Il faut être toujours ivre, tout est là ; c’est l’unique question. Pour ne pas sentir l’horrible fardeau du temps qui brise vos épaules et vous penche vers la terre, il faut vous enivrer sans trêve. Mais de quoi? De vin, de poésie, ou de vertu à votre guise, mais enivrez-vous! Et si quelquefois, sur les marches d’un palais, sur l’herbe verte d’un fossé, vous vous réveillez, l’ivresse déjà diminuée ou disparue, demandez au vent, à la vague, à l’étoile, à l’oiseau, à l’horloge; à tout ce qui fuit, à tout ce qui gémit, à tout ce qui roule, à tout ce qui chante, à tout ce qui parle, demandez quelle heure il est. Et le vent, la vague, l’étoile, l’oiseau, l’horloge, vous répondront, il est l’heure de s’enivrer ; pour ne pas être les esclaves martyrisés du temps, enivrez-vous, enivrez-vous sans cesse de vin, de poésie, de vertu, à votre guise.

How is it that I get to live every day and see all this magic? that I can learn more about the structure of this world? That I get to think about the unbelievable beauty day after day crystallized in the slow motion of particles, in shapes mapping in and out of each other or the practice of poetry, and this web of rich inner lives illuminating each other? that I love these people and their personable, similar and yet alien outlooks bouncing off against mine? that I get to feel understood and seen, that you understand a view on who I am and choose to walk it through day after day? how is that I get to experience these lives singing against mine for as long as we choose to? and that even after that, I will get to collect these sweet postcards on the road that have made me this single person, lost in immensity, writing it all down?

And so, read this as a catalogue of magic; of passion blooming out and in; of dreams being workshopped; I learned a cool phrase just now, kangai muryō – I am overwhelmed by the beauty of things, and I will stay overwhelmed. Will you come along with me?

Research

[… this section is to be improved, probably as a separate post because of how much attention it deserves]

I don’t want to get into the weeds here just yet, but this is probably where most of my learning has gone.

I’ve been working on a few projects:

- In the Isola lab I’ve been trying to investigate certain claims, for example by Von Oswald et al that inner optimization and gradient descent style dynamics underpin a lot of in context learning in transformers in particular how do they hold up on real data? this work has been super interesting conceptually and I’ve also gotten my hands dirty with a bunch of empirical analysis of real models it’s crispened a bunch of intuitions on how in context happens, but I need to push through a bit to get to the finish line If I do this well I think it might inform how people think about these sorts of in context optimization claims in the real world, along with potential new ways of analyzing how in-context information is used by a model

- If I do this well I think it might inform how people think about these sorts of in context optimization claims in the real world, along with potential new ways of analyzing how in-context information is used by a model

- with Kaivu we’ve been investigating using interpretability methods to understand/create a phenomenology of adversarial attacks, for example extending Aleksander Madry’s work we struggled for a while to get solid vision SAEs we then moved on to language, and get solid results on the mechanistic emergence of features from optimized, OOD inputs submitted this to NeurIPS workshops, got in and went together :P!

- submitted this to NeurIPS workshops, got in and went together :P!

- now Kaivu, Atticus and I are thinking a bit about explicit world modeling and human-model collaboration for science more on this coming soon!


- more on this coming soon!

- with Tanishq and others I’ve been working on a project related to strange effects of data diversity and task interference we submitted some work to ICLR which we are now reworking, more coming


- we submitted some work to ICLR which we are now reworking, more coming

I don’t want to post too much about the future but there are a lot of ideas I’m excited about here. I will also post something about the papers that have stood to me so far. Excited to keep hopping along this research journey.

I’m converging a bit on the type of work/setting I will want to work in long term. I am strongly considering applying to graduate school, and I want a lot of independence. I believe at some point I will pivot to some sort of research startup, where a set of friends and I with a few takes and ideas try to make something happen, in ML. Already currently starting to do things along this vein.

- Quantum II – 8.05 I learned quantum mechanics in 2024! It’s really interesting, and the content was very well presented in this class intense though I was inspired by the scientific ingenuity in the development of quantum mechanics. It was also pretty to see the algebra I know show up so neatly in QM I have loved and continue to love the physicist approach; the quick intuitive arguments; the fact you can formally ground arguments but also just see them right away in your mind’s eye by thinking about physical reality

Secure Hardware Design – 6.5950 very fun I like the hacker mindset because breaking things, especially secure things, makes you focus on really understanding something through and through. You need to explore every angle and get a deep understanding of the way the components interact. Now, in many fields you need to learn something deeply, but often especially in school you don’t have real feedback loops on your learning, or at least feedback loops that aren’t artificial like exams. This makes your understanding more brittle, whereas when you try to break something you explore every facet, and breaking it adequately becomes the feedback loop for your learning. This mindset of turning things into a game extends to many different things. Even in math, you often read about how great mathematicians have the skill of playing with mathematical objects and examples, breaking them down, seeing where things fail and where they work, to develop a good perspective of the field. I think it’s pretty key, but in cybersecurity it’s baked in.


Secure Hardware Design – 6.5950

- very fun

- I like the hacker mindset because breaking things, especially secure things, makes you focus on really understanding something through and through. You need to explore every angle and get a deep understanding of the way the components interact. Now, in many fields you need to learn something deeply, but often especially in school you don’t have real feedback loops on your learning, or at least feedback loops that aren’t artificial like exams. This makes your understanding more brittle, whereas when you try to break something you explore every facet, and breaking it adequately becomes the feedback loop for your learning.

Writing

What I wrote

Not much! Lots of journaling/independent stuff but not much I wanted to post.

I did a lot of writing for my classes, as I mentioned before, in poetry and essays, which I want to catch up to and put out there. My 3 public posts are here, mostly life updates and some thoughts.

I wrote papers! LOL

And some technical writing. I’ve gotten less and less public, for better or worse, partially also as I’ve felt that the standards I want to have increase, and my slack decreases.

What I wanted to write

- a primer on abstract algebra Nope


- Nope

- philosophy poasting Nope


- Nope

- more poetry !


- !

- technical posts that link ideas across subjects AI and TCS? Nope


- AI and TCS? Nope


- Nope

- thoughts on rationality

What I want to write

I want to publish and finish some of the thoughts from this year, notably:

- essay on cultural differences between the France-US, what heroes say about culture, and the process vs the outcome and where I fit in with all of this


- and where I fit in with all of this

- list impactful papers; research ideas

- distill my research aesthetic

- write down some research lessons from the past year

- write down some pieces on powerful media I’ve been consuming eg taste of cherry, Dostoevsky


- eg taste of cherry, Dostoevsky

Content I liked

Note: shifting style of this post from enumerative to still enumerative, but for the things that actually stood out, not complete.

craze,Kanokwan T. '26,2,2025-01-13T00:00:00-05:00,"every blog I’ve ever blogged

has come directly out of frenzy

it’s not a slow, methodological process

 

against my will,

inspiration strikes

and fast

 

and it feels like the blog manifests itself through me

as if it, itself, wants to get out into the world

and I am simply only a vessel

 

and the worst part is,

it happens all the time

I randomly get the urge to make something

it feels like I black out—

there is nothing else in the world I can do

I am barely conscious

and time does not pass

—then I wake up with the thing already made

 

I have more than 100 blog ideas

saved in a nifty spreadsheet

and only when the inspiration threshold hits

and my sweet little creativity gremlin takes over

do any of those ideas make it out

 

all creative pursuits feel like this to me

 

it’s kinda funny

being at the whims of ideas

 

in another life,

I could have been a painter

(I love to use paint as a base for mixed media things)

or a new media artist

(I constantly have ideas for immersive art installations)

or an actress

(I used to take acting classes through a talent agency and technically acted in Speech & Debate in high school and I just adore acting as a craft)

or a poet

(I used to perform at poetry slams)

or a food critic

(I sometimes describe my cuisine experience to whoever is out for a meal with me in deep detail, and have been told I’d make a good Anton Ego)

or maybe those are just further down the line

it can be a long life

 

I don’t know

I’m just inclined to do creative things

and I know having creative power is something I value

in whatever things

I decide to do

 

I’ve been creating a lot, recently

away from the noise of work

the bustle of the school

breaks help

 

I’ve been watercoloring—

abstract collages

portraits of people

landscapes

—whatever comes to mind

 

I’ve been journalling, as I have been for years

I’ve written letters: some I’ve delivered, some I’ll never send

I’ve practiced my cursive—the letter z is so weird

 

I’m blogging right now

I didn’t plan to blog tonight

not at all

it’s late

1:07am, where I’m at (Armenia! to teach renewable energy and circuitry and stuff)

a terribly inconvenient hour

for a morning bird like me

but it is what it is

 

hmmmm

 

there’s so much I want to tell you

so much

about my 3 years at the institute

what it felt like leading up to my time here

what I see beyond

and all the small—perhaps more important—moments in between

 

this is so weird

have I ever said that? I don’t think I have

blogging feels like…

yelling into the void

drafting in a spiral notebook

speaking before a stage of thousands

whispering to myself

chatting with a friend

…all at once

most like the last experience, if anything

 

because

talking with myself, all alone

talking with a stranger

talking with anyone—just as a baseline

i treat as talking with

a friend

 

yeah

friend

 

anyways

I should rest

instead of binging Portrait of a Lady on Fire and Wicked and V for Vendetta analysis clips

"books I read in 2024, ranked",Kai V. '25,6,2025-01-13T00:00:00-05:00,"This year I read 20 books. Here they are in a tier list, ranked based on personal enjoyment/emotional impact and not at all on literary merit or perceived quality, because:

1) I don’t trust myself to make a competent assessment along that axis—eg Ocean Vuong’s poetry collection would probably be higher if I felt capable of Actually Understanding Poetry, but I want to avoid arbitrarily ranking critically acclaimed books higher based on some aspect I don’t feel like I understood.

2) I think you only care about the enjoyment/impact axis if you’re reading this, like you can just scroll a Harvard Great Books class syllabus or something if you want a books-by-literary-merit list.



Here’s how you should interpret the letters, and a list of all the books.

Originally I was going to write something about every single book on the list but now I realize that I am lazy. However, I feel really strongly about my S tier books so I’ll say something about each of them.

The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro

This is my favorite book I have ever read—for its emotional impact on me, but also for expanding what I thought you could do with literature. I’m in love with the way Ishiguro approaches characterization through unreliable narration. I often hear “unreliable narrator” used to refer to an agent with ulterior motives who purposely obscures information from the reader. But that’s not how I’m using the term—instead Ishiguro evokes an unsettling feeling that something is wrong, that the narrator’s own model of their world is precarious, even if the narrator seems largely sane and competent. The details the narrator relays tell you how history shaped them. The details the narrator doesn’t relay tell you about their psyche, the nature of their denial, the gaping hole that the reader is forced to reckon with and fill in on their own.

Even in Ishiguro novels that I’m less fond of (Klara and the Sun was mid; When We Were Orphans was mildly incoherent), this characterization is always skillfully done. But nowhere is it done better than The Remains of the Day. A butler past the prime of his career takes a tour through England and reminisces on his days serving his former lord. There are maybe two sentences in the novel in which he directly addresses the feeling that we might expect from someone in his circumstances. Everything else has to be inferred. Yet the subtle pressures the story applies to us shape the inferred conclusion so sharply and clearly that the result is far more heartbreaking than any explicit admission of emotion could be.

It seems like Ishiguro doesn’t hit hard for everyone, but I’d still say this novel is my highest recommendation.

Fun Home by Alison Bechdel

I read the first chapter of Fun Home at the start of my junior year of high school. It was part of an anthology assigned in English class. That single chapter left such a deep impression on me that, five years later, when I happened to pick up this book from a store shelf and leaf through it, I recognized it immediately—despite having long forgotten the author and title—based on what I can only describe as the rhythm of the writing, and finished it standing right there at the shelf for two hours.

Fun Home is a graphic novel about Bechdel’s childhood, focusing in particular on her tenuous relationship with her closeted father and her own realization that she was gay. Most of my sense of literary aesthetic (as in, my sense of whether a piece of writing is beautiful or not) is derived from that first chapter, which accomplished its task so completely and perfectly that it convinced me forever of the power of a well-crafted personal essay. It’s not an exaggeration to say that if I hadn’t read that, I likely wouldn’t be writing blogs now. I don’t know if I just reread it that many times when I encountered it in high school, or if it struck a deep, already-existing chord, calling to the surface a sense of pacing and beauty—on the sentence level and on the essay level—that already existed inside me.

Its graphic novel nature enables each page to tell multiple sub-stories at once as parallel threads which sometimes intersect. There’s current-Alison’s train of thought, in full sentences. Past-Alison’s perception of the story, in dialogue and illustration, which also work to frame current-Alison’s thoughts, and all the parallels between her and her father, set up as camera angles and matching silhouettes. It’s really impressive if you read the actual book. Bechdel generally achieves a smooth, cohesive stream of thought from the beginning to the end of a chapter, in which three or four threads are set up when the chapter begins and interact through dialogue, illustration, literary allusion, and caption until the end. It’s done very precisely and elegantly.

Intermezzo by Sally Rooney

This was by far my most surprising read of the year! I’ve tried Rooney before but have always found that I cannot stand her writing. Normal People is one of the few books in the world that frustrated me so much that I just stopped reading it. (I think it’s the only book I’ve ever given one star on Goodreads lol.) After Intermezzo, I’ll probably give her other novels a more serious chance again.

Here were my two problems with Normal People:

1) I find it really frustrating when the central conflict of a story could easily be resolved by clear communication, especially when we’re meant to believe that the characters are Deep, Thoughtful, Kind People. I’m told this is just how things turn out sometimes in real life, but it doesn’t make for an engaging story. Maybe I’ll relate to this kind of thing one day when I’m inexplicably in love with someone I don’t know how to talk to?? What??

2) Rooney’s writing style is usually quite dry? She describes the chain of events as it’s happening, using the exact same tone across all situations. She omits quotation marks as a stylistic choice, merging the character’s experience of reality with their own stream of consciousness. I mean, I get it. I also hate it.

These two aspects of her writing unfortunately totally prevented me from appreciating the deep understanding of human relationships that each rave NYT review claimed her novels captured. Happily, neither was a problem for me in Intermezzo.

Intermezzo follows two brothers, a decade apart in age, navigating their very different spheres of life after the death of their father. Because the story is written by Sally Rooney this entails some complicated romantic entanglements. I felt that the conflicts here were true and that the characters tried their best to communicate with each other honestly—and when a misunderstanding occurred it was for a real, substantive reason (which—yes—can be human weakness: fear, cowardice, pride), as opposed to feeling contrived for the sake of having a conflict.

The writing style might have been my favorite aspect of the novel. The novel hops between the perspectives of Ivan, the younger brother; Peter, the older brother; and Margaret, one of the women involved. Rooney employs a distinct tone for each of them which feels pretty far from her impersonal dry style in previous stories, and because it feels so much like we’re actually listening to the thoughts of the characters, the omission of quotation marks works to merge the current character’s experience of reality into their stream of consciousness. (This is maybe the first book I’ve said this about?)

I think, also, that characterization can easily feel stilted or awkward. An author tries to shove too much into one character. Different bits don’t make sense together. Or, in fear of this, the author shrinks back from too much explicit characterization altogether. Intermezzo does a good job of striking a difficult balance here: Peter and Ivan felt very true.

Looking back rationally on the story, I think Peter’s ending was a little bit contrived, and I loved Margaret’s chapters but think the book would have been more cohesive without her external perspective, with more space to develop the brothers. At its core it’s about the relationship between Peter and Ivan, and I get that Margaret was supposed to deliver some reasoned external perspective, but I wish there was a version where we only perceive the brothers through each other’s eyes.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tier.png,1
reviewing MIT’s Intro To Deep Learning,Aiden H. '28,4,2025-01-12T00:00:00-05:00,"This past week was the first week of 
        IAP.
      
 Along with a 
        UROP,
      
 I took Intro to Deep Learning (or 6.S191, which no one calls it), an annual class taught by two former MIT students turned power couple, Alexander and Ava Amini.

Since the class started, it has kind of blown up due to all of the lectures and labs being open-sourced on the website and Youtube, with this Obama deepfake specifically making the rounds in 2020.

Given the opportunity to take such a famed class, I decided to give my 
        unabashed
      
 thoughts.

Lectures

The class ran from Monday to Friday with a scheduled 1:00-4:00 P.M. lecture time. Each day was scheduled for “two” lectures, one given by Alexander and one given by Ava. Typically they lasted only a little over an hour each, meaning I ended up leaving around 3:15 each day while the remaining lecture time was used as office hours with the TA’s.

Having no prior knowledge of deep learning except that one 3Blue1Brown video, I found the lectures relatively straightforward in terms of how they explained the foundational architecture around different deep learning networks. Since there was extra time everyday, the lecturers were also very open 
        to answering lots of questions,
      
 even in a lecture hall of like 250. Still, the length of pure lecture on completely new, high-level material felt pretty draining. Because Alexander and Ava are high-up industry professionals who probably can’t take more than a week off of work, I understand the pressed schedule. From a purely logistical standpoint, I think two weeks with more time to digest and review material would have solidified my understanding more. For example, they went over CNNs, VAEs, and GANs in one day, and of course by the next morning I couldn’t articulate to you the differences with each because we went straight into types of reinforcement learning.

Additionally, I understand why with such a short timeframe and an attempt to be open-sourced to as many people as possible that the lectures were purely theoretical, but I kind of needed and wanted the mathematical basis behind a lot of these structures. To say they skimmed over the most important math would be false–the first lectures were leaned heavily on matrix operations, propagation with non-linearities, the loss function and gradient descent, etc.–but once applied to different structures, I felt loss on exactly what was happening between layers or even across structures. How did each differ mathematically? Is there a way to view vector and matrix values at each point in a deep neural network? Again, as I don’t know much about deep learning, I don’t know if this a niche thing to call out or an important topic skimmed over, but for an MIT crowd, I want to see the numbers move! Maybe they didn’t want to assume that much linear algebra knowledge though.

After three days of intro lectures, Thursday and Friday has class sponsors come give guest lectures on a variety of topics to give more specifics on industry-specific applications. I found these to be very hit or miss with how informative they actually were. Ava gave the last guest lecture on deep learning for biology (which duh was my favorite), but because I personally am only interested in that topic compared to something like LLMs, I got pretty bored by other lectures no matter how engaging and passionate a presenter they are. For students who genuinely come into the class without any knowledge of deep learning (which is becoming increasingly less likely), the variety of these guest lectures could help inform how they want to enter the field. For students or industry professionals who have already chosen a sector, these were less helpful, since tactical knowledge > inspiration.

Nonetheless, there is something really important to say about both Alexander and Ava’s ability to teach these topics to such a broad audience (in person and online) and also their desire to apply them to the modernizing deep learning landscape. Although I don’t know how different this year was compared to previous ones, they made sure to focus on how everything can be applied to the rise of now-widespread tech like LLMs/chatbots or self-driving cars that exploded in recent years.

 

Software Labs

In tandem with the first three lectures, there were three online coding “labs” that walk through some of the basics of deep learning implementation. The labs themselves were pretty straightforward, not requiring students to write the code for an entire model but instead only fill in some lines of code here and there, but they had pretty cool implementations (a song generator, a face debiasing system, and a chatbot that speaks like Yoda). The labs were not required to pass the class, but completing them and uploading them along with a written explanation of what you did allowed you to enter into a contest for a prize (headphones, a desktop monitor, and a Kindle, respectively).

Starting with the pros, the labs each had very interesting applications that definitely helped distract from the fairly monotonous complexity that learning abstract computer science in a lecture style has. Also not having them all be required took some weight off of the beginning of the week, allowing me to choose which labs I was more interested in completing, considering each one took at least an hour to complete and hours more to hone for competition’s sake.

Now for the rant. I would say that the access to labs of this quality is definitely something to be grateful for, also considering they are open-sourced for millions. But the quality of the work derived from the labs was not worth the amount of time spent on them. Although unrealistic for beginner level engineers to create their own models, a majority of the labs were spent in 
        Google Colab
      
 just importing things I’ve never heard of and running patches of code that were vaguely explained but that I couldn’t possibly begin to create on my own. Also when trying to better my code, I quickly ran into the free GPU limit on Colab so I ended up having to redo it all on separate Google accounts (which on Colab means rerunning every cell, some of which took like 30 minutes because, yk, training takes a while). A similar issue occurred when using the external sites for APIs and exports they had recommended because they were created by the course sponsors/guest lecturers (all of which is nice, but highkey weren’t that user friendly or reliable softwares). Finally, one of the cells of code that was prewritten straight up didn’t work and 
        I
      
 tried to fix it but because I didn’t have access to the dictionary they were using (because it was imported), so I didn’t even know where to start.

On lab 3 (training an LLM to speak like Yoda), I tried for like 6+ hours over multiple days to try and create the best model in order to win the contest, but I kept giving up because factors beyond my control kept limiting what I could do and made the process very laborious (see: I ran out of GPU so I switched accounts which meant running the hour of code again only to notice my free API key had expired so I had to do it again the next morning but Colab sucks and actually didn’t save right etc. etc. etc.). In the end I didn’t even have a final product.

Nonetheless, all of my bitching and moaning can’t be taken as too serious of a negative, because as stated before, none of this was technically required, it just did give me a bit of hassle.

 

Final Presentation

For MIT students taking the class for credit, there were two options for a final project to be submitted by Friday’s lecture: a one-pager reviewing a deep learning paper (boring!) or a 5 minute group presentation on a deep learning proposal to be given at the end of Friday’s lecture (definitely less boring!). Doing the proposal also put MIT-based teams up for the “grand prizes” of Apple Watches, desktop monitors, and a 
        NVIDIA 4070 GPU.
      


I worked with some other 
        course 6-7
      
 freshman friends on an application that we all had general UROP experience with the night before it was due, and imo 
        we cranked out a pretty good project.
      
 Tragically the night before presentations at midnight, the course staff announced that because so many people opted to present over the paper, presentations had to be cut from 5 minutes to 3 minutes. **cue major panic**

After the final two guest lectures on Friday, we got to sit and listen to everyone’s final project proposals, which was pretty interesting considering people taking the class ranged from MIT freshman to students at other universities who travelled for the class to literal business professionals with like master’s degrees who took off work to take this for fun. Ngl though, having to listen to two hours of presentations after two hours of lecture was verrrry draining and I was verrrry over it in the end. You could also definitely tell that most presentations were cut short or glossed over because of the time though, but also I understand why we couldn’t all stay there until 8:00 P.M. listening to projects. They even brought out a mini gong to ring (hit? strike? play?) when your team’s time was up (even though a lot of people kept talking anyway!!!!!!!), which was hilarious.

In the end my team didn’t place top 3, but 
        that’s okay
      
 because there were a ton of cool and unique projects. You can see all final presentation slides here (…I was in group 6)!

 

How much I learned: 8/10

Difficulty/homework: 6/10

Pacing: 4/10

How much free stuff I got: 6/10 (I got one shirt, but 
        that’s definitely above average for a class)
      


Overall: 6/10 – a slightly above average class

9/8/2025

Dear blog,

Last night, I arrived to Figueres by train around 9:30. With two suitcases in tow— taking full advantage of of United Airline’s weight limit— it was the perfect day for all of the escalators in Catalonia to be down. Certainly— I decided as I rode from one crowded platform to the next— the amount of times I had dropped my luggage in the past hour was enough embarrassment for all of 2025.

Not 30 minutes later, I found myself stuck (yes, stuck.) in the bathroom. Despite all my best efforts, I couldn’t get the lock to turn. My host family was sweetly setting the table for a proper Spanish meal when they received the Whatsapp message- “Sorry to bother, but I think I may be trapped in the upstairs restroom.”

Suddenly, I heard a storm of footsteps up the stairs and a flurry of multilingual exclamations: pon tu pie aquí – did you turn the lock the right away? – tienes que empujar muy duro – Are you okay?

After we came to the mutual realization that there was absolutely no way I was unjamming the door on my own, my host brother climbed up through the shower window and came to the rescue. Freedom at last!

So you could definitely say that my first dinner in Spain began with great icebreaker material.

Although school
 started today— much to the dismay of my younger host sister— I had the day off to adjust to the jet lag. The brother, my age and still a few days shy from returning to his college in the US, was also free and thus tasked with giving me a tour of Figueres and the surrounding towns.

Between winding mountain roads, walks along the beach, a stop for lunch, and lots of practice in Spanish conversation, I soon gathered the common theme of the area. My corner of Catalonia thrived off of summer tourism from France, and I had found myself in the off season. Each destination I was shown was quickly qualified by the fact that, had I arrived in the summer, the place would look complete different: shop doors wide open, traffic stretching for miles, and tourists in every corner.

I don’t think I really mind it though. As much as I had lamented not being among most of my program members in Barcelona, I find myself in need of my own off season as well. For much of the last semester, my brain has felt stuffed and crowded and foggy, using all its efforts to maintain the same academic routine. Each time my friends and I discuss my first true brush with small town living, the recurring bit I’ve landed on is that, at the very least, I’ll find inner peace.

While this may be an exaggeration, taking myself out of my comfort zone often gifts me with a clearer vision of who I am at the present day. Away from home, the people I meet have no recollection of the version of me that was mortifyingly shy for most of my childhood— ”that’s odd, you don’t strike me as the very quiet type.” Here, when they offer me tomato salad at dinner, they have no idea that I’ve picked tomatoes off of everything I’ve eaten since I was little. Surrounded by people completely unaware of my predispositions, I learned that I actually enjoy them now. What a lovely idea— that each time I introduce myself to someone new, I get the opportunity to meet myself again.

I know this is a lot of big talk for someone who has barely spent 24 hours here, but I saw the same thing happen to me when I traveled alone to Boston for 
        CPW,
      
, and when I spent my 
        IAP
      
 in Sao Paolo
 last year. It’s why I’ll always be a big advocate for programs like 
        MISTI,
      
 or just independent travel in general.

Anyways, it’s getting late and I have to teach tomorrow (after I watch just one more episode of Money Heist). Perhaps I’ll write you again after I’ve gotten the chance to do some work with the school, or maybe even after my weekend trip to Barcelona. Whether that happens or not, thanks for reading, and I hope you’re doing well.

Sincerely,

Veronica",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2589-400x225.jpg,1

(Not) Home for the Holidays,Allison E. '27,1,2025-01-03T00:00:00-05:00,"I’ve been home for winter break since last Sunday, and it’s been a flurry of many things, but second most importantly, it’s been a flurry of FOOD!! 

In honor of holiday meals at home, I want to share a holiday meal away from home. Aka, it’s finally time to post my (extremely belated) Thanksgiving saga!


        It is Thursday, November 28th.
      
 Or, well, 
        it will be when I post this (hopefully).
      
 Another year, another Thanksgiving cooking post!

Sophomore fall has been busy for my friends & I, which has meant no more 12-person feasts on random weekends in the middle of the semester (very PNR-core). But! This Thanksgiving, most of us are on campus, so we’ve decided to remedy that in as overzealous a fashion as possible. I’m documenting this attempt 
        in real time
      
, so today’s blog post is like Maxwell’s equations: it comes to you in 4 parts.

Part 1: The menu

I write from ye olden days of Tuesday, November 26th. Our spirit is indomitable, and our ambition knows no bounds. After 251 messages, 4 in-person scheming sessions, and a very chaotic spreadsheet, we’ve arrived at a (prospective) menu:



Is it cohesive? Nope. Do we care? Also nope.

As a food traditionalist, I insisted on some of the classic American Thanksgiving dishes–turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce. However, as someone who doesn’t actually like those foods that much (oops 🫣), I’m very happy that the rest of our repertoire is… not classic American LOL. Also, yes, the turkey will be precooked, and very small. We’re not ready to spend 8 hours screwing up a $40 turkey when most people don’t like turkey anyways 😭

Part 2: The shopping

It’s now Wednesday, November 27th, and we’ve finally finished gathering the ingredients… ‘Twas a long and arduous journey, tracing three corners of Boston, six grocery stores, an Uber grocery delivery and 11 man-hours. Nevertheless, we did it!

By the day before Thanksgiving, most of campus has already gone home, and classes are half-empty or cancelled. Nevertheless, work never ceases, and our grocery run didn’t begin until 5:00 pm. However, because our menu is an odd combination of traditional American Thanksgiving, various Asian cuisines, and a Hungarian cake, we had to hit several locations–Whole Foods for the pre-cooked turkey, 
        H Mart
      
 for the Asian ingredients, 
        Star Market
      
 for the niche ingredients, and Trader Joe’s for the cheapest prices. 



Our crew of four shoppers split in two, with Arthur L. ‘27 and Benson L. ‘27 headed to H Mart and Miranda Z. ‘27 and I headed to Star Market. Miranda and I took the 1 Bus across the Charles River and stopped by a small Trader Joe’s along the way, just to gauge prices before actually buying things. Then we roamed the aisles of the gloriously large Star Market, searching for anything discounted.

After a moderately successful haul, we Ubered back to our dorm (yes, we’re lazy smh) to meet Arthur & Benson and shove our acquisitions in the fridge. Then, Benson and I set off for the final leg of the journey: Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.

The walk from Burton-Conner to Trader Joe’s is 25 minutes, but there’s a 
        Bluebikes station
      
 nearby and a nice bike lane heading straight there, so it’s only around 15 minutes! We rode the Bluebikes to Trader Joe’s and then walked to Whole Foods to pick up our turkey–which, apparently, was NOT small AT ALL. Oh well, not complaining!

Finally, one last stop for the rest of the grocery shopping–Trader Joe’s part 2–the much larger and better stocked Cambridge-side version.

SIKE!

This Trader Joe’s had NO EGGS. As in, none to speak of whatsoever. 
        Not even $10 organic free range non-GMO grass fed calculus-proficient eggs 😭.
      
 We also couldn’t find cocoa powder or heavy whipping cream, both of which Trader Joe’s consistently has. It was 8:30 pm. We still hadn’t eaten dinner. Everywhere was closing soon. *Panic*

This is where, as much as I hate to admit it, Uber delivery came to save the day… Armed with a handy 40% coupon, we put in an order for all the missing ingredients and headed back to Burton-Conner. Mission complete!!

Of course, this success meant a celebration was in order–next stop, dinner in Chinatown! 

dim sum… yumm

Andddd then we Ubered back to campus, right? nOpE, it’s time for late night walks through Boston!!

… 2 hours, 3 playgrounds, and many shenanigans later …

Ok, finally sleep time. See y’all tomorrow!

Part 3: The cooking

Thanksgiving day has arrived–let the cooking begin!

SIKE AGAIN! The Uber grocery delivery did NOT include heavy whipping cream. Despite charging us for an even larger carton than we’d requested. So… off went Benson to Whole Foods (closed), CVS (no whipping cream), and Hmart (no whipping cream). Lesson learned–no last minute Thanksgiving shopping 😭. He ended up grabbing coconut milk as a substitute.

Nevertheless, we persevered. There were 16 dishes to cook, and 11 people to feed. Luckily, Csilla F. ‘27 lives in a large suite, and her suitemates were gone for the weekend, so we set up shop there (thank you Csillaaa). After stealing borrowing some extra tables, chairs, and cooking equipment from… locations, we set to work.

This isn’t our first rodeo, and by now we’ve mastered the art of parallelized cooking–there’s always a task for everyone, regardless of skill (which I don’t have much of). Chopping cucumbers, mashing potatoes, buttering corn, and most importantly, washing the neverending stream of dirty dishes!!

Finally finally finally, after 
        6+ hours of cooking,
      
 the feast was complete!! The final menu (slightly modified from the original) included turkey, braised pork, fried chicken, pork ribs, carbonara, mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh bread, corn on the cob, chinese cucumber salad, korean-style yu choy, gravy, apple pie, tres leches cake, coconut milk cake, and striped biscuits. pHew…

Part 4: The aftermath

By the time dinner was finished, it was only 9:00 pm, and the night was still young! It was time for… a rager? Nope, time for an infernally difficult 1,000 piece puzzle !!!! Accompanied by at least 10 renditions of the song “APT.”, a bunch of silly dancing, and 
        many shenanigans,
      
 of course.

And then it was 2:00 am, and the puzzle wasn’t done. It didn’t help that the pieces are all funky, and we refused to look at the picture. And then it was 3:00 am, and the puzzle wasn’t done. And then it was 4:00 am. And then… FINALLY, at 5:00 am on the dot (I have timestamps), we put the last piece into the puzzle, and Thanksgiving was officially over!

this thing is actually evil

We might not have been home for Thanksgiving, but we made a little piece of it for ourselves in Boston. Happy holidays y’all!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241224_181131-1-800x609.jpg

letter to my 2023 self,Janet G. '27,0,2025-01-02T00:00:00-05:00,"I write two letters to myself at 
         the end of every year. 
      
 I write one to my future self who has experienced the upcoming year, and I write a response letter to my past self. I post the response letters publicly, and this year since I no longer have Instagram I thought I’d post it here

Dear 2023 Janet,

I’m responding to you from Toronto. That’s right — you’ll be relieved to hear that I’m actually travelling now, in contrast to last year’s misfortune. That’s a story that ends in two crutches, a sprained ankle, and a photo of us being shopping-carted to our 5.111 final.

haylea b. ’27 pushing me to our 5.111 final, with our TA looking very confused. not sure if the entertainment was worth me being stuck immobile for 2 weeks, but i digress

I took advantage of our mobility this year: 
        Nicole 
      
visited me from Cambridge, and we wandered around Boston and 
        somehow managed to not freeze to death.
      
 We took the wrong train but arrived in New York after some adventure, and now I’m in Toronto enjoying the exchange rate and the best hotpot I’ve ever had.

this was SO YUMMY peak food experience. it’s souper hotpot in toronto!

You wrote in your reflection last year that you grew a lot. You were an unrooted seedling who let the Pacific winds carry you over the oceans, through Auckland and Christchurch and Wellington and San Francisco, and 
        plant you in Boston.
      
 You went on 
        so many adventures,
      
 lived a crazy year, and relished the freedom that adulthood brought you.

It was a lot of fun and serendipity and fast-paced-ness and wild stories we’ll tell for years to come. What you didn’t say in the letter was that you were tired. Everyone was right: pushing a 
        ‘Senior Summer’
      
 and PNR semester to the utmost was an experience you did not regret. Still, it was a bit too much. You told me that you wanted to change.

Taking root and settling down is hard. There are little habits and New Year’s Resolutions you can promise yourself, but reality moves beyond happy-Instagram-snapshot-endings. We received a herb-growing kit as a Secret Santa gift last year. You wrote that you could take your experiences growing this cilantro and apply it to care for yourself in the same way, with water, nutrition, and sunlight. But after the new year, half of the herbs didn’t sprout, and the other half eventually died due to your disheartened lack of care. Life mirrors art: during 
        IAP, 
      
 you regressed into terrible sleeping habits and questionable food consumption methods and mentally withered one way or another.

Spring was still hard. Your workload came to a head and ultimately you made the tough choice to drop a club that you really, really cared about. Even before then, you had already dropped the ball twice and disappointed your friends. You’d told me that you wanted to be more academic and rigorous, and failing your first midterm of the semester felt like a slap in the face. You began questioning whether you belonged at this school. I know, I know — you had thought yourself too good to get imposter syndrome, because didn’t you work hard enough to achieve enough in high school to feel like you belonged here? — but only a lucky few have never doubted their place here, and you’re not special. 

Not being special is okay. You grinded out evenings in the 
        Stud
      
 like everyone else, and got an A in that class despite the first midterm. You spent your summer doing research, and you had a great time doing the same thing as all your friends: cooking together, hanging out at libraries, and complaining about your lack of research progress. You learned that you can live more slowly.

Moving slowly means seeing everything in higher resolution. The tails of shooting stars are just streetlights you’re speeding past; biology research was not the noble, groundbreaking adventure you hoped it would be. It’s still worth it, because you still learned a lot both about the practice and yourself. Culturing cells taught you a lot about patience and precision: two weeks may feel like a scary number, but really that’s just the time it takes to thaw another set of cells for new experiments. Changing cell media was one of the most stressful things we ever did, but boy was it satisfying when I saw that my cells are stretched out and lounging in the culture media. There is something noble, groundbreaking, and adventurous about the practice of research. It just might not come in the form that you imagined.

Of course, there’s nothing wrong with the occasional whimsy. You explored Stanford with friends and learned that the higher you go, the better the view gets. You flew to Pittsburgh on two weeks’ notice to see 
        Nicole, 
      
 to talk about perfumes and make bao buns. You went to London and Oxford with 
        Claire 
      
 for a camp, and we had so much fun meeting some of the coolest people ever and eating delicious food. The intensity of experience was similar to last summer, but the density was much more manageable, and you left feeling rejuvenated and content. You found a better balance.

london! pc claire w. ’27

Balance doesn’t mean complete equilibrium. Systems at complete equilibrium have zero energy; in biological terms, they’re dead. Sometimes you’ve got to let things take over your life. HackMIT is the best example of this, and we’ve written about that before. You’ve given your all to more things beyond Hack, and even if some things don’t work out — frankly, most of them didn’t — it’s okay because you learned and you loved and you lived.

I’m a sophomore now. We turned twenty in a surprise-but-not-really party, surrounded by many of the people we love most. You’ll be relieved to hear how a summer away doesn’t really change things. Your friends still remember, and all the little details of love manifest themselves in unexpected ways — 
        the ice cream flavour they (try to) buy for you,
      
 the chef’s knife he heard you raving about, 
        a drawing of the bird you told her was your favorite.
      
 Still, entering a new decade of my life hasn’t flipped a switch of maturity. I’m still fumbling along and making mistakes that I occasionally regret.

I’m also now on the blogs! We applied again and got in. Yes, sometimes if you try again you can get lucky, and applying again was one of the best decisions I made this year. I love the community (yay <3), and I’m honestly glad that we had time to live some life at MIT without putting all of it online, so it all worked out.

Don’t worry, I still remember all the things you wanted to tell the 2022 Janet who obsessively browsed the blogs every other day as a coping mechanism. I’ve attached it below.

Dear 2022 Janet, 

I know that life sucks right now. You’re still tweaking out over the fact that none of your essays feel fully finished and you’re currently hyperfixating on even the punctuation you’re using because you’re worried that the AOs will think you’re stupid or annoying or whatever else. 

It does get better. You will get into the school that you were afraid to admit was your dream. You thought for the longest time that MIT was the one school that was impossible, so you didn’t even decide to apply until the last week of December. You’ve since learned the lesson of giving things a shot anyway, and it paid off. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows — in fact, most of the time the weather is sus and you’re miserable and tired — but you could not imagine a better community to grow in. 

But hey — even if you hadn’t gotten in, things would’ve been okay. The worst moments in your life always occurred the last day before big tests. At this point everything is largely out of your control, but you still have to sprint in those last moments, to try and shift the probability a little more in your favour. The moment you submit those applications, everything will be over, and for the first time in your life you will have closed a significant chapter. 

Uncertainty is scary. You don’t know the future self writing to you, and you’re worried that none of it will work out. That’s out of your hands; trust that the person you’ll become is strong enough to turn around and tell you that you’ll be okay, and she will become that person for you. All you need to do is to push through these last few days and try your best.

Tomorrow your family will ask you to visit a mountain with them. You will hesitate because you feel like you should look over your application one more time and pray that you will get into the schools that you want. You will make the right choice and go with them, because you need to breathe and remember that there is more to life than essays. There are also the winding roads of the New Zealand countryside, the Pōhutukawa in full summer bloom, and the winds turning the windmills in the distance. One day these winds will blow you over the Pacific, to places thousands of miles away, where your family has still never been but supported you to go regardless. In the meantime you will sit shotgun as your dad complains about the poor design decisions of the road, and you will doze off in the lull of the drive. 

spot the windmills in the background (the dimmed colour is because i took this photo through the car window)

We have not been back since. It doesn’t matter, because even if we do visit, we will see the house as a stranger. 2022 Janet, I want you to go to sleep now — it’s 2am when you finish your letter — and wake up tomorrow, and take in as much of the December summer as possible. I want you to grumble a little less when the parentals knock on your door in the morning; I want you to tell them that yes, really, the outing was fun. You were fine with the drive being so long — in fact, you wished it would last a little longer. 

The heart is a sticky thing. Telling yourself that “home is where the heart is” doesn’t always feel helpful; there’s a home in New Zealand, in MIT, in all the friends who you have come to love. It means that you are always simultaneously at home and homesick. I know that a sense of belonging felt impossible when you had to move through so many places so quickly, when it felt like you barely had a chance to take root in one place before moving on. Feeling stuck trying to hold onto so many things at once is not fun.

Seriously, though — it’ll be okay! In 2024, you will learn to savour life. You will take long walks by the river, letting your roots gradually stretch out and capture those cities in your memory. We can hold onto many things beyond cities too: the cacophony of an off-key birthday chorus, the conversations that you marinate on for days, the trace of their face in the moonlight. These moments will stay with you as you live on, and the journey forward will be a little less daunting. 

Love,

2024 Janet","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image3-400x645.png

everything i made this year,Gloria Z. '26,9,2025-01-01T00:00:00-05:00,"Wow I haven’t blogged in one million years! I feel like I’ve written many stubs and snippets over the past few months, but I haven’t been able to push any of them over the finish line, mostly due to lack of time and mental space. In an effort to record at least some of what happened this year, I’m writing this blog, which includes…

First, the things I made this year, including but not limited to textiles, paintings, and posters. As we round out 2024, I wanted to audit my creative output this year, in order to 1) see what actually happened and 2) figure out what I want to focus on making next year. To summarize my thoughts in a sentence, I would say that this was a year of trying new mediums and materials, sometimes at the cost of letting old skills atrophy.

The second part of this blog is about, more abstractly, the decisions I made this year. I feel like many parts of my life began to shift and settle into place, if only on the surface, and I’ve been thinking a lot about my career, work-life balance, creativity, and how different it is to work than to be a student. More on these things further down the blog, though, and we can start first with:

a] the things

1 – a book about conversations and norms

, a design class I took in the spring about translated typography. Modeled after language-learning pamphlets such as “101 Spanish Conversations for Beginners,” it attempts to parody, pick apart, and find comfort in the patterns of everyday conversation. The book includes a set of ten “translated” conversations whose rules, contents, and usage are laid out visually and instructionally; it was assembled from laser-cut and spray-painted chipboard and is meant to be taken apart, overlaid on top of itself, and reassembled by the user.

2 – various quilted items

What the title says! Over IAP, I participated in a 
        blanket quilting workshop
      
, and now I teach weekly quilting workshops in 
        Metropolis
      
.

Over the summer, I also decided to join a local weaving circle back home in California, to learn a new skill and keep myself occupied through the long summer days. What I didn’t expect was that the group was populated entirely by retired grandmothers (though in hindsight… maybe not that surprising). One of the women hosted the circle in her sun-drenched Berkeley backyard, and it was so lovely to soak in the weather, thread bits of yarn through warp and weft, and listen to them catch everyone up each week about their grandchildren, travel plans, and latest weaving projects. I feel like I rarely interact with people in that stage of life, and it was strangely comforting to hear about the mundanities and excitements of their daily lives (and to tell them about mine!).

3 – with my friend Lee, a drawing machine 

I meant to blog about this project right after we “finished” it at the end of January, but then the rush of the semester started and it was just kind of over (plus we didn’t get around to taking nice pictures of it until literally May). Nevertheless, here it is in all its glory – a pen plotter, drawing machine, robot, whatever you want to call it, with 5 degrees of freedom (aka it can move the brush pen it’s holding in the x, y, z, pitch, and yaw axes).

We made this over IAP with the help of a independent project grant! The idea was to make a machine that could replicate and draw calligraphic strokes. However, speedrunning this project in 
        one month
      
 while we both had other things like UROPs going on was not the most realistic idea, and Lee and I were only able to finish the mechatronic parts of the project by the end of IAP. Here’s a timelapse of it running some hardcoded paths–it’s kind of hard to see, but the carriage is moving up and down to vary the stroke width of the brush pen, moving multiple axes at the same time, etc. In particular, the variable width ovals require simultaneous movements in x, y, z, and yaw.

We also realized that generating/extracting a five-dimension calligraphy stroke path is, like, a whole other project in and of itself. All things considered, I’m really proud of what we grinded out, especially with basically no electronics experience going in (which you can probably tell from the massive electronics board that should have just been a pcb). It was a great learning experience, fueled by many late nights in the Metropolis electronics mezzanine and Hershey’s dark chocolates.

4 – paintings and drawings

Painting and drawing are my bread and butter mediums, so I ended up with a good amount of sketchbook pages over the course of 2024. However, in the middle of the spring semester, my iPad decided to randomly turn off and never turn on again, and I lost over four years of Procreate files (the digital drawing app I use). I had fortunately exported and saved most of the completed paintings I liked, but it still sucked a lot to lose what was essentially my sketchbook since high school.

An unexpected yet welcome consequence of this, though, was that I began to fall back in love with physical mediums over the summer. This was also because I was back at home in my childhood room, where I had left allll my art supplies back in 2022, from old dried up acrylic paints to wads of felt to, for some reason, a bag of 20+ oil pastel sticks all in the same color. It was a fun time :)

As the fall semester came into view, I traded in my iPad carcass for a smaller, more lightweight version (12.9”->11”), redownloaded Procreate, and started painting digitally again. I’m especially proud of these ones:

I feel like I stepped away from painting and drawing in the past year, as newer, more exciting mediums took the spotlight, but I really want to return to them in the upcoming year. I don’t think I’ve necessarily gotten worse, but I have felt a lot of my core rendering and composition skills start to dissipate. Basically.. I need to get back on the grind 🏃

5 – a ceramic fountain that melted in the kiln

So I actually started this back in fall/winter of 2023, but I’m listing it here because I “finished” it in 2024. And by finished I mean I forgot what 
        cone
      
of clay I used for it – evidently, a lower one than 6, because when we tried glaze firing the piece at cone 6, it promptly melted into a puddle of burnt clay. I’m glad I got these nice pictures of it before that, though, and at least now I don’t have to figure out where to store it :’).

before the glaze firing

It’s a fountain, and the shards of stained glass in the base and breasts were supposed to anneal in the kiln to resemble water. The piece is about how we idolize and worship the bodies of women, but in doing so, trap them in place and hollow them out.

6 – printed matter for infinite magazine and mit gala

I make graphics for 
        Infinite Magazine
      
 and 
        MIT Gala
      
! This year, I’m really happy that I got the chance to work on more experimental graphic design, like these laser-cut tickets and programs for the gala back in May. I love a good poster, but it’s cool to make graphics for more unique form factors.

laser-cut tickets:

programs:

plus, various flyers:

I feel like I didn’t grow that much as a graphic designer this year, since I’m no longer consistently making posters for LSC. Instead, when Infinite or Gala needed graphics made, I kind of just scrambled to put something together in Illustrator. I’m still happy with what I made, but next year, I want to work on more large-scale (personal!) design projects, such as zines, prints, and maybe (!) designing and illustrating a 
        calendar
      
.

7 – iceland.mp4

We went to Iceland!!!! A separate blog on this from Teresa and me is coming So Soon. I brought my old canon powershot with me, which I’ve had since like middle school, and took a bunch of footage to assemble into a vlog. I won’t link it here since it’ll be in our joint blog, but it was fun to mix and layer the clips and audio together to make a little memory capsule of the trip.

a screencap

8 – metal clothing

Last year, for Infinite Magazine Issue 12, I led a spread entitled 
        6061
      
, and I was blessed with an amazing team:

fabrication: teresa, lee, lindsay, nando; photo: michelle; styling: joanna; modeling: sabine, bukunmi; writing: sabine

We worked with laser-cut sheet metal to make the garments, sliced and bent and fastened into natural forms that molded to our models’ bodies. You can see the full spread (and issue) here, but I’ll include the two pieces that I specifically made: a face-head-mask-headset thing and a corset-chestplate thing (really great names I know). 

headpiece:

bodypiece:

I also assembled much of the final eight-page layout of the spread, though it was really a huge group effort—shoutout to everyone who stayed for the final all-nighter push. As an example, the layout below showcased the bodypiece:

with poetry by sabine!

Much like the plotter project, I also meant to write an entire blog about 6061, but then too much time passed and I have the memory of a goldfish. However, I will say that it was so cool to work with a group of people on a project with so many moving pieces (literally!), and I’m really grateful to Infinite for enabling me to meet so many other creative people.

9 – a kinetic lamp

During IAP, Nervous System, a design studio founded by two MIT alum, hosted a workshop centered around their computational technique of creating 3D surfaces using flat laser-cut metal/paper shapes. Using their tech, I wanted to make a lamp because I thought the porous light would create a nice effect paired with some overlapping movement.

(nervous system wrote the mesh generation software actually making this possible so i don’t really count this as my project tbh but i think it looks cool still)

10 – with teresa, three cyanotype cameras

This semester, Teresa and I were partners in 4.031 (Design: Objects and Interaction)! The prompt for the first project was to make an analog camera capable of producing long-exposure cyanotype images, and we made the following set of three cylindrical cameras:

We constructed these guys from 3D-printed resin parts and cardboard tubes we found in the scrap bin. Inspired by telescopes and camping equipment like thermoses, we wanted to create a camera that produced circular images, could point in any direction, and could be easily taken on the go.

11 – also with teresa, one digital camera

The prompt for the second 4.031 project was to make a digital camera. However, the definition of “camera” was used quite loosely in this class, and we were encouraged to think more broadly about technologies involving the use of image capture, environmental sensing, etc. Interested in the ideas of 1) producing physical media through digital methods and 2) gamification, Teresa and I made this! It’s kind of hard to explain, but basically it’s an instant camera that prints out your image on thermal paper, combined with a DDR-style light matching game; how well the user plays determines how denoised their output image is.

The printed images are pretty low-res, partly because the Arduino Mega doesn’t have enough memory to store the entire output of the camera module, partly because the thermal printer can only do either black or white output for each pixel. They look pretty cool printed out though, and are sometimes recognizable as real objects. Here are some examples:

And here’s a 2x video of it in action:

(the picture it took in the video was of the ceiling in the photobooth, where we were recording. i have no idea why the screen displayed gibberish for the first few rounds but it’s okay)

This project consumed our lives for the last two weeks of the 
        semester
      
, as we locked ourselves in Metropolis or N52 almost every day, manufacturing parts, soldering, and testing. It’s not perfect, but I’m really proud of what we were able to make. The body and handles of the camera are constructed from powder-coated bent sheet metal, with black resin parts on the top and bottom; the electronics components include a thermal printer, LCD screen, camera module, big arcade button + 8 small white buttons, and the 8 LEDs on top.

A big part of this class, beyond functionality, was the object’s design language and user experience, so we spent a lot of time polishing little details like making the handles nice and ergonomic and ensuring that the screen was angled to face the user.

ignore the watermark lmao

12 – more graphic design

Not much to say about this… some other graphics. Some of these were on commission so I got paid for them :-D

13 – bowl

(that I gifted to a friend)

b] decisions

Besides actual physical things, I also made some decisions this year, some softer, some firmer.

From freshman year until sophomore spring, I was a proud course 2A-6, aka mechanical engineering with a focus on computing. Back in 2022, I had entered MIT as a wide-eyed freshman, freshly graduated from four years of high school robotics, so naturally, I picked the major that seemed best adapted to making robots: mechanical engineering! After taking and soundly enjoying 
        2.003 and 2.004
      
, I felt affirmed in my decision to be a roboticist, and went on to take 
        6.4200
      
 in the spring, a project-based class that simultaneously took years off my lifespan and instilled in me even more determination to pursue robotics.

However, over this past summer and fall semester, I felt my interest in robotics wane. This was partly due to my experience at my summer job, where I worked on path planning algorithms at an autonomous vehicle company (which are kind of just massive mobile robots). On paper, this sounds really cool, and I was super excited to get started, but I found that the work in practice was much less exciting than the work in theory. This is largely out of necessity – software that’s going to be deployed on real-life self-driving cars needs to undergo rigorous, lengthy testing, because the consequences could be dire (aka collisions). However, I found that the majority of my time was spent tweaking small variables, running tests, and generally feeling somewhat detached from the work I was doing. This might have just been how things work at this particular organization, and I’m sure things are different at other robotics-y companies, but the experience did help burst the robot-shaped bubble I had constructed around myself for the past two years.

[There were other reasons for this burst as well – first, that many (not all, but many) robotics and autonomy companies in the US work with the US military/DoD in some way, a cause that I’m not personally willing to work for; and second, that cutting-edge robotics research is increasingly focused on AI and learning-based methods, and I am unfortunately not very interested in AI.]

But, now that I had taken a step back from idealizing robotics, I could turn and face an overarching feeling I’ve had during my time at MIT – a slow drifting away from science and engineering. To contextualize this, though, we’ve got to go back to 2021…

When I was applying to colleges in senior year of high school, I very seriously considered going to an art school for illustration or graphic design. I had split my time in high school half and half between engineering and the arts, and I felt very strongly about both–but after getting into MIT, there was almost no question that I would attend, for a few reasons. First, there’s no denying the prestige and stability that come with a degree from MIT, and although these things may not be as important in the long run, to a 17-year old, they were important – and even more so to my parents, who had, in large part, come to this country so that I could have them. Second, I did truly love STEM, a core part of my identity at that point; and third, I hadn’t gotten into those top art programs that I wanted, and it was, by all means, a blow to my creative confidence. So I bought a MIT crewneck off Ebay, signed my letter, and it was off to CPW. 

I truly love MIT and, looking back, I feel like it was the right decision for me. I’ve learned so much, met so many amazing (amazing!!) people here, and got to try things and access resources I wouldn’t have been able to anywhere else. I’d never take my experiences here for granted. At the same time, many decisions can be “right,” just different, and often I find myself wondering how things would be if I had stepped in another direction. Although paths are never really set in stone, I know that my decision two years ago opened up many doors to me, while simultaneously closing and locking many others.

Now that I’m a junior, I feel a (perhaps unfounded) sense that more doors are closing; some of the figs are falling from the tree, and I need to start thinking about what I really want. This feeling intensified as I watched my peers (both my age and older) make life decisions™: one of my friends dropped out this year to pursue their startup; another went to Taiwan for grad school; yet another decided to accept a full-time job offer and graduate a year early. As for me, my indecision lies in what to study in grad school, if at all, and subsequently pursue as a career. I’ve dropped the idea of seeking robotics research roles, but I’m torn between pursuing something completely creative or something purely technical or something somewhere in between. I’ve heavily considered pivoting to architecture, or staying for my masters at MIT, or trying to become one of those people who makes huge suspended airport installations (??). This semester, I changed my major from 2A-6 to a double major in 6-4 (computer science) and 4-B (design); for now, I’m trying to keep as many doors open as possible.

Although I felt more lost than ever this semester, having let go of the robotic goal I’d bound myself to, I also felt a deep sense of clarity. I know a few things to be true – that I love art, that I love engineering for a purpose, that I love making things with others, and that, ultimately, you end up becoming yourself. And so based on these facts, I’ve made some of those decisions I mentioned earlier. First, in my final three semesters, the majority of the classes I’m taking are design and architecture studios and humanities classes, with the rest solely there to fulfill my graduation requirements. Second, that I’ll pursue grad school of some kind, both to deepen my skillset and to learn more about what’s even possible career-wise. And third, that I ultimately want to end up doing something arts-oriented and impactful on the world, but I’m okay with taking the long way around, maybe working in a more technical field first to build up savings, or working in an adjacent field to build up life and work experience.

And of course there are a lot of other things besides pure enjoyment that go into career decisions: financial viability (!), purported impact on the world, flexibility of work hours and location, and opportunities for growth and advancement. However, I’ve spent much of the last few years doing mental gymnastics to convince myself that I want to be a software or mechanical engineer, and it’s revelatory to hold the truth up in plain sight, that art is what makes me feel connected to myself, others, and the world in a way that few other things do. I don’t feel fear of failure and imposter syndrome in engineering in the same way I do when it comes to creative work, and I think that says something; I know that in the end, I’ll figure out a way to circle back into the arts, however that manifests, and that’s enough of a north star in the night sky for now. :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01-800x800.jpg

hihi i’m back,Anika H. '26,8,2024-12-30T00:00:00-05:00,"i’m gonna keep this short so i can get to posting real content again :p

Reasons why I was gone from the internet last semester:

- drowning in writing Last semester I tried to get all my writing requirements out of the way by taking two CI-Ms (communication intensive class in the major) and a CI-H(communications intensive class in humanities) that resulted in way too many essays for my liking. On the bright side, I didn’t have any final exams so I got to go back home early for the break and visit my old teachers while high-school was still in session. But basically I used up all my writing braincells that I usually save for the blogs and didn’t have too much content left in me. Next semester, I’ll be taking hardcore technicals, so I’m going back to farting on the internet again. i still can’t believe i was actually given a platform for my garbage





i still can’t believe i was actually given a platform for my garbage

- technological issues For most of the past few months, my 10-year old ipad that I usually draw with started having worse battery problems to the point where it got unusable. Every time I took it out of my bag to try and draw, I’d have to charge it for half an hour, and by then I would have had another class or gotten distracted by Tetazoo tea time. At one point, Jebby tried to make me try drawing with MS Paint, and it was the second to worst art experience of my life, topped only by that one time i tried to draw in the rain and my notebook molded overnight. It’s seriously impressive drawing properly using a trackpad. Anyways, art is very very critical to blogs. My writing is far from a literary masterpiece, and I like pretty pictures. I finally got a new ipad over winter break though, so we are back in business.

- a disconnect of sorts? Anika the blogger is kind of a persona I’ve crafted. All the blogs I put out are real stories and parts of my life, but it doesn’t encapsulate my experience at MIT as a whole. somebody told me that i draw myself less realistically than i draw other people. For the past while, everything I could have written about would have seemed a weird and out of character, or at least been uninteresting. Out of all the human worries, I think I’ve only touched on academic stress and a bit of grief. The one time I tried to post something a little deeper, I abstracted it so much to the point people didn’t really understand, and for the next several months, I felt waves of physical cringe wash over me whenever I saw the post. In the end, I committed the cardinal sin of deleting a blog post (sorry Petey). I really admire the bloggers who really pour their entire hearts out, and they have some of the best writing I have read here. I just don’t really have the balls to do that. The blogs are, after all, for the entire internet. This includes people I don’t know, and worse, people I do know who know me. Some of my clowns are to remain in the closet.



somebody told me that i draw myself less realistically than i draw other people.

A list of mildly interesting things that have happened in the meantime:

- I caught my second mouse with my bare hands at MIT

- played radio games for the first time

- shot a real pistol

- dressed up as a character who dressed up as a gnome for halloween

- weaponized a single roach

- rode in the bed of a pickup truck

- did 2 fireshows

- pet kittens in real life for the first time (THEY WERE SMOL AND CUTE AND OH GOD THEY WERE TINY) – one of my friends left his car window open and found a mama cat and three babies the next morning

i am officially in my twenties now, and i’m not sure how to feel about that — aside from old and feeling the automatically programmed midlife crisis begin.

happy whatever you celebrate!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/back-4.jpg

Pictures from a Semester of Classes,Richard O. '28,3,2024-12-29T00:00:00-05:00,"So about a week and a half ago I handed in my last final in Johnson Athletic Center which marked the end of a very long first semester at MIT. So like before, I’m gonna continue to give y’all a glimpse of whatever just happened here these past three months…but with pictures (because I like pictures).

Part 7: The Battles Go On…

So the whole Students and Sleep vs. Professors and PSets Thing? Yea that never ended. But all it takes is a few student center study sessions, a few office hours, and a lot of late-night dining hall food to survive thrive.

 

 

Part 8: Random Things I Did Instead of My Assignments and Studying

This section is pretty much a catchall for all the miscellaneous things I did this semester.

- Can learn more about that building here.

 

- Can read more about Halloween on campus in Janet’s detailed blog here!

 

 

 

 

 

Part 9: MIThenge

Anyways, besides the whole school part of this school, there are a lot of other unique things that happen on this campus during the year, and being a person who loves taking photos, MIThenge was one of those things I was really excited about. In short, there are about two times during the year when the sun aligns perfectly with the infinite, and tons of people crowd the halls to get photos of it…including me.

 

 

Part 10: BU Expedition

So at some point in the middle of the semester one of my friends was like: “Let’s go explore Boston University.”

So we did. Probably the most impulsive yes I’ve ever given. Still enjoyed it and took some fun photos.

 

 

 

So yeah we pretty much just checked out their buildings which all looked really cool.

 

Part 11: The Super Calc PSET group that I had fun locked in with…

As I noted in my first photoblog, PSets are not about the problems, “but rather the friends we make along the way,” and those same people in that dome picture from 
         18.01A 
      
 became some of my closest friends here on campus. So here are some pictures of the stuff we did to have fun lock in this semester.

- Storytime: So one of the TAs for 18.02A has a crazy response time. Like you can send him an email and get a reply in less than 5 minutes. So one night while we were working on an assignment we all got confused over something for one of the questions. So we decided to put his reply speed to the test. Mind you it was 11:30pm when we emailed him and if I ever got an email past 9pm, it wouldn’t get a reply until 8am the next day. So we sent him the email and surely enough in 4 minutes he sent a reply…and then commented on how late it was to be sending him an email. So after feeling a little guilty, we all sent him a thank you photo in response for helping us so late.

 



 

 

 

Part 12: Richie Declares War against “The Institvte” for Finals Season

Finals season. As Aiden beautifully describes in his blog on studying for finals, this part of the semester was more about the math that went into a passing grade than studying for a passing grade. But nonetheless, we balled anyway.

- And no, that wasn’t a typo in the heading. On most of the main buildings on campus, all the U’s are spelled with V’s since they are meant to be in Latin so I like using the school’s government name as it’s written for official business like this.

- 
The MassachVsetts InstitVte of Technology
 

The MassachVsetts InstitVte of Technology

 

In total, I had four finals to prepare for after the last day of classes on Wednesday the 11th:

- Monday: 8.01 (Physics I)

- Tuesday: 5.111 (Chemistry) and 14.01 (Intro to Microeconomics)

- Thursday: 18.02A (Calc II – half the course content because the other half of the course continues through the January IAP term)

Now my biggest opp in this war was chemistry simply because I and that subject don’t have any, so in the same way Aiden imprisoned himself in building 4 to study for physics, I holed myself up in our dorm’s multipurpose room the day following the last day of classes and started brain-dumping everything I could remember from that subject on two large whiteboards. I then made a list of stuff to review that I couldn’t rewrite from memory and after doing this I started to realize that this method really helped me draw the line between what I did and didn’t know in a class so I ended up doing the same thing for all the other classes I had finals for and at some point I started to feel like a maniac who was just scribbling non-sense equations on a wall.

 

 

- So after that Thursday of pure chem review, I put together the remainder of my action plan for the next 7 days of war.

 



 

- So the weekend flew by with me reviewing pretty much everything except calc cause I had all Wednesday to review for it and very soon it was Monday and time for my…third…final of the year (I already had finals for 6.100A – “Intro to Comp Sci” and 18.01A – “Calc I” since they were half terms prior to this).

- Now side note, MIT is very lucky to have some really cool physics faculty. For example, one of our physics instructors runs an Instagram channel with 1.1M followers as of the moment I’m writing this whose videos you may have stumbled upon while watching Instagram reels or something. Another has spent the past 40 years teaching the 8.01 course at MIT and it just so happens that the class section I was in this semester that he teaches turned out to be the last physics course he would ever lecture so on the very last day of school this semester, the entire physics department came out to celebrate him while he was trying to explain some practice problems to us and it was all really wholesome (He’s also the same professor from that slide at the beginning of this blog that “teaches you patience”).
  
  
        
                
                  
                  
      
      
        
          
                      A picture of the cake the physics department got for this professor's last day of teaching 8.01. 
                  
      
        
          
                      Picture of Mohamed giving a speech about the professor.
                  
      
        
          
                      A very thought-provoking picture of this professor in south America at the age of 21 that he shared with us at the end of this review session noting that his favorite part of teaching for 40 years was the students.

        Previous

        Next
      
    
  


 

- And last but not least, the final instructor that I got to interact with this semester was one whose name is probably very familiar to a lot of people on campus simply because of how much he helps the entire 8.01 community when it comes to physics exams. But Mohamed, as Aidan notes in the Tuesday section of his blog, is actually such an amazing person and professor that if he asked me to be a physics major personally, I would probably consider it…for a few moments before reverting back to a comp sci major. But pretty much, whenever it comes to exams, this professor drops these 4-hour-long review videos that after putting on 2x speed will make the whole 8.01 community feel like they somehow magically downloaded all the information that they need for an exam and it actually makes sense. So the moment I get a Canvas notification saying “Mohamed sent you a message in Canvas” right before an exam, I know I’m ready for anything.

So anyways:

- Monday. 8.01. 9AM. Johnson Athletic Center. Just me, my pencil, and my knowledge from the review video. 

- 3 hours later. Noon. Test Complete. Boom. Knocked out. Beat that battle and had three more to go. Richie: 1, Institvte: 0

 

Tuesday was two finals back to back. Chem and Econ. Econ was chill so I spent most of that Monday going over chem again. So back to the whiteboards I went.

 

- Tuesday. 5.111. 9AM. Johnson Athletic Center. Just me, my pencil, a calculator, and my brain still trying to convince myself that there’s logic behind the whole particle in a box model and I wasn’t being brainwashed by “big chem” into believing the whole thing isn’t made up.

- 3 hours later. Noon. Complete. Boom. Knocked out. Was actually so much better than I thought it was. 2 more tests to go. Richie: 2, Institvte: 0

 

 

 

- Tuesday. 14.01. 1:30PM. Johnson Athletic Center. Just me, my pencil, and my love-hate relationship with Econ. 

- 2 hours later. 3:30PM. Complete. Boom. Knocked out. That final was probably the nicest thing that class treated us to all semester. 1 more tests to go. Richie: 3, Institvte: 0 

 

At last, we were down to one last battle. 18.02A (Calc II). Genuinely love that class. Used the remainder of that Tuesday as a mental break from finals and took some time to myself and then locked in the whole day on Wednesday and used the same whiteboard method I’d been using previously with some practice problems they posted for us.

 

Also had a mini 8.01 final grade reveal over Buffalo Wild Wings with some friends that Wednesday.

 

- Thursday. 18.02A. 9AM. Johnson Athletic Center. Just me, my pencil, and .5 photos that the professor and course instructor let me take of them and my friends right before we started. 

- 2 hours later. 11AM. Complete. Boom. Knocked out. No more exams. I was free. War was over. I could go home! Richie: 4, Institvte: 0

FREEDOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.




Part 13: The Greatest Prison Break Out of the Century…Richie Goes Home

Afterward, I had 3 hours to clean my room, pack 2 weeks of clothes, and get some food before my Uber to the airport got to campus. So after a quick Dunkin’ trip, I walked back to my dorm and started packing while enjoying my newfound freedom accompanied by my favorite music.

 

So the Uber arrived around 2:30ish and I and the three other friends I rode with got to the airport around 3ish. So from there we all took a group photo together and headed our separate ways into our different terminals. Took me about half an hour to get through TSA and reach my gate and from there I just chilled and listened to music for some hours while waiting for my plane.  And it was once I got in my seat that I decided to take time and really reflect on all that had happened this past semester.

In the span of four months, I had done so many new things and met so many new and amazing people. I took classes that really tested my limits but also took classes that reminded me why I enjoyed learning in the first place. I found spaces and mentors that have helped me to continue exploring my goals and passions here on campus. I learned a lot about myself, the ways I learn, the ways I deal with stress, and the ways I interact with others. And despite how challenging it all felt, I’m just really glad to have found a way to grow from everything this semester and really look forward to taking all these lessons into my future semesters here.

Part 14: To be continued…

I’ll see yall in May/June for the end of this trilogy. Try and guess what the title of the last edition will be between now and then.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4935-800x1067.jpg

new york without i*stagram,Janet G. '27,1,2024-12-29T00:00:00-05:00,"i’m starting this entry at an airport at 5am. sometimes waking up way too early for a flight has its benefits: you get to sit in an airport, people watch, and reflect on how you should compensate for your irresponsible spending by writing a blog.

i was in new york over the past few days (mainly for christmas), and due to a mixture of factors both within and outside my control, i had an overall pretty mid time. it wasn’t awful, but considering how much all of my friends raved about this city i was pretty disappointed with my experience here.

i’ll get the hate out of my system first. i’ll preface it by saying that this is my very biased personal take, subject to change blah blah blah


        midtown manhattan
      
 is the epitome of late stage capitalism, and you could take that as either a compliment or an insult depending on your personal philosophies. personally, i find it a little comical that one of the most famous attractions in the city is a set of massive advertisement billboards. 

i dislike that the big draw of this city is to find different ways to spend a lot of money. 
        everywhere is extremely crowded,
      
 people are always tense and hurried, and you have to watch your step to avoid stepping in some trash-filled puddle every few minutes. even the rich pieces of culture felt underwhelming and couldn’t improve my opinion of the place. at some point, the beautiful pieces of the Met start conflating into one glittery blur and you start thinking about how you could probably estimate the number of lives it took to make these extravagant jewellery pieces. 

broadway was very well produced, and while it was cool to see some big names live, i didn’t like the numbers of 
        this musical
      
 and thus couldn’t ignore the underdevelopment of plot and characters that felt jarring to me. 

with all of that said, there is something iconic about new york that doesn’t allow you to fully hate it. there’s an infectious sense of wonder when you’re wandering the streets and see everyone dressed up in their best fits and beaming at the camera. there’s always a lot of energy in the streets. complaints about the Met and Broadway aside, they are some of the most iconic places in the world for a reason. you couldn’t find another museum that was as extensive and well-curated — every exhibit was placed with care and intention, it would take me years to get through and understand the richness of every piece of history there. as much as the musical numbers failed to latch onto me, the dances and set was still fantastic, the song delivery was powerful and incredibly clear, and i’m not sure when else i’d get a chance to have jordan fisher be literally less than 4 feet away from me. 

i also enjoyed 
        walking through central park,
      
 grabbing a lox bagel at liberty bagels despite the lines and price, and seeing the 
        new york skyline at the rockefeller center.
      
 new york city is The City, after all, and there are some things you should just tick off for the sake of it.

knowing what you personally enjoy while travelling is important. travelling without an express purpose — without my family or other people planning my itinerary — forces you to think about your own desires rather than what your parents/team leaders want. the most interesting conclusion i gained from this trip is that not having instagram has really changed what i want. 

for context, i deactivated my accounts sometime in the fall semester. there are really valid use cases for instagram: staying in touch with friends, stalking your crush’s tagged posts and occasionally trying to send them a reel for no reason at all, proving to your haters that you’re living a better life than them with your matcha latte at the cutest coffee shop ever, so on so forth. i just primarily used mine to send my friends deranged memes and post unhinged stories about my transport debacles. one day i decided that this was not worth it and decided to leave and never go back. 

during the semester i was mostly too busy to realise the impact that no instagram had on me. being in new york gave me a lot of whiplash — after all, is this not the most instagrammable city of all time? i grabbed my rainbow lox bagel and 
        after taking a bite of it first,
      
 i took a photo and paused for a moment as i realised that i was trying to get the perfect lighting to show how beautiful the cross-section was. but like, why was i doing that? it’s not like i was going to post this on instagram to prove that i went to a cute place with a cute bagel. i also personally care about the taste of the bagel much more than the appearance, and the rainbow bagel just literally looks good. 

so you can tell that i ate a bite before i remembered that the proper way to take a cute bagel pic was to open it and show the halves… anyway it was good

the same thing happened everywhere else i went. realising that i no longer had to perform for some imaginary audience forced me to confront why i cared about the perfect photo. for some contexts, this still mattered; i think it’s totally valid to want to create and keep the best memento of your experience at certain places. if i had to pay like 50 dollars to go stand in the wind above a bunch of light pollution then my photos better be good. but also i realised that for some places it’s just not worth it — times square felt like a spectacle meant for the optimised instagram algorithm; the bright lights are supposed to capture your attention as you apathetically tap through a bunch of stories.

i like not having instagram. it means that i have to work harder to prove to myself why i want certain kinds of life experiences, beyond the idea of “i can make a post on instagram and get some gratifying likes”. maybe this takes the fun away from many decisions, such as why i decided to take a $3 premium to get the rainbow bagel over the NYT-recommended everything bagel. but also, maybe this means that the next time i come back to new york, i can go visit places i know i actually want, rather than places i feel like i should go for some experience that i was replicating based on everyone else’s curated stories. i no longer have instagram as a sample set anyway.

in some ways, i felt the same incentive structure when it came to writing my college application essays. i framed myself as a very specific kind of person so that i could draw attention to myself in the hopes that the admission officers would notice me and admit me. i mean, it worked. but what i also found very useful was to look at my essays and ask myself, what do i actually want? is this an authentic version of myself? and maybe this is a question you should answer after your college application season is over, because you just really need to get your essays out before the looming deadline and you’re stressed. but most of my favourite essays that i wrote — essays that i specifically wrote for specific schools because the prompts spoke to me — come from a place of authenticity. don’t be afraid to write about something that you feel like doesn’t fit your portfolio or narrative that you’re trying to build. 

one of the best pieces of writing advice that i got from my short stories professor last semester was that “every good piece of writing has some piece of a beating heart inside”. for every school i was admitted to i could point to one or two essays that i wrote exclusively for them because i really liked their prompt. don’t get me wrong — there’s a practice amongst people to copy and paste essays with minimal edits for multiple schools, and i think you should know that this is a reasonable and often necessary practice to make sure that you don’t go insane applying to too many schools at once. especially if you’re still looking at schools to apply to, you should most definitely do this copy-pasting thing so that you can toss your hat into the rng ring. 

but i encourage you to not worry about the idea of trying to make the AO admit you — to take off the instagram-style filter of “would my audience like this and give me some gratifying likes?” — and engage directly with the prompts and stories yourself. what do these prompts mean to you? what is the story that you want to tell?

i also highly recommend this essay for you to procrastinate on if you’re stressed about writing. the tl;dr is that you could consider my thoughts above as advice on how to write your college essays, but you could also consider the reverse of my advice, which is basically that you should not be too authentic. maybe not everyone wants to hear about your crippling addiction to genshin impact because you wanted that specific ganyu skin, and instead they want to hear you explain why you actually wanted to lead the n-th nonprofit teaching kids maths in the area.

i’ll close off by saying that i know this period is rough, and i’m sorry you’re still stuck in this sense of limbo. i fondly remember the two weeks before college applications were due to be the worst two weeks of my life (hyperbole), and i did a lot of coping because i was stressed out and overthought about how my life was contingent on 
        some random guy’s 5 minute skim and the sandwich they ate that day.
      
 here were some of my favourite ways to destress during trying times:

- orangutan jungle school which is the CUTEST

- some excellent short films i watched (the kiwi one is a personal fav and i am not biased at all. honestly if you look up short films you’ll find a few good ones. they taught me a lot about storytelling and gave me a break without making me too guilty) UPDATE: the first link is now updated with the kiwi short film… mortifying i didn’t realise that i accidentally linked the wrong thing.

how i (kinda) studied for finals,Aiden H. '28,3,2024-12-22T00:00:00-05:00,"If you are reading this, it means I am successfully on my way out of Boston after surviving my first MIT finals season. The verdict? Lukewarm.

As has been explained a million times and will be a million more, MIT freshman have ~PNR~ their first semester. This means all classes are reported as either Pass (for what would be an 
        A, B, or C
      
) or No Record, implying that it isn’t reported on your transcript at all (for what would be a D or F).

There are a few existing camps of advice on how to abuse your PNR experience:

- Go AWOL all semester and then just try to pass the exams

- Show up and do the psets but don’t study at all for the exams

- Use this as a time to experiment with different study techniques without the risk of failure

Above all us, every upperclassman has one piece of advice: enjoy it.

Naturally, a mental battle began the first week of classes. Will my laziness and desire to have fun allow me to fully utilize PNR, or will my need for academic validation win? As with everything, it was somewhere in the middle, and that couldn’t be more clearly shown than my entirely sporadic and 
        vibes-based
      
 study schedule for finals.

***

THE LAST WEEK OF CLASSES

Monday – Calculate the Scores I Need to Pass

So far, I haven’t really locked in with the full PNR mindset. I did every pset for every class and 
        never skipped lecture unless I had a genuine conflict
      
. My exam scores had been fine and getting better, but nothing so cracked that I didn’t have to take my finals.

Like every master procrastinator, instead of just starting to study and trying to do well, I immediately decided it would be best to spend an hour doing phone-app math to find my current grades in classes and decide what I would need to NR a class.

The situation (aka scores needed to pass):
        5.111
      
 – 40.16%


        8.01
      
 – like a 50? no one knows


        17.41
      
 – 9.17%


        18.02
      
 – 29.63%

8.01 has a policy where your have exams have to pass an undecided “exam average”. I assumed the worst it would be was a 70 (since I think that’s the lowest they can make passing?) and moved on.

From these I decided I was chilling and ended up not worrying for days until the anxiety eventually crept up.

 

Tuesday & Wednesday – Procrastinate

To be fair, these were the last two days of classes so it’s not as if I did nothing, I just didn’t do anything except go to class for like two hours (oops!).

I did print out the 8.01 exam equation sheet to try and convince myself to study, but using a printer is hard so I decided that was enough mental effort towards physics for one afternoon.

 

Thursday – Begin to Freak Out

Thursday was the first day we didn’t have classes, so I aptly decided it was time to begin the cram for 8.01. The professors released a disgusting amount of practice problems, so I started by doing 5 that they released specifically as “past exam problems”.

At a certain point I can’t stand to sit at my desk chair in my dorm anymore, so I search for an empty classroom across campus to study in instead.

my chalkboards from rotting in building 4

These problems were, to say the least, not reassuring in my ability to pass the final! I ended up having to look at the solutions for help on all problems to varying degrees, so I starred the problems as ones I needed to redo later.

I after I left the classroom, I went back to my room for a “break”, which meant I accidentally watched nothing on YouTube for 3 hours, went to dinner, and then went to bed!

 

Friday – 8.01 Review

After my Thursday-night failure, I decided to get up 
        early
      
 to go into Boston and escape campus. I went to the 
        Tatte at Copley Square,
      
 bought the most delicious, obnoxious looking salad you’ve ever seen, and started watching the four hour review video for 8.01.

After about two hours in Tatte, I went to the Boston Public Library reading room in hopes that the pretty architecture and 200 students suffering with me would better my spirits. I finished the review video and started doing the rest of the practice problems.

As we can see, I did not do all of the practice problems

Once I got back to 
        Maseeh,
      
 I ended up on the phone calling random people I know all night, so I spent another evening not studying 👍.

 

Saturday – Remember You Have Other Classes

Saturday was a fever dream. This was the day I fell victim to rotting at my desk doing practice problems all day. I begrudgingly opened 
        MITx
      
 and did more physics practice problems.

You would think that the last weekend of the semester would be crazy and fun and exciting, but instead it was desk and physics and more desk.

“what does MIT look like?”

I of course grew bored and angered at physics after a couple hours, so I decided I would start studying for the other exams I had not even 24 hours after the 8.01 exam. Quizlet dropped a beta version of their new game, so I played Blocks™ to review the ~150 terms I needed for my 17.41 exam. 5.111 also posted the review video for the session I did not go to, so I opened the tab, said I was going to watch it, and then didn’t watch it.

 

Sunday – Give Up

I mean can you blame me? Sunday I was unmotivated and tired, so I glanced over equations for a while, but I pretty much just read and went to be early. I even exercised as a form of procrastination, which demonstrates how dire the situation was. My roommates were on the grind,  but I sent all my energy to them and wished them luck.

 

FINALS WEEK

Monday – 8.01

I woke up at the ass-crack of dawn (8:00 A.M.) and frantically scrolled through all my notes before trekking over to the 
        Johnson Track
      
.

The exam was 1) not fun 2) not easy 3) not there to help my grade, so I had a crisis in my dorm before laying down for 3 hours and watching The Substance with Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley.

Eventually I realized that I had two more exams the next day, one of which I hadn’t started studying for, so the grind restarted, but this time with 5.111.

 

I went through the same process I did for 5.111, just a lot faster. Watch the review video, look over notes, do practice problems. I felt a lot more confident in chemistry anyway, so I wasn’t tweaking going into the final. I also needed a lot lower of a grade to pass, so I let Jesus take the wheel.

 

Tuesday – 5.111 and 17.41

Oh look, I’m back on Johnson Track for 3 more hours!!!🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️

The chemistry test was one of the thickest packets that you have ever seen (25+ pages), but I managed to conquer through it in time to go to a UROP meeting, and then straight to my 17.41 final. After four hours of testing, I decided I didn’t really care about my grade at that point, so I wrapped up my essays early to go collapse in bed.

Side quest: Freaking out over my 8.01 grade! Our beloved 8.01 professor Mohammed was both optimistic and depleting all my hope on 
        Piazza
      
.

 

Wednesday – Start Studying for 18.02

I was lucky enough to have a day without finals in the middle of the week, so I started reviewing material for 18.02 24 hours before the exam yet again. I went back to a classroom in building 4 and redid all of the midterms on the chalkboards while blasting the Wicked soundtrack, Doechii, and SZA.

I spent the rest of the night at my desk doing the practice midterm, and clonking out early enough for my required 8 hours of sleep before the exam.

 

Thursday – 18.02

I woke up yet again way too early, got nauseated by the crisp morning air, and walked to 
        10-250
      
. Overall it felt fine? Talking to my roommate after 
        I definitely made some stupid mistakes,
      
 
        but there’s not way I failed.
      


I went to Newbury Street and spend a not-good amount of money on new clothes, and then packed for my 5:00 A.M. flight out of there.

***

I still don’t know half of my exam scores, so I can’t say whether or not my lack of studying technique was a success, but there are still a few lessons from PNR I need to remember next semester:

- Do the readings before class – This is what every upperclassman told me and I still refused to do it. My classes this semester weren’t incredibly difficult, but 
        once classes get harder
      
 and more foreign, I’ll have to utilize this so I’m being proactive instead of playing catchup on material.

- Study less for longer – Cramming is definitely not my style, especially considering the exam content was more conceptual than plug-and-chug with equations to memorize.

- C’s get degrees – It’s really not that serious. Yes GPA matters, but if I’m fine getting a C now, I’m fine getting a C later. Not that they are the goal, but if it’s a hard class I hate, there’s no reason I should be a master of the content!

tl;dr I could study more, but couldn’t we all?","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241210_181906-800x1067.jpg

parallel universe,Kai V. '25,13,2024-12-19T00:00:00-05:00,"Text transcript:

Many times this semester, I felt disappointed in myself. It’s not a new sensation. But after all these years, I still don’t have any advice, just a feeling. A long, cold plummet into guilt and shame over a failure that feels misunderstood by others, and an emergence into a slightly parallel universe: one where everything remains the same, except for the wet sheen of dejection, weighing upon you alone.

But – look up – this parallel universe is also one where art transports you elsewhere, if only for a few hours; one where a weekend trip with friends makes you feel whole again; one where you are learning and growing all the time; one where you try new things and expand your sense of what is possible; one where the future still stretches out ahead of you, opaque, diffuse, waiting to be molded into reality.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/blog.png,1
MIT Early Action Decisions Now Available Online,Chris Peterson SM '13,0,2024-12-17T00:00:00-05:00,"MIT Early Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2029 are now available in the application portal. To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking View Update. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update. 

This year, 12,053 students applied early to the MIT Class of 2029, and as of *checks watch* right now, we have offered early admission to 721. Though they are all different in their own way —  mechanics and muralists, plantdads and playwrights, tenors and tinkerers  — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with MIT’s mission to use science, technology, and the useful arts to make the world a better place. We can’t wait to welcome them to campus to join the 4,535 outstanding undergraduates already enrolled at MIT. 

We deferred 7486 applicants; these students will be reconsidered without prejudice in Regular Action, with decisions released sometime in March. If you are deferred, you are not expected to send us any new information besides the February Updates and Notes Form, which will be posted in mid-January to your application portal. We have posted more information for deferred students here; you can also read posts from bloggers who were deferred here, here, here, here, here, here, and most recently here.    

Given the competitiveness of our pool, we have also informed 3,039 students that we will not be able to offer them admission this year. This decision has been made with care, and it is final. I know this can be a difficult decision to receive, but trust me: it works out okay in the end. Take a deep breath, shake it out, and go crush the rest of your college applications (or whatever else you choose to do) this year.

The balance of our applicants —  807 —  withdrew from our process before we issued their decision.  

We recognize it’s a lot of effort for all of you to apply to MIT. It’s an honor and a privilege for us to read your applications. Thank you for sharing your story with us. 

Again, congratulations to the newest members of the Class of 2029. I’ll be closing comments on this post to focus the conversations on the open threads for admitted, deferred, and not admitted students. 

All best, everyone; wishing you a healthy and happy end of 2024, and bright beginnings to 2025.",,0

holidays in boston,Aiden H. '28,3,2024-12-16T00:00:00-05:00,"It’s officially finals season admissions season cuffing season holiday season, and I’m coming in hot, live from my bed watching Frozen instead of studying for my 
        8.01 final tomorrow.
      
 And despite the genuine lack of any holiday spirit inside of me, I have done a very minor amount of holiday-themed things around campus/Boston to remind us all to have at least a little holiday joy and optimism (whether or not you’re awaiting finals, admissions decisions, or just the general end of the world tomorrow).

Important Side Note: I have a Samsung so I cannot personally be responsible for the bad quality on half of these pictures. Blame the tech, not the player or something.

Campus Decorations

Awaiting me from my definitely giddy and eager return from Thanksgiving break was the campus suddenly decorated with more winter things.

My high school went mildly hard for Christmas decorating by covering our skylights with red and green paper and turning off all overhead lighting in favor of string lights in the halls. Luckily, MIT did not disappoint when it came to abusing the pretty parts of its architecture in favor of the winter aesthetic.

Said decorations from the inside of lobby 7

Also in an attempt to spice up the awful, drab, non-Christmassy exterior of 
        the stud,
      
 they put up a little strip-mall style Christmas set-up. A+ for effort, but idk if anyone has actually taken photos on this thing.

Do I give more snowman-with-a-bad-fashion-sense or burnt-gingerbread-girl?


        Lobby 10
      
 also has had a random run of holiday festivities, from a couple of pop-up shops to a performance of holiday music by different MIT musical groups.

Boston Tree Lighting

Second chronologically was the annual Boston tree lighting across the river at the Boston Commons. I convinced my roommates and some friends to go the Thursday after Thanksgiving break and participate in traditional, Hallmark-esque winter festivities.

It was also here that I had my yearly crisis where I somehow find myself ice skating and get violently angry at how bad I am.

It was after this that we made our way towards the main stage/tree area, scarfed down the most 7/10 $10 funnel cake, and listened to the performers while waiting for the tree lighting at 8.

At last, the mayor of Boston and 
        Santa
      
 were brought out to give the tree her official glow-up.

MIT Winterfest

Last week, MIT had a “Winterfest”, which to my chagrin was a glorified excuse for MIT to give everyone a bunch of free food and ambiance. So one cold and lonely night, I walked my way through 
        hell and back
      
 to go to Stata.

My roommate had just come from his final paper defense for philosophy and I had a 
        UROP
      
 meeting, so we ended up lingering around and getting seconds of some of the food while 
        gossiping
      
 our rare adventures outside of our room and the dining hall past 4:00 P.M.

Unfortunately now my level of festivities has drastically declined as I mobilize with the rest of the undergraduate population for our week of bloody combat ahead, but at least like in real war, there will be a period of peace surrounding Christmas.

I wish everyone luck with everything that is going on this upcoming week, and just remember that giving up on life and binge eating cookies for an hour is justified!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241205_160250-400x300.jpg

simfinite hopscotch!,Ellie F. '28,2,2024-12-15T00:00:00-05:00,"MIT is about risk. It’s a place where you put yourself out there, face possible criticism, to realize your full potential. In my case, I sent my very first email to dormspam, a mailing list that reaches most of the undergrad population, making myself vulnerable to starting a flame war (or worse!!). This was all in order to reach my highest goal, my dream: to make a hopscotch down Vassar St, or the Simfinite. Anyways, here’s the email I pored over for so long.

my undergrad reputation is riding on this

I ordered a 64 pack of chalk, which would definitely be enough, unless someone got really hungry. Around 2pm, my roommate, a few other friends, and I descended to begin the odyssey. We started brewing up strategies, designating some people to squares, and others to numbers. I was on number duty, and as it turns out, counting upwards is pretty damn hard. What comes after 33? My roommate Anoushka and I agreed that there’s literally no way to tell.

About an hour in, the ogs had to leave, but a revolving door of chalkers started helping out. I made peace with the dust that would forevermore inhabit my mouth and throat. We started running out of chalk faster than free food disappears on campus. Still, we kept the sad chalky nubs of what had been to decorate milestone squares like 100, and then 200, and then 300, and then…

In the 800s, we encountered a dilemma. Should we continue down Vassar St., or cross to the other side, where most students turn towards the Z Center? After holding court, the jury decided to cross. We created a very accurate pair of Portals of hit vi🅱️eo game fame, as well as a warning to cross safely.

After five hours, nearly 64 sticks of chalk, and about a quarter mile, we made it to the 1000th square! We decorated it with a giant finish line, and Wyatt and Caroline both did runs. After basically doing squats nonstop for so long, I declined hopping it for the time being.

Unfortunately, the rain washed our creation away just three days later. But entropy destroys everything in the end, and hopscotch is inherently ephemeral, a wisp of joy and beauty that can only be there for a weekend, and then gone…

…

JUST KIDDING LMAO HOPSCOTCH IS FOREVER

Tape is notable for being sticky. Josh decided to put this principle into use by buying 144 rolls of quarter-inch blue tape. It was a total of $14, and each roll was 55 yards. Josh wants to note that one week after his purchase, the price of blue tap doubled, so clearly the sellers realized the true worth of their product.

It took a while to figure out a good taping time, but about a month after the original hopscotch, we got together on a Sunday morning and started work. It went much slower than chalk, but we got into a groove much faster this time. Much experimentation was carried out regarding the best way to make each number.

two different styles of 6 in the same square by the same person. and in the end, we converged on a different style of 6

We went for a brunch break, and upon returning, resolved to get to square 256, which would be about 2.5 total hours of work. We got to our goal faster than any of us expected, and spent the rest of our time nerdifying select squares.

That weekend, there were so many kiddos on campus!! So, we got the joy of seeing our hard work being enjoyed by toddlers wrapped in bright puffy coats. Cue a collective awwwwwwweeee <3 One dad was even explaining to his kid all the nerd things, like what pi or a summation is!!

We soon discovered that not all of us were as adept at hopscotching as the mini-humans. While I, a natural, finished it in 55.12 seconds, a few of us… struggled. Not to name any names of course :)

Oh look! We got some reviews!

“Seeing kids do it was very fun. In a world in which mit promises us that we will change the world and yet by its very nature stops us from acting like human beings this is a very welcome respite” – steph

“I do it every time I go down there” – ian 

“Hopscotchhh!!” – logan

“Joyful screaming” – child

I agree. MIT is psets and club meetings and emails and midterms that never abate. Sometimes you have to go robot mode to stay afloat. But then again, sometimes there’s hopscotch!!! <3","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/dormspam-1000x469.png

Saturday Night in Simmons,Kayode D. '27,5,2024-12-15T00:00:00-05:00,"Y’all.

Simmons is bustling tonight. I realized while going to get new shoes for Gatas [explained below] that this would make a great blog post! So I went to snatch my friend, Caleb M. ’27 ‘s camera, and here are the pics I took over like and hour or something, running around Simmons and seeing who’s who in this crazy zoo.

Christmas Party:

Tonight my friend group did secret santa. It was very much fun indeed!

The Lobby:

 

Simmons Hallway Mural:

I ran into Summer and Maria putting up a new chalk mural in the main stairway in the lobby. So much talent! These guys are responsible for so many amazing chalk murals in Simmons. Check out this crazy cool art blog from Andi Q ’25 for more!

 

MPR use tonight [VGO and Nicki]

This would have been a cool shot, but I got all distracted and missed it :[] My keyboard STILL doesn’t work with the number keys, so i’ve been using emoticons with the brackets a lot : ]

Here’s VGO’s performance from tonight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmQ3P6CnH6Y

They’re really good!

GATAS [aka the most fun game in Simmons]

After the Secret Santa, we played a game called Gatas, which i think means “Cats” in Spanish, but do NOT quote me on that.

Gatas is a really run game that we play on our now partially destroyed pool table above the Simmons lobby. I would explain the rules but I’m really tired. Maybe tommorrow I’ll update? You only need two balls and enough space to run around. And some good shoes you can hard brake in. I wore the wrong shoes.

4AB Lounge Happenings:

I had a friend the other day–who, mind you, I have done a pset all nighter most weeks this semester with [EVERY WEEK we say we won’t ever wait this late again to do 18.03, and then EVERY WEEK on Thursday we are like “guys… we did it again” and stay up all night again.] said that she has NEVER ONCE seen me locked in. And I wanted to argue with her, but I’m literally writing this blog instead of sleeping or studying. I do actually need to lock in for my two finals next week. Eeps!

The catch-all carousel of photos idk where to put:

Ok, I think I need to go to bed now.

wait… that’s not quite right…

Uhh, the weekend before EA decisions release!

hmm… not that either…

I meant, it’s time for the annual Blogger Wrapped, where we expose our music tastes for the internet to judge (and help you take a break from thinking about those previous two things)!

The other bloggers were kind enough to let me make this post this year. Probably because this year’s Spotify Wrapped content is somewhat… lacking in substance (what is Spotify Wrapped if I can’t find out which random European town matches my music taste 😔). But Gangnam Style is finally not one of my top five songs this year, so I’m at least happy about that.

Here are the previous editions of Blogger Wrapped if you’re interested: 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018.

But without further ado…

In 2024, the MIT Admissions bloggers listened to 686,742 minutes of music on Spotify, Apple Music, and *checks notes* YouTube Music. For reference, there are 525,600 minutes in a year.

Congratulations to Angie and Janet for being our most avid listeners this year, with 89,029 minutes and 86,156 minutes respectively on Spotify (about 2 months nonstop each)! On the other end of the spectrum, we have Allison and Emiko (the two non-Spotify bloggers who filled out this part of my survey) with 13,471 minutes and 20,629 minutes respectively – no doubt a result of their cursed non-Spotify platforms.

Ella didn’t even fill out my survey because she uses Apple Music too 😔

Just like last year, Gloria put us all to shame in the number of songs she listened to, with over 1.5x more unique songs than the next highest person (me). And it looks like even though Emiko didn’t spend much time listening to music, she listened to a diverse range of songs.



But when comparing the number of artists we listened to, I managed to pull slightly ahead of Gloria. It’s probably because I mostly listen to orchestral music, and Spotify often lists at least three different artists for those pieces.



Unsurprisingly, Angie once again tops the rankings for the most minutes spent listening to a single artist, with an impressive 132-day listening streak for The Smiths. That’s almost 7x longer than the next longest streak: Aiden’s 19-day listening streak for Taylor Swift! Veronica also makes a surprise appearance near the top of the rankings here, even though Apple Music apparently stops collecting data near October.

What makes you say that, Angie?

Specific top artists for each blogger:

- Angie: The Smiths (top 0.005% fan)

- Veronica: Taylor Swift (Apple Music does not report top % 🤡)

- Andi: Leonard Bernstein (top 0.001% fan)

- Janet: Zeph (top 0.005% fan)

- Aiden: Taylor Swift (top 2% fan)

- Jebby: Childish Gambino (top 0.1% fan)

- Uzay: Elliot Smith (top 1% fan)

- Emiko: Noah Kahan (Apple Music does not report top % 🤡)

- Allison: Lin Manuel Miranda (top 2% fan but on YouTube Music so…)

Moving on to top songs, Jebby easily takes the crown here with 503 streams of Lithonia by Childish Gambino. Angie said she fell asleep to No. 1 Party Anthem playing on repeat twice, but even that was not enough to place her in the top three. (Surprisingly, No. 1 Party Anthem is not a song by The Smiths! Scandalous, I know…)



Specific top songs for each blogger:

- Jebby: Lithonia by Childish Gambino (top 0.001% fan)

- Janet: miss me by Zeph (top 0.001% fan)

- Kano: An Unhealthy Obsession by The Blake Robinson Synthetic Orchestra (top 0.005% fan)

- Kai: do or die by aldn & carolesdaughter (top 0.01% fan)

- Ellie: Meteor Shower by Cavetown (top 0.01% fan)

- Kayode: Friend of God by Israel Houghton (top 0.005% fan)

        (top 0.005% fan)
      


- Petey: Euphoria by Kendrick Lamar (top 0.05% fan)

- Aiden: Skinny by Billie Eilish (top 0.05% fan)

- Uzay: Ferrari by Alice Gas (top 0.05% fan)

- Allison: Dead Mom from Beetlejuice (YouTube Music does not report top %)

Fun fact: Birds of a Feather by Billie Eilish was the song that appeared most in the bloggers’ top-five lists. It features in Aiden’s, Kai’s, Veronica’s, and Kano’s lists.

Shout out to Kano for spending almost 20 hours one day listening to Spotify. Hang in there – the semester is almost over.

So true Petey

a blog from the universe,Veronica P. '27,1,2024-12-14T00:00:00-05:00,"Finals season is well and officially upon us, but I couldn’t help but feel the itch to blog. So, I turned to the world’s best enabler- a coin flip- because who can argue against the will of the universe?

heads– write this blog

tails- continue locking into 2.003

the universe (Siri) has spoken!



Recently, I had a person ask me: “you know it’s bad luck to be superstitious, right?” Which is really funny only because it accomplished his intention of making me, the superstitious person, look ridiculous when I replied- “really?!”

Gullibility aside, however, I think things like magic 8 ball outcomes and tarot card readings can be really helpful to encourage reflection. All the material is there- how you feel about your life, what decision your gut really wants to make- but practices like these help draw them out to the surface; the whimsy of it all only adds to the appeal.

So— in keeping with the theme while also in the interest of not entirely derailing my finals schedule— I’m going to pull one tarot card to prompt my blog writing today:

Tarot 101

Before we start interpreting, here’s my general understanding of how to approach tarot. I’m going to model this with my own interpretation, but I encourage you to try it out yourself as well:

- Try and get a good grasp of what the card is saying

- Ask yourself if the message hits home in any aspect of your life- it could resonate in more ways than one. Be creative- this deck was designed to be universal enough that there’s almost always some interpretation that lands.

- If it does, consider the advice provided by the cards- whether or not you take it is up to you

My Card: The Eight of Cups

here’s a digital image of what my card looks like!

Something I love about my tarot deck is how the artwork really tells the story, which I’ll try to paraphrase now:

At this point in the journey, the nymph feels dissatisfied with her ‘lukewarm’ life, and has decided that she needs to reunite with her wood elf, whatever it takes. Thus, she bravely sets off into the woods alone, where she befriends a dragonfly that offers to help her on her quest.

At this point in the journey, the nymph feels dissatisfied with her ‘lukewarm’ life, and has decided that she needs to reunite with her wood elf, whatever it takes. Thus, she bravely sets off into the woods alone, where she befriends a dragonfly that offers to help her on her quest.

To me, this card pinpoints that familiar rut many of us tend to fall into- that moment where life doesn’t seem quite as exciting or fulfilling as it once was. The key to escaping this, the card ventures, is to reflect on what exactly it is that you desire- those wants in the back of your mind that always seem to elude you. After this round of soul searching, it’s time to change course, to take the necessary steps to get you there. It may not be the easy choice, but it’s a lot better than wondering ‘what if?’

My personal card-induced reflection/ramble:

Immediately, the notion of a ‘lukewarm life’ jumped out at me. As a freshman, I found that my life often felt filled to the brim with novelty and uncertainty. Everything was a learning experience; the world had just opened up for me in a big way, a treasure trove of shiny new things to explore. As a sophomore, I can’t help feeling like my world is smaller again; I’ve already strolled down that path, and I’ve realized what lies there wasn’t for me- often, coming to that realization was painful. What once was viable, uncharted territory is now lost. Sure, I know my way around better, but I feel more jaded. It doesn’t make much sense to go exploring even further when I’ve found plenty of perfectly nice places to settle.

Talking with other college sophomores, I’ve found that a lot of them share this sentiment. Talking with juniors and seniors, it’s as if I’ve finally learned the language they’ve all been speaking, stripped of my ‘freshman-ness’ and now able to join the club.

It’s not that the novelty is completely gone- it’s just that it now takes a lot more effort to access; it seems less worth it to try and tap into. We have roots in places that need tending. Often, it’s more rewarding to nurture and appreciate what we know. Sure, the loss feels fresh now- but with time, surely I’ll be assured that settling was the right choice, won’t I?

Perhaps I’ve overly abstracted this with the metaphor- but it feels like it applies to so many aspects of my life: the major I’m pursuing, the extracurriculars I’m involved in, the communities I spend my time in, the people I interact with. On paper, I’m at a place in my life that should feel fulfilling and right, finally with enough footing to start building towards something. But every weekday comes with a giant to-do list, in my face and obscuring my vision from anything beyond the immediate demands- turning in my problem sets, meeting my research deliverables, organizing my floor’s next event, completing the next application. By the time that weekend rolls around, I’m so exhausted by my week that I frantically indulge in whatever provides the most immediate relief- whether it’s going out with friends or binging a show or spending too much money on Newbury Street. At MIT, ‘work hard play hard’ is the norm, oscillating between extremes. Ultimately, it’s as if my net displacement is zero- I’m not really going anywhere, but I’m still constantly moving.

So, when I got this card, I immediately resonated with the sentiment of stagnancy and dissatisfaction. But then, it was almost as if my tarot book was mocking me. “You know what you need to do,” it asserted, when I most definitely do not. When you perpetually feel at risk of falling behind, it’s hard to convince yourself that it’s worth it to stop and gather your bearings.

But I suppose I can buy into the notion that somewhere, in some crevice of my brain, lies that intuition. So, post finals hectic-ness, I’m going to try and set an appointment or three with my journal and see if I can find it out.

Final Thoughts

Honestly, after pulling this card I hesitated on whether I would post this blog at all. My interpretation feels incomplete, lacking a concrete resolution. At the very least, however, it’s motivating to consider the idea that you’re the one in control of your life. If you feel unsatisfied, you have the instinct within you to pinpoint exactly why— and the ability to follow up that discovery with action.

Besides, the universe told me to write this blog, so I suppose I have to listen.

 

p.s. to any prospective applicants: i swear i didn’t rig this tarot reading to encourage you to apply to MIT, but if that’s what your gut really wants- be brave <3","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5779-1-400x297.jpeg

A Fireside Chat with President Sally Kornbluth,Emiko P. '25,2,2024-12-13T00:00:00-05:00,"Did you know that President Sally Kornbluth, MIT’s 18th president, has sung onstage with one of MIT’s student acapella groups called the Chorallaries? Did you know that she is a foodie and loves to try new restaurants in Cambridge and Boston? Did you know that she does needlepoint portraits of dogs? Did you know that she loves folk music, her family and friends, and political drama TV shows?

I didn’t know any of this. 

In fact, I knew next to nothing about our newly inducted president until I sat with her face-to-face in her office to get to know her better. Her office was everything you’d expect the President of MIT’s office to be – dark wood panels lined the walls, a grand desk stood proudly in front of a wall of books, a sweeping view of MIT’s main courtyard could be seen from the windows, and the President herself smiled warmly at me behind a pair of teal glasses. 

Almost two years ago, President Sally Kornbluth succeeded former President Rafael Reif as the 18th MIT President. We may recognize her face and her title, but what is the President of MIT like on a personal level? Well, let’s find out.

What is something that you love about MIT?

“Every day you hear something unbelievable,” President Kornbluth says about her daily life at MIT. She loves that you can get a daily fix of science because you are surrounded by such amazing people and endeavors. She is proud of MIT and how it can provide real solutions to society’s problems. 

She loves the entrepreneurial spirit, too. “How many friends of yours have started companies?” she asks me. Immediately, half a dozen people spring to mind, and I laugh and tell her, “A lot.” We share a smile because we both know that this drive to learn and create is something uniquely special about MIT. 

What are some other things that you love? 

It seems that this may be the easiest question of all for President Kornbluth to answer. She loves her friends and family, exploring area restaurants, hiking on trails like the Minuteman Trail, and exploring new countries (like when she went to Iceland last summer!). She loves the rejuvenating feeling of nature, and she loves traveling in order to immerse herself in completely new cultures and environments. It seems to me that she is kind of like an anthropologist of new people and experiences, carefully collecting them and expanding her knowledge of the world. I tell her this, and she says, “You have to be curious. If not, things would be a lot more dull.”

Do you have any nerdy interests?

MIT is known for its nerdy interests – and our president is no different. “I’m definitely nerdy. I like to read books on anything. Also over the pandemic, I got super into needlepoint, which I know sounds super funny,” President Kornbluth tells me. I have to agree, that does sound pretty funny. She then explains how, as a dog lover at heart, she has gotten into the hobby of doing needlepoint portraits of people’s dogs! 

She then goes on to say, “But I’m not really mechanically adept. I’m really wanting to learn those skills!” 

And then something occurred to me: “Wait, are you allowed to take classes?”

“Well, I could if I had the time!” she says with a laugh. And with that, we commence a brainstorming session on what classes President Kornbluth should take next semester. 

Tell me about your passions.

President Kornbluth trained as a cancer biologist, which has led her to be passionate about the life sciences. She tells me about the new MIT Health and Life Sciences Collaborative, which is seeding high-impact collaborations and interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences at MIT. She noted a launch event was in the works that would include faculty talks from MIT’s cast of luminaries… which actually took place last week (you can watch it here!)

Another passion of hers is climate. Although she has no trained expertise in the subject, her passion for climate and her belief that climate change is one of the greatest issues of our day has led her to pioneer the Climate Project at MIT. The goal of this project is to figure out how to get people at MIT – all working on their own brilliant projects separately – to row in the same direction. People and projects can be grouped into missions, such as “Building and Adapting Healthy, Resilient Cities” or “Restoring the Atmosphere, Protecting the Land and Oceans.” This subject captured her imagination as a pressing problem that MIT can actually approach, especially because she was looking for ways that MIT’s deep knowledge could underpin actual policy recommendations. 

Another project is called 
        MITHIC
      
, which is a platform for collaboration between the SHASS and departments in MIT’s other schools and the college. MITHIC will include seed money for projects, educational initiatives, undergraduate research opportunities, and postdoc fellowships. Examples of funds include the SHASS+ Connectivity Fund and the Humanities Cultivation Fund. 

The spirit of MIT has always been mens et manus: mind and hand. It is a message stating that we don’t only solve problems on paper – we turn them into reality. This philosophy really shines in all of these new projects spearheaded by President Kornbluth, and it makes me excited to see our president taking the initiative to create programs that will use the minds of MIT to better our world.

What do you have to say to people who are reading the blogs and applying to MIT?

“It’s cool to be curious here! It’s cool to start companies and to take hard classes,” she says. “Also, it’s not what we know – it’s how we know it. The elegance of science is something to be admired. If you’re curious to know something, MIT will give you the tools to figure it out.” President Kornbluth’s personal curiosity aligns well with MIT’s own intrinsic curiosity. That’s why she created her own podcast called Curiosity Unbounded, where she and special guests discuss everything from evolution to literature to 4D printing.  

She also emphasizes how amazingly collaborative MIT is. President Kornbluth tells me about how she recently visited and had dinner at Phi Beta Epsilon, one of MIT’s fraternities on campus, and was struck by the camaraderie and cooperativeness of the students in the fraternity. She tells me that it gives her hope that we have a whole generation of students moving society forward with a can-do attitude. She says, “It’s a hopeful act to be taking action.”

President Sally Kornbluth made quite the impression on me. Her joy for learning, for the surprise and delight that the discovery of new knowledge provides, reminds me a lot of the students here at MIT. She always seeks to grow – even in areas she is not an expert in. She is an example of a life-long learner, of being adaptable and excited when confronted with unfamiliar situations, of finding joy and purpose in the pursuit of the betterment of society. 

She also wants to be involved in students’ lives. I don’t think it’s very common for a student like me to be able to email their university President, casually request an interview, and then get a response the very next day with an enthusiastic of course! That’s pretty cool, if you ask me.

I hope reading this has helped our president become a more familiar face. Next time you see President Kornbluth walking through the halls, maybe you will wave hello, or ask for a restaurant recommendation, or 
        commission a needlepoint portrait of your dog.
      
 Or maybe you will make sure to catch her next acapella performance.

Thanks for chatting, President Kornbluth! See you around campus :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/iceland-3.jpg

DO YOU WANNA BUILD A SNOWMAN??,Allison E. '27,2,2024-12-13T00:00:00-05:00,"RAHHHH IT SNOWED AGAIN!!!

As the blogs’ resident snow enthusiast, I consider it my sacred duty to announce the 
        FIRST(ish)
      
 SNOW OF THE YEAR!! (several days late)

We’ve been getting occasional “it MiGhT snow… mAyBe” messages from the cryptic weather machine, and even got a very melty dusting a couple days ago. Fortunately, however, snow with staying power chose a weekend to finally arrive :D

Even more ironically, the snow chose to arrive during the middle of 
        B2
      
’s notably tropical-themed floormal party. With a giant beach poster covering one wall, tropical imagery displayed on the TV, a large quantity of fake lei, and half the attendees dressed in shorts and aloha shirts, we were… rather ill-prepared for the snowfall.

Nevertheless, we persevered!! In whatever combination of short sleeves, short shorts, and open-toed shoes, we streamed outside, caught snowflakes in our mouths, threw some snowballs at each other, and quickly scurried back into the warmth of the dorm.

But of course, the story doesn’t end here. As snow began to actually build up on the sidewalk, I went to find some of my friends upstairs, changed into more cold-appropriate clothes, and we went outside!!!





 

Of course, I had to make an obligatory snow angel:

once again, insults aimed at my snow angel will not be permitted

By this time, it was 1:30 am, and we had work to do. But sometimes, side quests must be sidequested: it was time to build a snowman.

Now, as you probably noticed, there really wasn’t that much snow on the ground. Luckily, the snow was 
        sticky
      
, and Ojas G. ’27 and I were persistent. Starting from small seeds, we systematically cleared several sidewalk sections to create our snowballs. We stacked the balls, reinforced the connection points, collected two arm sticks, retrieved one of the B2 fake lei, poked holes in the head for sunglasses, and used two Hershey’s kisses donated by passerbys as buttons. We added a sign for the final touch, and…

BEHOLD! THE SNOWMAN!!!





Anyways, that took an hour and a half, and we had to get back to work, so we went back inside and psetted until various times (between 5:00 am and 10:00 am). The final stretch before the semester ends can do… things… to your sleep schedule. Also it was the weekend, and as Ojas noted, “the time spent building the snowman has come directly out of my sleep and potentially my grades but it was 100% worth it.”

The next day was, unfortunately, quite warm (high of 48F), and when I left our dorm that morning, our poor snowman had not fared well… His death will be avenged, the next time it snows >:(

"MIT EA Decisions to be Posted Tuesday, 12/17/24, at 6:28 PM ET",Ceri R. '16,63,2024-12-10T00:00:00-05:00,"Sometimes I feel like an alien because 
        I don’t really listen to music.
      
 So I asked hyperlocal radio personality Kayode D. ’27 to curate 
        a playlist with good vibes
      
 so I don’t show up to the blogs empty-handed while announcing that Early Action decisions for the Class of 2029 will be released next Tuesday, 12/17/2024, at 6:28 PM ET. 

To check your decision on the 17th, visit apply.mitadmissions.org/apply and go to your Application Status Page. That’s the same place that you’ve been tracking your application checklist, which will now be turned off. Your decision will be awaiting you there, behind a button that says “View Update.” 
        Make sure that you are ready to receive your decision, whatever it may be, before you press that button.
      


In order to help logistically prepare yourself, I recommend you practice logging in now so you don’t run into any issues next Tuesday. If you need to reset your password, just go to apply.mitadmissions.org/apply, click the link to Log In, then click “Forgot Your Password?” and follow the instructions. If you still need help after that, feel free to email admissions@mit.edu and someone from our team will get back to you!

Admissions decisions will be available exclusively online. Decisions will not be released via email, skywriting, snail telegraph, carrier pigeon, balloon mail, or intergalactic radio broadcast. However, we will be sending admitted students additional, cylindrical information in the near future.

Until then, remember to do things that remind you that you are, in fact, human. Take a couple deep breaths—of outside air if you can, whether it’s crisp or muggy or in between. Create something silly with or for your friends. Watch something that makes you stop and think “wow, the world we live in is freakin’ wild and I am so lucky to be here.”

And when it comes time for Early Action decisions, we’ll be here on these blogs with some open threads for you to chat with people who are going through very similar emotional rollercoasters, or admissions officers and bloggers who have had their own ups and downs. You don’t have to be alone if you don’t want to be.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryRcPeOM1sY,1
[joint liveblog] finding the BALANCE with 2.009,Janet G. '27,10,2024-12-09T00:00:00-05:00,"A live DJ. 1000+ sparkly pompoms. One of the biggest events of the year. What more can you ask for?

Tonight is the 
         2.009 presentation.
      
 Kano’s blog gave you a sneak peek, Emiko’s blog will give you the comprehensive behind-the-scenes for the capstone projects themselves, and this blog is instead about the audience POV. In some lucky turn of events, Kayode D. ’27 and I managed to secure some last minute tickets (and extras!) which means that despite completely sleeping through ticket launch, I’m here to liveblog our reaction to the event. It’s my first time, the vibes are immaculate, and I’m SO excited.

(watch the livecast here if you want to join us for the ride!)


        No guarantees on photos for the rest of the night,
      
 but here’s a sneak preview while we’re waiting for the event to start:

Pre-show Performances

We just witnessed a performance from MIT Bhangra, one of the dance groups at MIT! Very nice!

[if you are reading this, then the photos we take are in a format that can’t be uploaded easily, and we will upload after the showcase! since no one will see this soon enough, i can say whatever i want to. amongus skibidi toilet. haha.]

(janet would like to clarify that she did NOT say that and kayode is the only one saying sk*bidi in the house)

the opening video was very lit. janet was very happy about the feature of the hackmit ’24 hacker hoodie (it is conveniently purple)

opening speech

it was very lit. they made maybe one too many balance puns, but the incredible opening video compensated for that i think

[we’ll maybe attach some photos later]

Chorallaries Performace

i think they played “tell me what you want”? [Janet knows nothing about music. it was… actually no that’s what it’s called.]

Kayode: “i don’t know what to say other than… very nice”

Janet: “well AKSHUALLY… ok idk what to say either. their harmonies are beautiful as usual!!”

red team presentation

the stage and emcees changed costumes very quickly all things considered

OMG Emiko P. ’25 is in this team!!! SLAYYYY

THEY BROUGHT A REAL FIREFIGHTER ON STAGE… KINDA COOL??

okAYYYYY vortex’s air filtration absolutely eats??? their air filtration is 200x cleaner than the outside air

*in a fancy voice* “very nice.” – Kayode

To summarize; Red Team made a product called Vortex, which is an alternative to current smoke filtration masks for wildfires. They are compact, durable, and resemble a bandana. While an N95 mask has a filtration score (number of particulates outside of mask / # inside of mask) of ~10, Vortex has a max score of 200!!! And the cost breakdown is nut too! It’s cheaper than anything on the market and there’s nothing quite like it out there. Sweet!

for the q&a section: there are people with LED encrusted top hats wandering around with box mics. only valid form of q&a already

Good job Emiko!

fixation performance

MY (janet’s) CHILD (victoria h. ’28) IS PERFORMING IN THIS. THAT’S ALL I WANNA SAY

they all have gloves like michael jackson. hee hee. – kayode

yellow team 

“HI KANO” – janet

holy sh*t the emcees actually came in on rollerskates. high effort presentations af

“engineering and design is not just about making cool things…” – kayode disagrees



kayode: I’m trying to pay attention but all I can think about is this knee surgery meme.

“40,000 knee surgeries per year. 800,000 knee surgery patients in the U.S.”

janet: i really want to ask a question because i want to speak with the magic box but my head is literally empty rn… also my voice is about to die it might be over

philippe petit

THE BALANCE PUNS MAKE A COMEBACK. with a vengeance (and THE tightrope walker, philippe petit??!!)

DUDE this guy came in on a unicycle. immediately says (paraphrased because i’m bad at remembering) “i don’t understand why people go around on bicycles. two wheels? what a waste”

THIS GUY IS SO FUNNY “i was not born in a circus so i had to learn” “… my illegal walk”

THIS GUY BROUGHT OUT THE JUGGLING PINS THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD

“I MISSED IT” – notable screenager kayode putting his head in his hands

HE’S GONNA DO AN IMPOSSIBLE MOVE !!! “once i do this i hope you guys are gonna scream like crazy”

“that was a quarter and a half of a second”… the suspense..

HE DID IT

“bro was stood on business” – kayode

the chorollaries make a return

SEA SHANTY MENTION

*neural activation*

Did you know that the wellerman is not actually a sea shanty? It was written in the 1950s about the New Zealand Whale hunters of the 1850s. So it’s more of a focsle (folk-sea) song than anything else. the curse of shanty knowledge. it also doesn’t follow typical sea shanty capstan or hauling structure, but i digress. i didn’t come here to talk about shanties.

🤓 👆 – janet [actually shut up. – kayode]

(nah this is pretty impressive and did you know he took a sea shanties class AND ALSO NEW ZEALAND FEATURE !!)

“..AND THE WHALE”S NOT GONE”

blue team presentation

SALLY FEATURE

“sorry guys would’ve loved to be there but i’m in sweden with our nobel laureates… sorry babes xx” (paraphrased) this woman is so funny

THIS GUY IS A LOBTSER OH MY GOD THEY BROUGHT A LOBSTER

the balance jokes have been replaced with sea puns… what if we SEA SOMETHING DIFFERENT [that was pretty bad…] [bro kayode you’re SO MEAN WHAT THE HELL ur literally charging ur phone on MY laptop bro]

“that man is TALL” – kayode, a notable 6 foot guy himself

damn i didn’t realise that lobsterman is an actual title… kinda cool

guys kayode is about to leave soon which means that i get to say what i want bYEEEE

this feels targeted. I have band practice for Cru. Literally doing the Lord’s work out here smh my head.

good presentation!! This blog will need to be heavily grammar checked later on. It’s been real, y’all. But not that real. See ya next time.

kayode was ejected.

kayode was not the imposter.

one imposter remains.

green team presentation

the cheers backstage is SENDING ME like yes queens support your team !!

“turns your entire skull into a speaker” *friends next to me gulp* “guys… do we actually want that”

ok i feel like i should kinda get back on track so basically this is a pressure resistant deep sea communication device so that scuba divers can talk to each other clearly and easily

“what’s been ur fav part” *collective awww* “THE INSTRUCTORS ARE COOL”

we made things and want to show them to you,Kanokwan T. '26,1,2024-12-09T00:00:00-05:00,"Tonight, mechanical engineering seniors will showcase the culmination of 3.5 years of hard work in our 2.009 Product Engineering Process Final Presentation. Everything you need to know lives on this site.

Around 100 students, 1 semester, 6 incredible products—all packed into 2 hours. You ready?


        If you weren’t able to secure a ticket—worry not:
      
 there’s a webcast. There’s also an awesome accompanying liveblog by Janet G. ’27 and Kayode D. ’27, who are posting their live reactions to the whole event.

P.S. I’m on Team Yellow!

On the team, 
        I was elected to serve as one of the System Integrators,
      
 which was a lot of work, but so worth it. I can’t wait for you to see what we’ve created. We’re so hyped. Just look at us:

Funny story

It feels like destiny that I ended up on Team Yellow. I was born on a Monday, and in Thai culture, Monday is associated with the color yellow/gold. My name, Kanokwan, means “girl of gold.” If you ever meet another Kanokwan, you can bet she’s a Thai woman born on a Monday! There are a few of us out there. And, as if that wasn’t enough, my last name means “to start and run a successful, developing business.” How poetic.

Another funny story

This year’s theme is balance. Ironically, because of my brain injury, I’ve had balance issues and now go to vestibular physical therapy. And—here’s the kicker—my team’s product is a physical therapy device! The coincidences this semester have been unreal.

Aiden Wrapped,Aiden H. '28,12,2024-12-03T00:00:00-05:00,"It’s December, which means it is time to (drumroll please)…

 

🎉🎉HAVE AN MINOR EXISTENTIAL CRISIS BECAUSE SOMEHOW 11 MONTHS HAVE PASSED (cue airhorn noise)🎉🎉

 

As someone who loves to obsess over random, 
        useless statistics,
      
 I am naturally the friend that will always send you my top-ten everything of the year completely unsolicited. TierMaker is my best friend, I use a Tumblr Song Sorter after every major album release, and everything in my mind exists in a battle-to-the-death style list of what’s better (kind of like the Challenge Towers from Mortal Kombat). Now that I have a minor platform, I finally have a place to share my awful opinions and create my own war in the comments.

My biggest issue with “end-of-year” rankings, though, is that every major magazine/newspaper always releases them at the beginning of December, so we always forget about everything important that happens in December. But, I refuse to break a trend and naturally will enforce this delusion that December has no important pop culture.

So without further 
        ado,
      
 here are my most important rankings of 2024-things.

 

Movies

I simultaneously love going to the movies and also rarely go. Part of that is the curse of streaming has become as destructive as ever, turning every movie that could be good in the theater into a god-forsaken “Netflix Original”. I just hate streaming movies if it’s my first time watching it, since streaming gives more of a mindless, I’m-just-gonna-put-this-one-while-I-pset kind of vibe, which inevitably leads to me watching the same things over and over and only being exposed to new movies when one reasonably good one comes out every 6 months. This sadly means that of the movies I did go see, I only really liked 4. Nonetheless, here are the best movies I saw in the theater that came out this year.

- Dune 2 – Life-altering, mind-shattering, transformative, beautiful, perfect, etc. Saw it twice in IMAX, have watched it two or three more times on Max, and I will continue to have this as the best sci-fi/fantasy movie I’ve ever seen. (…also it was Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet so duh).

- 
        Wicked
      
 – Yes it has not even been out for two weeks, but I have already seen the movie multiple times in theaters. A lot of people are saying this movie is disappointing?? And to that I say you set your expectations wayyyy too high because I feel like there is nothing else, much less nothing better, that this movie could have done. I don’t think it’s my favorite movie of all time, but it is my current obsession, especially as someone who hasn’t seen Wicked on stage and was largely introduced to it through the movie.

- Challengers – Zendaya strikes again!!! Naturally, as a Luca Guadagnino movie, I was going to love this, but then he dared to make it about professional tennis (which I am already randomly obsessed with despite never having played). We all heard the soundtrack. We all saw the tennis-ball-as-the-camera shot. We all saw them violate that churro. We all watched the edits to Brat by Charli XCX playing over the final game. Moving on.

- Fall Guy – I made my friend randomly go see this with me one day after it came out and it was a good time. Nothing crazy spectacular, but I could rewatch it in bed as a comfort movie down the line.

Movies that were bad: Despicable Me 4, Inside Out 2, Mean Girls, A Family Affair

Movies I still need to watch: My Old Ass, Saturday Night, We Live In Time, Blink Twice, Anora

Movies I (probably) won’t watch: Moana 2, Gladiator II, It Ends With Us, Twisters

 

The hard part with music rankings is always that the length of projects and when they were released in the year affects everything so drastically. Sure, I might have listened to the Taylor Swift album “more”, but that’s because Taylor’s album is 30 songs while Billie’s only has 10. Also, Taylor, Beyonce, Billie, and Charli all came out in the spring, while Chromakopia (or even GNX by Kendrick) came out so recently that I feel like I can’t rank it higher than these other albums I obsessed over, even though I might actually like them more. Finally, the amount of music I listen to that came out before this year would throw off this chart entirely.

Nonetheless, 
        consider these 10 the majority of the music I was listening to.
      


- Hit Me Hard and Soft – Billie Eilish

- Brat (including all remixes) – Charli XCX

- Charm – Clairo

- Cowboy Carter – Beyonce

- Eternal Sunshine – Ariana Grande

- The Tortured Poets Department 
        (including The Anthology)
      
 – Taylor Swift

- Chromakopia – Tyler, the Creator

- All Born Screaming – St. Vincent

- Wall of Eyes – The Smile

- Romance – Fontaines DC

Concerts I went to: Bad Bunny (Denver/Ball Arena), The Head and the Heart (Morrison/Red Rocks), Clairo (Boston/Roadrunner)

 

Books

I’ve said this for a couple of years now, but I will be reading more in 2025. In middle school and over COVID I was such a huge reader, but then I joined the debate team and AP classes in high school and my leisurely reading never returned.

I used to be so cracked 😭😭😭

I did read 
        more than three books
      
 this year, but these three were the only ones I really liked/read in a normal amount of time/would broadly recommend.

- Intermezzo by Sally Rooney – Officially the “hot girl autumn” book of the year, this is the only book I’ve read this semester, but wow the amount I fully, publicly cried at the airport speed-reading the ending. I’ve read every Sally Rooney book but only really loved Normal People, but this definitely had a very intense, poetic nature that feels more like ~literature~ than a lot of other books I’ve read in the past few years.

- The Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee – I got this from a Barnes and Noble in Tempe, Arizona (more details to come) and read it on and off throughout the spring. It is a longggg book, but alongside my AP Bio class, it sparked a deeper interest in genetics and bio for me as a career path, so to that I owe it credit. Also the author writes the history of 1600s geneticists as if it’s really intense tea so that makes it more enjoyable than a typical (and tragically boring) science nonfiction book.

- My Body by Emily Ratajkowski – This is a collection of essays I got a couple years ago when it was published but only started reading it this summer when I was bored at work. A lot of people have come after the book as vapid and glamorizing a lot of modern female issues…but I feel like that’s the point? Not that EmRata wanted to spread any harm, but taking it as a peek into the perspective of a very successful model instead of a book of morals to follow made the essays an interesting insight into how every aspect of popular culture/fashion/beauty standards can be twisted to hurt anyone.

Places

This was a year of some pretty big travel for me as someone who is notably not a millionaire. I got to multiple cities outside of Colorado that I haven’t been to before, albeit mostly for academic reasons. Hopefully leisurely travel is in my future.

- New York City, New York – Concrete jungle, babyyy. I have wanted to go to New York my entire life, so going as my “senior trip” with my family was pretty perfect. Although doing all the touristy stuff, staying in Times Square, and the July heat wave made the trip pretty exhausting, the whole experience just confirmed my belief that I have to live there at some point. I also saw Aladdin (my favorite Disney movie) on Broadway, which was my first theater experience.

- Boston, Massachusetts (2nd Time) – Moving to Boston has been a great experience and I continue to enjoy the city despite dropping temperatures. A 9.9/10, but nothing can really beat New York.

- Washington, DC (Both Times) – I went to visit my girlfriend twice at GW, once in February and once in September. These weren’t my first times visiting DC, so it wasn’t a crazy new experience either time around, but we went to see the Clue musical at the Kennedy Center which was hilarious and a very cutesy vibe.

- Tempe, Arizona – I came here the first week of 2024 for a debate tournament at ASU with just my friend/debate partner and her mom. It was my second time in the Phoenix area (both times for debate), and I have always kind of liked the vibe? Also escaping Colorado’s winter was a nice getaway. However, the burnout from writing 
        all the college applications
      
 and senior year made us less than excited to prepare, so we went into the tournament with not a lot of prep and ended up doing verrrrry bad for our standards.

- Boston, Massachusetts (1st Time) – I hate to say it, but CPW was awful. I 
        stayed in a frat,
      
 was sick the whole time, and met no one I really clicked with. Boston was still peak though, and I got to see the Boston Marathon.

- Des Moines, Iowa – Hell on earth. I would say no offense to Iowans, but honestly there is some offense because what is going on here. I went for the National Speech and Debate tournament and stayed at a rural college dorm 45 minutes away from the city that was quite literally the most disgusting building I had ever been inside. Plus me and my partner did bad so there’s beef there, too! My team and coaches made up for the lackluster setting, but I’m only ranking places so….

2024 – Final Thoughts

This is the shortest year I feel like we’ve had in a while, probably because it feels like the first real year since COVID. I have felt pretty stuck since the pandemic, which is a common thing for a lot of people but I think especially Gen-Z. A lot of pretty formative years–AKA 13 through 17–were spent locked away in my room and doing nothing. A part of me has always felt like exactly the same person since I was 13 because no major life or personality changes have happened.

2024 feels like the first non-COVID/moving on/actually different year. Part of that is almost definitely moving to college, but also the vibes were just a lot more regular? 2024 definitely gives 2019 in the strongest way. Fortunately, I had no tragic life events or major upsets in my year, and a lot of it was smooth sailing, which allowed for it to feel very fast.

2025 doesn’t even sound like a year, so I have quite literally no idea what it holds (except for probably organic chemistry). We’ll see, I guess.

2024 is a solid 8/10.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-02-at-3.15.45%E2%80%AFPM-400x1100.png,1
what’s in the box?,Janet G. '27,1,2024-12-01T00:00:00-05:00,"today yesterday 
        thanksgiving was a few days ago, and in the world of this post it is still thanksgiving day,
      
 which means that it’s a particularly boring day for me. i woke up to grey skies and decided to go back to bed for another two hours. once i finally mustered up the willpower to get up, i found myself facing the once-in-a-blue-moon challenge: finding something to occupy myself with. 

my friend Espen S. ‘27 invents a lot of games. one of these we sometimes call the phrasing game: where you choose a Thing, and phrase it in the best and worst possible ways. an example could be my 
        6.1210
      
 problem set that was due last week: you could call it “an fun intellectual exercise which challenges your understanding of dynamic programming and pushes you to confidently write your own algorithms”, or you could call it “the fucker that kept me up until 4am and made me question all my life decisions that lead to me trying to debug the worst code i’ve written in my life.” hopefully you get the gist.

this game popped up in my head today as i was digging through the boxes under my bed. when you apply this game to “the way janet structures her room”, you could say that i’m a very sentimental person who treasures even the littlest things in life. you could also call me a messy hoarder. 

anyway— the point is mostly that i have a lot of random shit that i haven’t had the heart to throw out, and since today i really needed something to do, i decided to clean out some part of my room. 

there’s this one box in my room which you could call a fire hazard. it’s stuffed to the brim with papers: past exams, letter collections, posters and programs from events i’ve gone to in the past year or so. the exams were an easy go; the letters from my friends were an easy keep. the posters are awkward. they’re some schrodinger’s-marie-kondo-esque dilemma — i do not think about them very often, but every time i do, there’s some warmth of recalling the memories that come with them which makes me hesitant to throw them away. last year we put them on the wall, but this year our suite is shaped too awkwardly for me to plaster posters all over them again.

some of my hoard of posters on the wall last year!

today i’ve finally found a solution to this problem! i am going to inventory all of the posters and programs in this blog, and get paid to store my memories here instead of keeping the wad of awkward papers in my room. 

shows & performances

fall ’23

the boston ballet’s nutcracker was the first ever ballet i went to! Sophie L. ‘27 got her and me $15 tickets to the boston ballet (i think they have a student discount), and a whole bunch of us met up to go watch. it was really beautiful and i definitely felt very fancy, but i have to admit that i fell asleep halfway through the second act… it was still all very impressive though, would go again if i had time (unfortunately this year i probably don’t). pnr behaviour, etc. 

one of the first actual events in the year that i went to, back when i was a wide-eyed frosh who wanted to be 
        everything everywhere all at once.
      
 the EC community is one of those communities who i respect immensely, but unfortunately didn’t initially click and now i feel a little far from. hall rush was cool though, i really liked all of their rooms and talking to all the halls about their cultures. i learned dj-ing from putz briefly too which was cool :P i’ve forgotten all of it though 




        MITSO
      
 always has pretty good pieces. i honestly don’t remember much from this aside from the fact that i liked dvorak and may have fallen asleep during some of the variations…

i think this was the first acapella concert that i went to at mit? it was very sweet. the mit centrifugues also have a special place in my heart because i was briefly in it for two weeks at the start of freshman fall, and then dropped because i had too many commitments :’) i adore the mashups and the spinning arts guest feature was also really cute! 



so i have to confess that i only watched this over the livestream… i think someone else actually went and i was on my program collecting mode which is why i have this LOL. VGO has a really good set and there’s this one bit where the cellists spin their cellos for Rainbow Road, which i thought was very funny. wish i could’ve gone in person but we had VGO perform live for 
        Blueprint ‘24
      
 so that was also pretty good :P 



ADT might have been the first dance show i went to! the energy was really high for this show and i really liked most of the sets, and lots of my friends were performing so i took a lot of videos LOL 

my friend Sophie L. ’27 took a theatre class in fall ‘23 which had a final production. it was very experimental, which made it a little incomprehensible and confusing at times, but the different mediums made it really fascinating to watch. i think they broke a TV at some point and Audrey L. ‘27 has a video of Sophie throwing a big bouncy ball right at us (this was a part of the performance where the audience just threw around the yoga ball and people were singing an off-key version of taylor swift’s love story on the stage???) very much a fever dream, which seems on theme for my freshman fall. 



stupid f*cking bird: MIT 
        LOST’s 
      
 fall 23 play. i cannot understate how much i love LOST plays. they do a really good job of choosing great plays that i’ve never experienced before, and the marketing decisions for the play were very entertaining. i also met one of my friends Susan H. ‘27 from watching her perform here so that’s cool too :P 



so perhaps this is a screenshot of a poster rather than the real program. i kinda lost the real program oops but this was a very funny show of much ado about nothing by the MIT Shakespeare Ensemble! i went to support Claire W. ’27 who played an AWESOME cross-gender gay benedick, but also this play has a special place in my heart because i studied it in 
        year 12 english.
      
 such a funny play and one of my favs by far

spring ’24



dance troupe’s spring ’24 showcase! went to this to support my 
        hackmit grandbig
      
 Joyce Y. ‘24 <3 the contemp style was very cool and i liked the texas dance LOL i thought it was funny. unfortunately don’t remember much else. 



again, went to support friends in ADT (MIT Asian Dance Team) since a lot of friends were dancing. honestly i feel like i liked the dances less in spring vs. fall, but it might also just be that i’m more used to this style of dance performance lol. also i went in an earlier timeslot this year so the crowd had less energy for some reason

i loved the promo for juresopark (mit resonance’s spring 24 concert) — i believe the big inflatable dinos attacked one of my lectures at some point — and also the program was really funny. their skits were also hilarious and somehow had a pretty cohesive storyline that somewhat linked to the songs iirc? i also pulled up with a few friends so we had a pretty good time screaming for our friend Kat who was performing 

i loved remix! went during spring ‘24, it was so fun. i have a lot of friends in both MissBehaviour and MIT MoveMENTality, and they really ate. the energy of the crowd was impeccable, the guest performers were incredible, and even the breaks between songs had some of the most fun bits that i’ve seen. they worked very hard for it and it was a really good time :) 

Footwork XVII (MIT Ridonkulous’ annual dance showcase) was very fun. i really hadn’t seen so many dance groups in one sitting before this so it was very awe-inspiring LOL. there were quite a few technical difficulties on the day but in a way it really helped show how well the groups train — for one song the sound died out in the last minute and the group literally just continued by coordinated muscle memory, which both the crowd and i were very very impressed by. the wifi also died in kresge and they couldn’t get the soundtrack working for ages for another group ☠️but the group just went with it (shoutout MIT Bhangra for pushing through) and we had some fun improv instead 

summer ’24



bonus because technically not during the school year: the boston festival orchestra runs free events every summer, so a few friends and i popped down to one of the halls at the new england conservatory to the see them! thankful to Audrey and Phoenix for telling me about it – i really enjoyed their playing of scheherazarde, although have to admit that i dozed off again at some point… there’s really a theme with this. 



i also went to a storytelling circle with Nicole H. ‘27 when i visited her in pittsburgh over the summer. i really loved the cosiness of the space, and this was one of their little programs that they were running for the summer :) unfortunately i only stayed for 3 days so couldn’t actually experience the program for myself 

fall ’24



mit concert choir’s Fall ’24 performance! a few of my friends were performing here (this was also the day we did blogston commons, and i mentioned it briefly). 
        as per usual, i again crashed out for a little bit, 
      
but i did enjoy the soloists. opera singers have a very clear voice which is impressive and enjoyable in a way distinct from pop music, and i was in a anti-pop-music mood at the time so this was extra refreshing 




        mocha moves’
      
 annual dance competition! i loved the spooky theme this year and thought their pubbing posters were done very well. i unfortunately only pulled up for the half the time because i had to run to a friend’s halloween was yesterday party and i also had to review for exams the monday after. it was still very good though, and a particular shoutout to MMT’s mickey mouse set because it was the funniest set i’ve seen in a while. 

the pillowman!! very cool. another 
        LOST 
      
 production. my friend Tristan C. ‘27 was one of the leads so he told me about it a lot, and quite a few of my other friends were playing in it too so i kinda had to go. the play also made me cry a lot — martin mcdonough wrote an excellent play, which i thought the LOST group did justice to. i also completely did not expect the direction in which the play went, which was a welcome surprise, because i was really forced to engage with the play as as result. sometimes when i watch media i will have read the synopsis already (oops admitting to a cardinal sin right here), which helps me stand away from the play and examine the meta of it more rather than just feel the emotions in the story. maybe this is an admittance of being afraid to trust the author… anyway watching this play live made me appreciate the value of trusting the author LOL. i also really loved the little string detailing that tied together the book, and i thought the design choices of this program were incredibly clean. 

the missing few :(

i also went to catsymptones (mit asymptones’ spring 24 concert), MIT Live’s spring ’24 showcase, mulog (mit logarhythm’s fall 24 concert), and another two MIT symphony orchestra concerts but i can’t find the program for any of them :( they were all very cute though and all of them made me think a lot about performance and joy, which maybe i will write about another day 

misc events



i went to the simmons pre-christmas study break with Maggie L. ‘27 in fall ’23 which was very cute. personal favourite might have been the homemade waffles, but i also really liked the wild babies study break where i met one of the GRA’s pet snake who was very cute!! we don’t have wild snakes in new zealand so this was pretty new to me



i remember going to this event in Spring ’24 and browsing a lot but not really buying anything; a win for my wallet, but not a permanent fix considering how much i was using retail therapy at the end of the semester as a coping mechanism 



udo is the 
        burton-conner area director,
      
 margaret’s dog. he is very cute. this was a very cute event. udo was wearing a cute hat and i ate popcorn and patted the dog. good event with good bois 



the classic ABC, one of two campus-wide parties hosted by B3rd. i actually don’t think i went because i was away on a retreat, but their postering is iconic (the orange paper, the variants of the acronym ABC) and we found it really funny that this was the acronym in our suite. 



me1tdown, another campus-wide party hosted by the b1ners. again very clean design decisions, i believe i pulled up for a while and jammed for a bit. very fun, i really liked their deco but don’t think i have a photo of it :( 



of course, i can’t miss our own campus-wide party. we held our inaugural one last year in celebration (protest?) of the 250th anniversary of the boston tea party, and held another one this year. our floor chairs carried it by doing the brunt of the planning and work, but overall it was very fun to help out with! last year i even invited my Real British Friend Ojas G. ‘27 who pulled up in his very british trenchcoat and all. two of my friends who shall remain anonymous also accidentally broke through the roof tile while starships was playing last year. this year we had a lot less chaos i think but also homemade boba that Alex Z. ‘28 spent 4 hours making, and it was DELICIOUS so i think if you’re on campus come fall ‘25 this will not be one to miss. 

these are technically not posters but it also turns out that i hoarded a number of lanyards too

ANYWAY thanks for coming along to my haul! stay tuned for the next edition as i reset my storage to make more posters for the next years :) 

(given how long this took maybe this is finally going to drive me towards a path of minimalism…)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image14-3-400x536.png

How to Build an LED Acrylic Sign,Richard O. '28,7,2024-11-30T00:00:00-05:00,"I absolutely love the design process. Everything from coming up with an idea to bringing it to life are things I don’t think I can ever get sick of. So when a discussion came up during a house meeting about things we could do to change up the Chocolate City lounge space, I absolutely jumped at the idea of creating a new sign for our wall.

 

For reference, the previous sign was a printed banner which to me felt pretty old-school and was asking to be improved.

Old Sign

 

So with that, the following instructions will teach you how to make your very own acrylic signage from scratch!

 

Step 1: Visualize the sign in your designated space

Alright so I’m not like a super cracked Autodesk user or anything but I do love using 
         Blender 
      
 for visualizing my ideas. So before even discussing it with the rest of our house, I ended up drafting what the sign would look like using some pictures of the wall and created different 3D versions of the sign on top of the pictures to see what people thought.

 

Now at first, I had drafted these concepts using inspo from this one YouTube video and thought that maybe a modern font would look a lot more sleek on our wall. But of course, sometimes the cooler designs aren’t the most feasible since some of the brothers pointed out that the wiring for LEDs between each letter for the modern fonts would end up being exposed since we, unfortunately, can’t drill holes for wires into our wall. So thus the original cursive script font that I found by using whatthefont on our banner became the set style for the project.

 

 

Step 2: Discuss, Collect Measurements, and Create Files

With the idea approved, it was now time to actually brainstorm all the logistics behind getting the sign up. So to do this we created a group chat and began talking about things ranging from materials, to hanging the signs to LED options, to maker spaces to work on it, etc.

 

Not the most sophisticated sketch but pretty much explains the process

 

Next step was to see all the different arrangements of the wording we could make on different-sized acrylic sheets that would allow us to save money while maintaining the original size of the font from the banner. We then also realized that some laser cutters would have sizing restrictions so we ended up just getting four 12×24 sheets to be on the safe side with the word “Chocolate” being split between two sheets.

 

Afterwards, it was time to turn the letters into a format that could actually be read by the laser cutters. So to do this, I went back to 
         Figma 
      
 to flatten the font so that instead of the words being treated like text, they would be treated like vector shapes. After flattening them, each of the letters became composed of line segments connected by individual points which you can see in the second picture and once I addressed some overlap issues, I then exported the words as SVG vector files and passed them along to my friend Ty who is a senior in the house that was more experienced in maker spaces than I was and helped convert those SVG files to DXF files more suitable for the cutter.

 

 

Step 3: Gather Your Ingredients

The following ingredients are specific to this recipe but can be adjusted accordingly for your own needs:

- four 24x12x(1/4) inch sheets of black glossy acrylic (Maybe 5-6 sheets if you follow step 6…)

- A buttload of command strips

- Epoxy packets

- 32FT of undiffused LED strips prior to step 6

- 32FT of much cooler, much more expensive diffused LED strips post step 6

- 1/2″ wooden square dowels

- A 60-70 watt Universal Systems Free Standing CO2 Laser Cutter (or something of the sort)

- Maybe a bandsaw if you wanna be fancy

- Pipe Cleaners

- Sand paper

- Clamps

- Cable covers that match your wall color (only if you can’t do wiring inside your walls)

- Scissors, pens, measuring tapes, and all the other basic stuff you might want

Step 4: Bake Your Acrylic in a 60 Watt Universal Systems Free Standing CO2 Laser Cutter

Laser cutters have to be the top 10 coolest things humans have ever built (the Colosseum would probably come in 11th place or something). Prior to this project I had never actually used one on my own but having both staff at the 
         EDS 
      
 maker space and a senior there that were willing to show me how to actually work one made the learning experience so much more fun. But like…you’re telling me a skinny automated lightsaber pretty much cut out these detailed shapes in like 2 minutes?

 

Anyways we started by lasering the “Choco” part and noticed that the cutter had offset the top of the letters from the bottom and started doing some weird stuff and not cutting right which led to us losing a sheet. But weirdly enough, one of the EDS staff who was helping us went into this back room of materials and walked out with the exact same sheet of glossy black acrylic we had been using in the exact same dimensions we had purchased and let us use it for free (absolute miracle). So before we tried again, we realized the alignment of the file on the bed was a little off and tested an adjustment to the cut with a piece of cardboard before using acrylic, and after some time we finally had the whole set cut out perfectly.

Also caught the sun perfectly aligned with a window while working on this and had to get a picture.

 

Step 5: Mix in the blocks for attaching to the wall and decorate with LEDS

With the acrylic cut, all that was left was to sand the back side, add some epoxy to hold wooden blocks that offset the sign from the wall, and attach the command strips that would keep the whole thing up to those blocks. Our initial plan was to cut a thinner version of the letters from a sheet of wood that we could glue to the back to have the acrylic protrude from for the LEDs but we learned that the laser cutters couldn’t cut 1/2-inch wood sheets which was the thickness we needed to have the LEDs face out so we ended up just cutting square blocks and gluing them to the back along the letters. After attaching those blocks we then wrapped the strips along the edge so they would make the wall glow without actually being seen.

 

 

Now after we had the sign up…it was a nice moment you know…the idea had finally come alive on our wall. But me being the person I am, I knew the sign had so much more potential. My first issue came with the LEDs themselves…something about them being spotty just felt too tacky to me and didn’t match the vision of the sign I had in my mind. To add to that, because we started wrapping the LEDs from the “C” in chocolate, the wire to power them had to come out the side and just looked too obvious and less integrated. And when showing the sign to the rest of the house I accidentally dropped the “est.” which foreshadowed worse to come.

So after it hung up for like a day I was able to convince people that the overly price diffused LED strips would just make the whole thing so much better…and we bought them.

Once they arrived, all that was left was to remove the sign from the wall, replace the LEDs, measure out the cable covers, and put it right back up…right…

 

Step 6: COMPLETELY OPTIONAL – Accidentally drop the sign so part of it shatters forcing you to restart…

Wrong.

So basically once I got help taking the sign off, I started thinking about the best way to hide the wires and found that there was a pipe along the ceiling that I could hide the cables with if we wrapped the LED strip starting from the letter “i” in “City” (this will make more sense in a picture below). So with that, I wanted to measure how long we would need to cut the cable cover to hide the wire from the letter “i” up to the pipe at the ceiling. And of course, the best way to do that would be to put the word “City” back up and measure the distance from the top of the i to the ceiling…

But you see…sometimes I don’t really think things through because when I put the “City” up, I only pressed down on two of the top-most command strips to hold it up because in my head I thought: “Oh I don’t need to press it into all the command strips, this will only take three seconds and I’ll just take it right down”. And of course, gravity wasn’t on my side that day…

💔

So the City came crumbling down and had to be rebuilt.

So back to EDS I went carrying acrylic sheets to re-laser the City and made another cardboard cutout to test the laser before putting the acrylic in but also realized after making it that I could use that same cardboard to measure the cable cover length the second time without breaking any actual acrylic.

 

Step 7: Add your newly purchased diffused lights, adjust the wiring, and trust the process

Now was the time. The diffused lights were so much brighter, colorful, and…actually diffused and I couldn’t contain my excitement as I wrapped them for this newer version. The strip was also a lot thicker this time though, so I had to do some weird stuff with pipe cleaners and electrical tape to keep it in place…but you just have to trust the process…

 

 

 

Step 8: Put it up again and enjoy!

 

And nothing fully completes your finished acrylic sign more than a Christmas tree for the upcoming holiday season!

 

And there you have it, your very own acrylic sign! Make sure to store at room temperature and keep away from children.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4758-scaled.jpg

I love musicals!,Kanokwan T. '26,4,2024-11-29T00:00:00-05:00,"worry not: there are no Wicked spoilers in this blog



Last Friday, I saw Wicked on opening night with two friends (Caitlin O. ‘25 and Oris S. N. ‘23), and I went absolutely FERAL. I have been waiting for this film for 
        LITERALLY 10 YEARS.
      
 

 

I HAVE BEEN SIMMERING. BUZZING. WAITING ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. HEARING GLIMMERS OF NEWS EVERY NOW AND THEN OVER THE YEARS, BUT NOT LETTING MYSELF GET TOO EXCITED UNTIL THE OFFICIAL OFFICIAL THING WAS OFFICIALIZED. 
        AND THE THING HAS FIIIIIINNNNNNALLLLY COME OUT!!!
      


 

Here’s some fun Kano-lore: Wicked was my gateway musical. A decade ago, my friend Adrien V. V. ‘24 told me I should go, and I did—completely cold. I went in only knowing that the name of the musical was Wicked. My god. I remember feeling so entranced and transported. The opening monkey scene lives in my brain rent free. I became so horribly obsessed.

My family saw Wicked at the Las Vegas Smith Center on November 4th, 2014.

I’m writing this blog from my childhood bedroom, BLASTING the entire Wicked soundtrack with my THX speakers cranked up to MAX bass. I am AMPED.

Anyways. Having seen Wicked, I’ve been inspired to finally get to a blog that I’ve been meaning to write for a long time…



MY LOVE LETTER TO MUSICAL THEATRE

 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

 

okay 
        let’s calm down a little bit
      


and establish clear definitions

- a show tune is a song from a musical

- a musical is a type of theater production that blends music, dance, and dialogue to tell a story

- a theatre production is… y’know

 

THE UNVEILED HUMAN EXPERIENCE

 

There’s something extraordinary about show tunes: they take the innermost thoughts you never dared to share and suddenly bring them to life on stage. It’s as if someone pressed pause on the world to let the emotions and struggles of a character explode into song and dance. Show tunes bring the most internal (feelings and thoughts) to the most external (the stage).

But it’s not just a song or a play—it’s the synthesis that makes musicals distinct. Music gives raw emotion a language that words alone can’t convey, while the theatrical staging grounds it in a world that feels alive and immediate. This fusion taps into something deeply primal: melding melody, movement, and meaning into a single, powerful expression. A play can draw you in with its dialogue, and a song can move you with its melody, but a musical immerses you completely, making you live every high and low as if they were your own.

 

THE COMMUNITY CONNECTION

 

More broadly, experiences that immerse people in shared storytelling—like live music, watching a movie, seeing a musical theater production, or other forms of collective art—are some of the moments in which I’ve felt most connected to others. Where else do waves of sound and light ripple through a space, enveloping a crowd of people, all experiencing the same performance yet each holding their own unique connection to the art? The fourth wall feels…holy? And ephemeral. It’s there, then it’s gone. Have you ever been in an empty theater? The magic lingers, but only briefly. The electricity that once pulsed through the space dissipates, leaving only echoes.

And yet, in those transient moments, something profound happens. Show tunes give voice to the unsaid. “Tomorrow” from Annie embodies the steadfast hope of new beginnings, no matter how heavy the present feels. “Losing My Mind” from Follies captures the ache of someone occupying your mind from the moment you wake. The weary cynicism of “Money, Money, Money” from Mamma Mia reveals the frustration of a world overrun by privilege and power. And “Cell Block Tango” from Chicago conveys the raw frustration of feeling misunderstood, the desire for others to see and validate your truth if only they knew the full story.

 

A PERSONAL NOTE

 

For me, “Breathe” from In the Heights resonates particularly deeply. At one point, 
        I made the difficult decision to take a leave from MIT for the fall of my sophomore year.
      
 As part of the MIT FLI (first-generation and/or low-income) community, the weight of that choice felt immense. It wasn’t just stepping back from school, but from a path my family and I had poured years of relentless grit into carving out, a path that carried the hopes of breaking cycles and building a better future. I worried constantly that I was letting them down, that I wasn’t living up to the sacrifices they had made.

“Breathe” captures that exact tension:

They regard me with pride And everyone’s sweet They say, “You’re going places” So how can I say that, while I was away I had so much to hide? Hey guys, it’s me The biggest disappointment you know The kid couldn’t hack it She’s back and she’s walkin’ real slow […] I am the one who made it out, The one who always made the grade, But maybe I should have just stayed home. When I was a child, I stayed wide awake, Climbed to the highest place, On every fire escape, Restless to climb. I got every scholarship, Saved every dollar, The first to go to college. How do I tell them why I’m coming back home? […] Can I go in there and say… “I know that I’m letting you down?”

[…]

I am the one who made it out, The one who always made the grade, But maybe I should have just stayed home. When I was a child, I stayed wide awake, Climbed to the highest place, On every fire escape, Restless to climb. I got every scholarship, Saved every dollar, The first to go to college. How do I tell them why I’m coming back home?

[…]

Can I go in there and say… “I know that I’m letting you down?”

Hearing those words—the restlessness, the pressure, the return—felt like seeing my own experience reflected back at me. It was grounding to realize this struggle wasn’t mine alone but one shared so deeply within my community that it even found its way into a show tune.

Live theater creates an unmatched resonance: a shared space where we confront the deeply personal but undeniably universal. The stories feel bigger than ourselves, yet so deeply our own. You’re watching these characters’ truths spill out in front of hundreds of strangers, and suddenly, your own truths feel seen. It’s that rare kind of magic, something profoundly human. In that shared moment, we all show up, gathering in one place to experience something together: art.

TANGENT

I’m not a theater kid, but I’m about as close as you can get without officially being one. Meaning, 
        I’ve never performed in a theater production,
      
 though I love theatre, and many of my friends are involved.

THE MAGIC OF MUSICAL THEATRE, EXPLAINED

 

The best, most-succinct argument I know for show tunes is, fittingly, told in a show tune. Yes, I know it’s a 10-minute video, but it’s so good. If you want to understand why people love 
        Broadway,
      
 aside from this blog, maybe this video is it.



THE MIT SHOW TUNES SCENE

The MIT Musical Theater Guild stages incredible productions. Over the years, I’ve seen them put on Into the Woods, Pippin, Heathers, Chicago, and most recently, Assassins. Truly impressive work.

Musicals often make their way through Boston, with Broadway in Boston serving as the main hub. There’s almost always a show in town, thanks in part to Boston’s close proximity to New York, where Broadway originated. If you live in Boston and want to catch a musical, 
        you can definitely get your fix.
      


My friends (L→R: me, Charlotte W. ‘23, Hillary A. ‘23, Kaira S. ‘23 (above), Oris S. N. ‘23 (below), Jupneet S. ‘23) and I saw Hamilton at the Citizens Opera House on February 12th, 2023.

Honestly, seeing actual Broadway in New York is pretty accessible, too. It’s just a four-hour train ride from Boston, and I’ve gone a few times with friends. Here are a few of those experiences:

I would be remiss not to mention Broadway Rave. It’s exactly what it sounds like: a rave blasting Broadway songs. They tour the country, and I usually go whenever they’re in town, which ends up being about 1-3 times a semester. I never get tired of it. I’m not much of a general rave-goer, but Broadway Rave? Absolutely. Dressing up as characters is a big part of the fun: my friends and I join in, and so do many others. The DJ often acts out the songs, mimicking the official stage production, and audience members can even take the stage if they know the choreography, are dressed as a character, or just feel inspired. I’ve been up there once, and it was a blast. The rave is so corny, cheesy, and over-the-top, and I love every second of it. My first Broadway Rave was on February 18th, 2023, thanks to an invitation from my friends Emma S. ‘26 and Charlotte W. ‘23.

The phrase “wicked smaht” is a Bostonian expression, fitting for a city with the most colleges in the country. I love how “wicked” already feels like part of the city’s DNA.

LITTLE THINGS THAT SHOW MY LOVE 

- The hook for my first public blog ever was a lyric from Wicked.

- For Halloween 2015, I dressed up as the Wicked Witch of the West. I even painted myself green. No, I’m not showing you the photos.

- For my birthday in 2021, my friend Charlotte W. ’23 got us matching Broadway pillows. Wicked is front and center.



- When my mind drifts during lecture, I either (a) doodle random things or (b) scribble down Wicked lyrics.

- Emails I’ve sent to my friends:

[Guest Post] Next Haunt 2024: The Haunters,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",1,2024-11-27T00:00:00-05:00,"Preface from Jebby: In addition to participating in Next Haunt with Andi and Aiden this year, I was also fortunate to have two Next Haunt staff members reply back to my request for a behind-the-scenes guest post. If you haven’t read Part 1, I encourage going back and reading it for context.

Dominic (Producer, “The Pigeon Man”)



Hey guys, its me, the Pigeon Man, but also the producer of this year’s Next Haunt! There is a lot that goes into making this happen every year, from the puzzles to arranging the build and actually running the thing. Because of that, I wanted to talk about some of the processes that went into making sure everything happened. Sophia will discuss this from a puzzle team perspective, so I’ll go in with a general overview of this year’s timeline!

[March] Recruitment – Part 1

The first major step to start Next Haunt is to recruit exec; most importantly being the producer, a.k.a me. The producers for last year’s Haunt—who became this year’s assistant producers—had interviewed me shortly before spring break about this role, although this was mostly for me to get information on the role rather than anything on their end. As I had been the sound designer the year before, they were already familiar with me. A week or so later, I got the email that I got the role!

[April to May] Recruitment – Part 2: Electric Boogaloo

My immediate first task was to recruit everybody else immediately important; namely the entirety of puzzle team, the art director, and the build director. Luckily, it wasn’t hard to get puzzle team or the art director, as both the puzzle lead (Sophia) and the art director had worked on Haunt the year before and were interested in continuing. Additionally, I was able to convince two of my friends to join puzzle team, as did Sophia, so puzzle team was pretty much filled pretty quickly.

Unfortunately, finding someone to be the build director was much harder. The previous build director was now a grad student, so we had to start from scratch to find someone else. Eventually, we did get a lone application for build director, which was from someone with no experience with Next Haunt, so I was hesitant. But seeing as how they were the only applicant for the position, we had to accept.

[May to August] Summer Scheming

Now that exec is recruited, we use the summer months to start planning for Haunt! The summer months are slow in this regard, but important stuff has to happen in this time for us to be able to do anything in the fall semester. Unfortunately, both the art director and build director were busy during the meetings, so they ended up being just the producers and puzzle team.

At this time though, we ended up on the MBTA theme (at the strong behest of one of the puzzle team members) and started planning out the house flow and puzzles. Importantly, we had to start getting in contact with 
        MIT EHS
      
 to prep for build in the fall, which is delegated to the build director. 

[August] REX Rampaging

Once August rolled around, we had to lock-in on advertising to the new frosh during 
        REX
      
 (especially since we cancelled the 
        CPW
      
 event that normally goes on), which meant we had to take a break from discussing the main event to focus on planning for this. Our REX event is primarily a mini-Haunt, where we recycle some puzzles from the year before and make a smaller version of Next Haunt that we run for the frosh.

In essence, because so much stuff is recycled from the year before, we just had to buy prizes and food for everyone (‘Cause everyone loves free food! This is a common theme this year) and set up the puzzles from last year. Running it wasn’t too bad either; we had one person handling reservations and checking everyone in, and a couple more people acting as scare actors to frighten the froshlings.

[September] Recruitment – Part 3: This Time It’s Personal

Now that September was here, it was time to do everyone’s favorite thing: more recruiting! Around this time, unfortunately, the build director had indicated they were unable to continue fulfilling their role, so we were scrambling to find a replacement.

Normally, for the fall, we recruit for less time-intensive positions so we get frosh. Namely on exec, we recruit art team, a costume designer, assistant build directors, and a sound designer (this year we didn’t recruit for sound specifically because my co-sound designer from last year was returning).

Luckily, we were able to recruit people for every role. We recruited a record of eight art team members (this will be important later). Additionally, we recruited an assistant build director which was very helpful for build. However, we needed more people to help to get this done.

[September to October] Sketchy Building

Because of the tight situation we were in, the assistant producers and I decided to just ask the rest of exec if they were able to become build directors as well. Surprisingly, four of the art team members had volunteered to become build directors in addition to the one we recruited. And let me tell you, having the five build directors really saved our asses in regards to getting this house done. We ended up having four build weekends where the house slowly but surely got built. I would love to talk about some of the stories that happened during build, but in the interest of not writing a novel, I’ll have to leave those for another day.

there was a problem on the ceiling

evil charlie on the evil mbta; also the puzzle team member who suggested the theme is named charlie

[October to November] Time to Scare Everyone!

After everything is built, now is the main event everyone has been waiting for: the Haunt itself.

I don’t have too much to add to this beyond what Sophia has said already, although I will say that, as Pigeon Man, it is very hard to be very scary when you see people struggling with arithmetic. Also, the bloggers were one out of only two groups to have all of their members escape the MBTA; they only got everyone out 
        because they were three people.
      


holy shit pigeon guy irl

another costume we used, mask was affectionately referred to as a certain article of clothing

[November] Sketchy Building – Now in Reverse!

Now that everyone was sufficiently scared, EHS required us to take down the building we put our sweat, tears, and blood into (It also takes up the entire Next House basement, so many others were also desiring the destruction of our beautiful piece of art). Thus, every year, we have to do a little thing called strike, where we unbuild the house. Unfortunately, destruction is less tantalizing than construction, so we didn’t get too many people to help strike (I had to pull in a favor to get a friend to help). Luckily, we were able to remove the house from the basement to start Haunt all over again next year.

[December?] PARTY TIME!!!

Except, Haunt isn’t over yet! There is no longer work to be done, but we still gotta celebrate our hard work. Thus, we are planning on having an after-party sometime before finals. This is a Next Haunt tradition, where exec has a dinner where they chill and hang out after everything was said and done, but this stopped because of COVID. But this year, it is coming back with a vengeance! Currently, the plan is to do an escape room with all of exec (very thematic) and then have a dinner with everyone. Once this is over, Next Haunt 2024 can be laid to rest.

Some other fun tidbits I wanted to mention before signing off –

- We had $850 budgeted for “interior design”. We were never planning on spending any of it on interior design. I have no idea why we still have that in the budget.

- We had to use a lot of duct tape during the build weeks; don’t worry it wasn’t load bearing duct tape, although EHS can’t have been happy about seeing duct tape all over.

- During one of the early runs, I was a zombie (not pigeon guy), but I tried a new thing where I just walked around the house after being let out; I was in there for a solid five minutes being a scream generator before I was told to leave cause I was too scary and hampering the group’s progress.

- So many people forget how to do 1d kinematics when they’re stuck in a dark room, given 25 minutes to escape, and with a scary pigeon headed man looming over them.

- Finally, one group saw the airport puzzle and said “I don’t wanna do math” and gave up entirely on that room.

Sophia (Puzzle Lead)



Hopefully from the perspective of those participating in the house (e.g. the above bloggers) everything was fun and epic and scary and definitely all functioning as intended. From the perspective of someone running the house, I can say there were literally zero times where everything functioned exactly as intended.

So then it’s a matter of triaging and deciding what things can be messed-up and is still ok, what things can be messed-up for now but should be changed soon, and what things need to be changed asap for the house to be a fun experience. There was a lot of stuff we were constantly changing on the spot because anticipating things in advance is hard, especially when the thing you’re trying to anticipate is “how will a group of human beings interact with our house, given they are potentially quite frightened but also maybe totally unafraid”.

For instance, from a puzzle perspective, we did a lot of changing how the puzzles worked on the spot because we realized they were too hard. Relatedly huge shoutout to build team for navigating a bunch of unanticipated challenges and still managing to build an entire house. Overall Next Haunt is a huge group effort and its kind of incredible that it all manages to come together, but its super fun to see so many groups of participants have fun with the finished product (we end up having on the order of 80ish groups with 5ish participants each).

Incomplete list of fun behind-the-scenes moments:

- At least two instances of the participants trying to scare the zombies (at one point I, as a zombie, made zombie noises at participants and they made zombie noises back at me??) 

- One of the puzzles involved hearing a melody and recreating it on a xylophone. Sometimes we would have a group of pretty tone-deaf participants (no hate, I am also quite tone-deaf) so I got to watch all of our musically inclined run crew take psychic damage as the participants played entirely the wrong notes

- This box. The label on the box not only makes sense in context, but it is also the most concise and accurate label there could possibly be for the box



- At an early exec meeting in like September someone offhandedly mentioned how they were scared of pigeons. What ensued was that our house included many pigeon-themed elements, from the art on the outside wall to one of the zombies dressing as a pigeon (It fits with the MBTA theme too! I just saw a pigeon on a Red Line train two days ago)

- Inside the house we wrote gullible on the ceiling. Sometimes participants would find it, and one time we told participants it said gullible on the ceiling and they immediately stopped doing all their puzzles to go look for it","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-25-at-5.44.40-PM-400x321.png

Things I did instead of thinking,Ellie F. '28,9,2024-11-27T00:00:00-05:00,"I know a lot of you are stressed. You have busy brains with rodent teeth that need to chew on something or you’ll grow wild and mad, and so you turn to chewing on college applications. Perhaps you’re like how I was—not-thinking about MIT decisions, much like how a child does not think about the marshmallow in front of her, or how you’re not thinking about a white elephant right now. Maybe, like me, your brain would do better on a different chew toy, brightly colored perhaps, the kind of treat that has nutrition or enrichment like the toys tigers get at the zoo.

I turned to hobbies, making things with my 
        brain and hands
      
 or just doing the equivalent of dangling some brightly colored yarn in front of a hyper cat. I know it helped me. Maybe it could help you too?

Minesweeper

Okay to be fair I’m not that proud of this one. I was semi-addicted to 
        Minesweeper
      
 in the months leading up to decision day. I could play with absolutely no thought. The numbers and colors burned into my brain until every night, as I started falling asleep, I unconsciously envisioned solving Minesweeper patterns like that scene from Queen’s Gambit with the chess on the ceiling (I never watched Queen’s Gambit so idk if this is actually accurate). This is an actual, documented, studied effect called the Tetris Effect! Aren’t brains cool?

Drawing

I’ve been making art my whole life, but I had put it on the back burner as college apps neared. Once those dreaded apps started, though, I suddenly felt that restless urge to study the lines of a ship and the blushes and shadows of a face. In stats I concentrated on the hatching of clouds instead of 
        p-values,
      
 in comparative government I rushed sloppy notes in favor of drawing the portraits of the economists on the slides. 

I also got back into digital art, rediscovering my fascination with bright colors and cool lighting. I played around with brushes and being bolder with colors and forming the planes of a face with hints of red and tints of blue.

Drawing planes

Around this time, I inexplicably started devouring airplane videos like my cat devours food when I’m ten minutes late feeding her. I would screenshot pretty liveries I liked and send them to my 
        friends.
      
 During lunch, or after school, at Quiz Bowl practice, I’d find those pictures to draw in my sketchbook.

Puzzles

Puzzlehunts are beautiful collections of clashing ideas, wordplay, obscure references, frustration, and fun. I started puzzling at the end of eighth grade, but as high school dug its claws into me, I found my time to sit down and stare at strange images and confusing crossword clues dwindled. After November 1st, though, I got that itch again. So, we got the band back together (the band being one other puzzly friend) and blew through nearly all of Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2023 and some of Cardinality Puzzle Hunt 2023
 as well. 

Two months later, my near-obsession about puzzlehunts rewarded me with my first group of MIT (and assorted) friends—a bundle of enthusiastic, silly people who I’d stay up late with, chatting and chasing loose threads down Wikipedia rabbitholes and making memes about particularly obstinate puzzles. 

I swear I’m not being paid by Big Puzzle, but if any of this sounds interesting to you, you should check out these cool more beginner-friendly puzzles: Colby’s Curious Cookoff, DP, Puzzled Pint (sometimes).

Crochet

There is nothing quite like making something soft and purple that you can hold in your hands. I learned the basics of crochet over the 
        summer at Mathcamp,
      
 but one week before a friend’s birthday, I decided it was time to pick up my hook and yarn again, like a retired bank robber accepting one last job with the gang. I never really got the hang of using patterns, but I found I could improvise and Macgyver simple plushies pretty well. 

You can make a lot of things with just a few simple skills. You’ll need a crochet hook, 
        a skein of yarn,
      
 and a yarn needle. I’d recommend learning chain stitch, single crochet, increase, invisible decrease, magic circle, and basic yarn sewing. It sounds like a lot but it really isn’t. For something more fancy, color changes are cool too! Give your friends a yarn heart to make them smile :) Try making yourself a gift of a flower or a cute blobby animal! 

Modular Origami

While I was at 
        Math Prize for Girls,
      
 I was entranced by the instructions for a simple origami cube laid out at our lunch table. Within a few days of returning home, I fell in love with modular origami, folding 
        Sonobe units
      
 instead of completing homework, looking up tutorials for fancier designs, and tearing and folding so much paper that my fingertips became red and sore. Modular origami has caught many a math lover in its snares, and I love the therapeutic repetition of folding modules, the fun symmetries and colorings of a great stellated dodecahedron, and just holding a 3D paper structure in my hands.

If you’re sitting here with restless hands and an overactive imagination about mid-December, or if you’ve always been thinking of trying a new hobby, or if you miss one you used to love, or if any of the things I’ve described seem interesting to you, then let me, an 18-year-old who was probably once described as wise for her age by an elementary school teacher, encourage you, a cool reader of the MIT blogs, to go for it. Join that club. Buy that book. Pick up that guitar. Try out that recipe. Lots of things in our future are out of our hands. But this—making ourselves a little more interesting, a little more knowledgeable, a little happier—this isn’t.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/minesweeper-1.png

[Group Post] Next Haunt 2024: The Survivors,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",6,2024-11-27T00:00:00-05:00,"Jebby

Every fall since 2014, Next Haunt puts together a horror-themed escape room in the Next House basement. In my opinion, it’s one of the coolest showcases of student culture here. Students pitch in their talents and skills—ranging from puzzle-making to set design—to put on a spooky show for the MIT community. In 2021, even former MIT president Rafael Reif had dared to escape the horrors!

Despite the fact that I’ve been living at Next House for 3.5 years, I still hadn’t done Next Haunt.



My excuse is that I forgot to sign up in the previous years. But that isn’t entirely true. For one, I get spooked easily. Whenever I entertained the idea of doing a Next Haunt run in the past, the shrieks from the basement would make me change my mind. I’m also not that good at solving puzzles, especially when I’m under pressure. Getting jumpscared in front of friends is one thing. But displaying my intellectual incompetence to them in real time? I could never.

But since this is my senior year, I decided to suck it up and be a big girl. I enlisted the help of my fellow bloggers so we can make it out of Next Haunt alive.



Andi

This was also my first year doing Next Haunt! I’d heard many great things about it (one of my friends was even a cast member two years ago), but I was always too lazy to gather a group and sign up. So when Jebby did all the hard work of securing a slot this year, I had no excuse not to sign up.

I really enjoy escape-room-style puzzles, and Next House is famous for housing many nerds clever people who create clever and interesting puzzles, so I was very excited about getting to solve these puzzles. Furthermore, Next Haunt was designed with a few quirks that made these puzzles especially challenging:

- We only had 30 minutes to escape (half of what a typical escape room would give us), so we needed to be extra speedy to solve all the puzzles in time.

- The “room” was actually a big wooden shipping container-sized box in the Next House basement, so it was completely dark inside. We were given flashlights to help us navigate, but whoever held the flashlights couldn’t write things down and had to rely on verbal communication.

- Also, Next Haunt was a horror escape room, so we’d get jump-scared by screaming zombies while doing long multiplication (yes, the puzzles were very mathematical). As if that wasn’t terrifying enough, if any of these zombies managed to touch you, you would be “eliminated” from the game. (I later learned that the cast members were told not to eliminate anyone but just get close.)

The first puzzle we faced was an empty room with a colorful toy xylophone, a combination lock, and various newspaper clippings lining the walls. After a minute of confused silence, we realized that the eerie tune playing in the background was also a part of the puzzle. At first, I tried replaying it on the xylophone, hoping a door would magically open. But then I remembered that we were standing in a wooden box with no electronics inside, so that didn’t work. Instead, Jebby and Aiden noticed that the newspaper clippings were numbered and were about specific MBTA train lines (each corresponding to some color). Using these color-number pairs and the colors of the xylophone, we decoded the combination lock and moved on to the rest of the escape room!



Immediately after entering the next section, a scary-looking zombie wearing a pigeon mask burst into the room and split our team in half, which was unfortunate because we were only a group of three (whereas most people do Next Haunt in groups of five or six). Jebby and Aiden were together in one group, while I was left alone in the other.

Giving me no time to process what had just happened, the pigeon-headed zombie ushered me to the next puzzle (Jebby and Aiden got a different puzzle). My puzzle involved using tarot cards to unscramble a message dispersed between three fortune cookie fortunes. I think the intended solution was to walk around the room and use the clues written on the walls, but instead of doing that, I just sat there staring at the slips of paper and trying to unscramble the message in my head. Somehow, this strategy actually somewhat worked, and I managed to unscramble almost the entire message (mostly because I guessed it would involve numbers)!

“Forty-thr… ifty-six? Aha – 4356! That must be the code to the combination lock in front of me!”

However, the lock would not open, and for two reasons: I was missing some letters from the middle of the message (the correct message was “forty-three times fifty-six”), and (more embarrassingly) I was also trying to open the wrong lock.

At this point, we only had about three minutes left to escape. The pigeon-headed zombie must have felt sorry for us because after witnessing me trying to open the wrong lock, they brought me the correct lock and handed me a TI-84 calculator. (Good call on their end – I would not have been able to do the long multiplication in my head.)



It turned out that my puzzle was the last puzzle we needed to escape! So with just one minute to spare, Aiden, Jebby, and I made it out of Next Haunt alive!

Aiden

As a fresh-faced MIT first year, it was only recently that I learned of such important MIT Halloween traditions like Next Haunt. I was walking out of the Next dining hall when I saw a poster with a QR code, told my roommates we should sign up, and then instantly forgot about it until I received an invitation from Jebby. 

Theoretically, Next Haunt should have been where I really showed off my skills. I have been obsessed with escape rooms and everything even horror-adjacent for years. Plus, I go to MIT, so I should be able to do a simple puzzle, right?

Wrong!

The only MIT “puzzle” (AKA the most complicated, time-consuming, and well-put- together thing you’ve ever seen) I had attempted at MIT so far was when the school rented out the Boston Aquarium for a nighttime party/puzzle-solving-sesh at the end of orientation. Apparently most people didn’t finish despite working almost all three hours on it, but a friend and I immediately gave up and went out to the deck to get churros instead. So much to say, I was not going to be the most helpful at Next Haunt.

This was proven true, the moment we stepped into the pitch-black room that was just a little too claustrophobic, all of my skills, hopes, dreams, and aspirations crumbled. I wasn’t so petrified that I couldn’t talk, but Jebby and I definitely stood in the corner furiously looking around us while Andi did the first puzzle (thanks king!). 

Naturally when we were forced to split, Andi, as the smartest and tallest, was forced to be alone, leaving me and Jebby in a room plastered in MBTA maps and an ominous 6:34 written on the wall. And when I tell you that I have never been more grateful that 
        something wasn’t filmed!
      
 I felt like one of those celebrities that would go on Ellen or Jimmy Fallon and do a horror escape room and just look so incredibly stupid (it was hilarious, though).



The puzzle had us do basic unit conversions (i.e. minutes to hours) to find how long it would take to get from a T stop in Boston back to Next House. Out of generosity, Scary Bird Man visited me and Jebby very frequently to point at the maps in a specific order to give us clues.



He did this so many times that it prompted me to ask if he was disappointed in us, at which he shook his head and just handed us a TI-84. After getting the answer wrong another ~1000 times, we stumbled along the right answer and were handed out silver coins to escape the T.

Since we escaped barely in time, the three of us got to solidify our legacy by writing our names in Sharpies on the list of previous winners. 

Overall I am disappointed by how emasculated I felt by the dark, a bird mask, and middle-school algebra, but I am so glad I got to take part in an MIT tradition that I’ll get for the next three years!

Closing statement by Jebby

Our names are forever immortalized as one of the smartest and bravest souls to pass through Next Haunt. Nobody will know that I shrieked and ran from a guy in a pigeon mask.

On the other hand, Petey and other admissions officers went right after us, and they met the demise that we managed to avoid.

chances,Kai V. '25,4,2024-11-26T00:00:00-05:00,"There’s a clear, one-to-one correspondence between the semesters at MIT I consider “successful” and the semesters during which I accepted the most help from and collaboration with others. Freshman spring: I psetted a couple times a week, for two of my classes, with someone who became one of my closer friends here. Junior fall: I went to office hours and recitations consistently. Junior spring: I took the experimental physics capstone, which pairs you with one lab partner for the entire class, and you spend anywhere between 10 and 30 hours a week together.


In my experience, the more common way that collaborative problem-solving happens is that one person figures out how to solve the problem and then teaches the other person. To actually solve a problem together, first you need to find a partner whose level of familiarity with the material is around the same as yours, and then it takes time to develop the deep, genuine trust needed to take a person through each step of your problem-solving process when you don’t know yet whether it’s correct. When all the factors align and you really come to a solution together, it feels like the gates to heaven are opening.

All this is to say that successful collaboration is very gratifying. You’ve heard the refrain: it’s what makes the late nights worth it! But it is also hard. It’s so much easier to try and do everything yourself, with no one else to bear witness to your failures—and to avoid having to point out the pitfalls of others. It seems like working with other people should be easy, but it requires a level of vulnerability and trust that has always felt near-impossible for me to put forth.

This goes beyond academics: junior year was so great for me in part because it was the first time I treated my 
        UROP
      
 meetings as chances to clarify misunderstandings and learn how I could improve my research process, as opposed to being stressed on a weekly basis about having produced enough results for my mentor. For those unfamiliar with the structure of a UROP, here’s how it’s typically gone for me. You work under a Principal Investigator (PI)—a professor who is the head of the lab—but you interact more directly with a graduate student or postdoc who acts as your mentor, meeting with you weekly-ish to go over updates and discuss what you’ll do in the coming week. I’ve been fortunate to only have had supportive UROP experiences with people who seemed invested in my success and wellbeing.

But it still took two years during which I was basically constantly UROPing to understand that those people really wanted to help me. During my first UROP I was always having stress dreams the nights before meetings, thinking about whether I had done enough work, whether I should run a few more simulations, make a few more plots before the meeting. After a second and a third UROP, I seriously wondered whether I would ever be able to hold down a 9-to-5. I would go to the office, and just sitting in the same room as my mentor would fill me with so much anxiety—I mean, on a physical level—my hands would shake, I’d start sweating, feel dizzy, heartbeat through the roof. During the stretches over IAP or summer that I did full-time work, I arrived at the office at 7 a.m. some days or stayed until 7 p.m., worried that showing up later or leaving earlier than my mentor would reveal a fundamental, character-defining laziness. At the core of all this anxiety was the biting fear that my mentor would finally realize how stupid I was and how misguided they had been to allow me on the project.

After a year and a summer of working with my current mentor, finally this fear mostly subsided. I actively look forward to my meetings now, and actually I think the academia ivory tower really popped off when it invented one-on-one mentorship: it’s so educational and productive to have someone much more experienced than myself be so dedicated to my progress! Basically: people forgive you. People are patient. If you’re making a real effort, the right people will always give you more chances.

But sometimes it feels like I’ve missed all my chances. Somehow it took seven semesters for me to learn what’s always been espoused as the core tenet of the MIT undergraduate experience—that you can do much more working together than working alone.

You could say I’ve at least improved since freshman year, but progress is not monotonic. I started out this semester taking 6.2220, Power Electronics Laboratory. It’s a very time-consuming class that I had been really looking forward to. I loved spending time in lab, learning more about the design process, the feeling when I made a circuit work. But I was basically doing everything alone. The thought of going up and putting my name on the help queue sent roiling waves of anxiety through my stomach—instead I’d spend three hours debugging something that could have been resolved simply earlier on had I asked a TA. I didn’t know anyone else in the class and I wasn’t sure how to start talking to anyone. I’d hear everyone else working through problems together around me and wonder if it was too late to try to find some support. But my fear of being perceived as this dumb slow person would win out. Finally, mid-October, some unrelated events happened in my life that made me fall behind on the lab and I dropped the class.

I was really sad about it. I’m a senior and it’s a fall-only class, so now I’ll never be able to take it. I think this could have been avoided if I talked to, like, one person. Even though it’s really hard. You just have to do it. Things here are not really designed to be done alone, or you would be restricted to doing much simpler things.

Even more so than academics, I struggled with socializing. I had a really hard time interacting with most people I knew in my first two years here. What carried me through that time was spouting phrases that conveyed zero information, like a bad AI: “so true bestie” (this one is great because you can say it in response to literally anything), “how’s it going → well, it’s going! *comedic sounds of despair*”, “I’m sooo hosed haha” (I was almost never actually hosed when I said this one), “I only got x hours of sleep last night”, “I have a caffeine addiction”, whatever, whatever. This stream of emptiness that I fell back on because despite my desperate wild flailing I could not, for whatever reason, actually connect with people. Every interaction felt like I was watching myself interact from afar, like there was a glass wall between me and the rest of the world that I might be able to breach if only I said the right thing, and I never did.

I came to MIT being under the impression—based on how intensely the quirky/nerdy student culture is 
        advertised
      
—that you find a semblance of family here, people who really understand you for the first time. When this didn’t happen within a year or two (despite putting an intense and genuine effort into four clubs and two living communities) but I saw everyone around me hanging out at 3 a.m. with their New Chosen Family, well, the problem was obviously me. Shouldn’t I have been able to tap into a profound connection with others, by necessity of being at MIT together?
 I still don’t know why it was so hard then, even with people I thought were super cool, hovering around trying to think of how to start a conversation and keep it going.

But on my third living community, finally I no longer feel like an alien species trying to mimic human interaction. I just, you know, Hang Out with people. It’s awesome. It was totally worth three years of exploration. And it wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t decide to keep being open to friendship, to keep actively trying to find people I might want to stay up until 3 a.m. chatting with, to go on spontaneous late-night trips to Harvard with.

Looking back, I wish I did a lot of things differently. Had I been insistent on working with others from the start, I could have learned a lot more about physics, and math, and electrical engineering. Maybe I would now have the confidence and experience to apply to graduate school in physics, to keep chasing a field that always ruled over my heart even when I didn’t know what in the world I wanted to use it for. And those things I might have learned are things it will be much harder to learn once I leave MIT; some of them, I’m sure, I will never learn.

And yet—when I was a smol confused freshman, my UROP mentor, who was endlessly patient and wise and whom I was nevertheless intimidated as hell by, taught me emacs and Linux and the entire mindset I use to think about research problems now. As a sophomore, all those clubs I joined and dropped out of showed me what I didn’t want to pursue in the future. As a junior—well, no notes, 10/10 year. And as a senior, I realize—long overdue—that there are plenty of people at MIT for me to find profound, deep connections with, or just to laugh at memes with.

So here is what I learned, floundering around feeling alone, even if I missed out on some physics and math in the process. That you should keep trying, again and again, that even when connection feels elusive, at the end of the day it’s the only thing you have, and that alone makes it worth the effort. That people really want to help you, and you should let them. People who are experienced and passionate and kind—and there are a lot of those kinds of people here—will always give you more chances than you think, more chances even than you might give yourself.",,0
Unveiling the New Varsity Weight Room,Emiko P. '25,3,2024-11-23T00:00:00-05:00,"After a seven-ish month renovation, the new Varsity Weight Room is now open! Accessible to all those who participate in a varsity sport at MIT, the new VWR is now double the size, has double the number of racks, has a new turf speed and agility section, and a bunch of other fun gadgets and gizmos. 

Let’s take a tour.

us when we see the new varsity weight room

before renovation versus after

tons of dumbbells and medicine balls

i saw people doing lots of different things on the speed and agility turf: activation warm up, stretching, sled pulls, core exercises, box jumps

men’s soccer stretching after putting in the work

nice selection of stretching materials

fun cable machines

lots of these TVs all around the room so you know what part of the lift you’re on

SUPER EXCITING WATER FOUNTAIN. LOOK HOW COOL.

jumping for joy! we <3 the new vwr

It was super cool to get to lift in the new VWR. In the old weight room, we were hitting our heads on the ceilings, it was cramped and crowded, and there were barely enough squat racks 
        for the soccer team.
      
 It was awesome that the Athletics Department took the initiative to build a new weight room that will help create the next generation of super buff
        Engineers.
      
 I can’t wait for all the PRs we’re gonna demolish in here!

And the Whistle Blows,Emiko P. '25,2,2024-11-21T00:00:00-05:00,"Soccer season is officially over. Holy smokes does time fly. It feels like I just stepped on campus to begin preseason, and now I’m handing in my practice gear and taking down the decorations in my locker.

So, how exactly did the rest of our season go? In my last update, I regaled you about our successful regular season. Which leaves me to tell you about how our post-season went. 

Winning our regular season conference title and securing the #1 seed in the conference tournament was cool and all, but what we really wanted was the big shiny silver trophy you get for being the conference tournament champion. 

To get our hands on that trophy, we had to play 3 games in one week, reuniting with opponents that we had already played (and beat) previously during the regular season. Here are the results of that week.

- Tuesday: 2-1 win against Coast Guard

- Thursday: 1-0 win against Babson

- Saturday: 3-0 win against Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) 

With our Saturday win against WPI, we officially became NEWMAC TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS RAHHHHHH!! We snatched up that silver trophy and checked off a huge goal on our season bucket list! It really doesn’t get much better than a conference championship :) 

NEWMAC champs!!

 

Any team that wins their conference championship automatically gets a bid to the D3 NCAA tournament, which is the national tournament. We absolutely had our sights on performing well and going far in this tournament. My freshman year, we got as far as the Elite Eight, but this year we were unfortunately knocked out in the Round of 32. We won our first game against SUNY Geneseo 3-1, but lost the very next day to Colby College 2-0. We ended our season with a record of 21-2-1, and we tied MIT soccer’s longest winning streak ever at 15 games. And just like that, our season was over. 

But not only was our season over, but suddenly so was my 15 year competitive soccer career.

When I was in seventh grade, 
        I broke my foot.
      
 My dad told me that he found me crying one day, wearing my new boot, saying, “I only have ten more years left of soccerrrrrrr.” The only way I would possibly be able to play ten more years of soccer at the time was if I was planning on playing in college. My dad had never considered the fact that I would want to play in college, and honestly, I hadn’t thought about it either. I guess this specific instance was the moment when college soccer became a conscious idea in my mind.

It is almost absurd to think that the time my seventh-grade self had been dreading – that distant ten-year future where I would one day be done playing competitive soccer – has finally come. Time flies, man.

Honestly, talking about soccer right now is kind of hard. It’s only been a few days, and it’s hard to process how I most likely won’t play competitive soccer again. Soccer has been the common denominator that my life at MIT has revolved around. Every weeknight from 5 to 7 pm is spent out on a turf field. Nearly every Wednesday is a bus trip to a random liberal arts college somewhere in the Northeast. Saturdays are spent on Roberts field, friends and family in the stands. Not to mention the physical part of it all: the feeling of sprinting after a loose ball, running despite a cramp in your side, shaking your legs as the winter chill creeps into your muscles – all these feelings are replaced by eerie quiet and stillness now that the season is over. They are replaced by an antsy anticipation, by the sensation that your muscles should be doing something. 

I worked out for the first time since our season ended, and I’m trying to find ways to deal with this sudden loss of purpose. If I’m not working out to get stronger and faster on the soccer field, then what am I working out for? For literally my entire life, my motivator to push through the pain of every workout, to hold my plank for just 15 seconds longer, to add weight to the squat bar, to push myself just one more lap around the track, has been so that I can be a better soccer player. 

Now what?

I wonder what new purpose I will find to motivate me. Maybe there’s a way to be optimistic about all this. After all, there is a certain sense of freedom that comes with my ties to competitive soccer being abruptly snipped. I know I love athletics, so maybe I will pick up new sports or activities. Maybe I will dance more. Maybe I will play tennis. Maybe I will do yoga. And I guess my time playing soccer hasn’t entirely ended. I will no doubt be tearing it up on the pickup fields at MIT and lifting with the soccer team until I graduate. 

All that’s left now is to be thankful. Thanks to my coaches, who believed in me every step of the way. That belief has now become a fundamental part of my being. I’ll carry that 
        “swag”
      
 with me now wherever I go. Thanks to my teammates throughout the years, who are now spread all over the country, but especially to the ones here with me now in Cambridge. The soccer team has been the home that has raised me since I was a freshman at MIT, and I hope that me and the other seniors have done our part in maintaining that home this year. You all will do amazing things (including win a National Championship for us hopefully). Thanks to all the trainers, who have patched up every inch of my body at this point and who are one of the few that can say they’ve been present for all the ups and downs of an athlete’s journey. Thanks to the friends and family of the soccer team, who are always there to wave when you look into the crowd and who are always there to feed us goodie bags after games. Thanks to the soccer alumni, who were one of the first to hug the seniors after we played our final game and who have always cheered so loud that we can hear them from across the country.

Wow, I will miss it. I will miss the feeling of slamming into another girl to steal a ball, flying and jumping to win a header, wanting to win so badly it consumes you. I will miss it all. The energy. The people. The joy.

"FYI: Undergraduates with family income below $200,000 can expect to attend MIT tuition-free starting in 2025",Chris Peterson SM '13,6,2024-11-20T00:00:00-05:00,"First, let me start with a venerable and ancient blogger apology: sorry for not blogging much lately. With my new-ish role —  Director of Communications and Special Projects — I am doing more writing than ever, but the kind that is often read by a half dozen people within MIT. It’s sort of like 
         playing Elden Ring on a dex/faith build: small, fast melee weapons with the occasional distance spellcasting.
      


Anyway, here is today’s Golden Vow, via MIT News:

Undergraduates with family income below $200,000 can expect to attend MIT tuition-free starting next fall, thanks to newly expanded financial aid. Eighty percent of American households meet this income threshold. And for the 50 percent of American families with income below $100,000, parents can expect to pay nothing at all toward the full cost of their students’ MIT education, which includes tuition as well as housing, dining, fees, and an allowance for books and personal expenses. …
These new steps to enhance MIT’s affordability for students and families are the latest in a long history of efforts by the Institute to free up more resources to make an MIT education as affordable and accessible as possible. Toward that end, MIT has earmarked $167.3 million in need-based financial aid this year for undergraduate students — up some 70 percent from a decade ago.

You can read more in the article, but basically, in Admissions and SFS, we are mission-driven to make MIT a magnet for the most talented students in the world interested in an education centered on science and technology, and to make it accessible to the best students regardless of their financial circumstances. That’s why our financial aid meets full need, our admissions is need-blind, and we don’t have an admissions preference for the children of alumni or donors (which can be seen in the public data from economists at Opportunity Insights). We hope that these new, 
        clearly communicable policies
      
will help make everyone understand that if they are admitted to MIT, they will be able to afford to attend. And I wanted to make sure everyone who reads the blogs knows that.",,0
🦆🦆🦆🏳️🏳️🏳️ 🦖🦖🦖,Ellie F. '28,1,2024-11-17T00:00:00-05:00,"153 minutes before the deadline to sign up for the Simmons Retreat, I got an email. We noticed you filled out the interest form, it said, but that you haven’t filled out the binding form. I had already accepted that I couldn’t go—I had promised to go to a Puzzle Club event on Monday, when I expected the retreat would still be going on. But a short email exchange later, I realized we actually would be back in time.

I’ll fill out the form, then, I responded. tysm!!

The Simmons Retreat was taking place over our student holiday, from Saturday, October 12th to Monday, October 14th at our Heads of House’s cabin in Concord, MA. As we drove, I briefly considered working on my crochet, but I got carsick without even completing a single round. Instead, I watched the trees whisk by as I defended myself against accusations that I had actually snuck out and painted all the leaves red and orange and gold and yellow. Don’t be silly, I laughed. That would take forever, and you know I had midterms all this week. I only painted one or two, the yellow ones, near Simmons.

They said the cabin would be on a pond but we all agreed it was a lake. We poked around the cabin and its airy rooms and dog beds, and then we dispersed to unpack and set up our beds. We got a tour of the cabin, and then three of us went outside to draw trees. I don’t know what I’m doing, we all said. My sketch isn’t really very good. The drawings were all beautiful.

 

After lunch, we traipsed through the yellow-orange woods. On the way, we saw the shell of a blue car, and we chained together clover flowers until we reached Merrill Farms. I fawned over little bees and bright petals and tried to tuck flowers into hair. As we headed back, the sun sank low and lit up blades of grass, and I lingered a bit behind the group, making conversation without really knowing what I was saying, and feeling like this all was a little bit too fantastical to be real.

In the evening, a few of us practiced choreography for DanceTroupe, and after we ate and cleaned up dinner and dessert, we talked about Simmons, astronomy, and song lyrics. At night, I danced in the dark and tried to map out all the stars I couldn’t see from Cambridge.

The next day, after breakfast, we went apple picking, a quintessential fall thing that I had never been aware of. All us freshmen banded together as a troop, marching through the forest to the far side of the orchard on recommendation by one of the employees. I skipped ahead and darted back like an overexcited labrador retriever. I finally get the appeal of biting into apples, I thought to myself, after indulging in my first apple straight off the branch. This is SO much better than the ones in the dining halls.

We filled our bags and stomachs with varieties of apples I’ve never heard of. Then, we browsed the farm store, digging through gourds of various shapes and sizes and contemplating whether the price of a pie was worth it. The rest of our group found us there, and we shared cider and donuts under the misty rain.

When we got back, we dispersed onto various couches and chairs to get some feeling back into our fingers and to work, or in my case, play UC Love. Since we had apples, of course we had to bake, and though I’m mostly useless in the kitchen, I’m something of an artist, myself. Jesus CHRIST what is that thing?? said someone (probably). I think I need more dough, I said.

I had a hard time the week before retreat. I was stressed and alone, spending my free time hunched over my desk studying for dreaded midterms. Every night, I curled up in my comfort hoodie, in bed far earlier than usual. The Simmons Retreat was what I needed to take a step back and revel in the beauty of the fall and the warmth of my friends. MIT is a neverending waterfall. It’s the Energizer Bunny that keeps going and going and going. But I can keep going too, and share some warm cider with my friends on the way.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lake-1-800x360.jpg

*THE* double,Veronica P. '27,2,2024-11-17T00:00:00-05:00,"Meet my roommate and me:

I’m not quite sure when it happened, but if I had to guess it was sometime around 3 am, sharing food on the sofa of our freshman year suite and undoubtedly procrastinating far more important matters—

 

“If we’re doubling together, I feel like we could really lock into making our room, like, the best room ever.” 

“Oh not just any double, THE double.” 

 

And thus, The Double was born.

The inception of this idea sent us down a pinterest-boarding, wishlist-making, room-blue-printing spiral. By the time we said our goodbyes in May, The Double was already a space in our minds. Sometimes, when I found myself gazing for long enough upon my childhood bedroom— the one that, post-graduation, felt eerily like every bit of me that I’d thought I’d outgrown or discarded— I’d close my eyes and visit that corner of my mind, letting our brainchild buoy me back to Boston.

Soon enough, of course, we found ourselves actually back on campus— our return expedited by promises to help our floor (Burton One!) run events for all of the newcomers to our building. And while that promise probably took a year off our lives — story for another time?— it gave us time to lock into the double before classes came around. As soon as we got the chance, we borrowed a car and headed out to Cambridge Antiques and IKEA, resolved to finish The Double by the next day.

a photo from our travels

Well, until we developed the motto, “The Double is never finished” — tapping into some optimism that each new outing presented the chance to find another addition to our home.

And, three months into The Double, I can confirm that quite a bit has been added. As of right now, however, here is a completely updated tour:

THE view:

our room looks over the Charles, and we always get a great view of the sunrise (in the rare moments where we’ve been awake for it)

THE desks:

 

THE beds:

THE mini fridge:

“of course you guys won’t even get a normal mini fridge”

And that’s about it! I’ll admit, I probably have an inordinate amount of love for a few square feet that I’ll have to pack up in about six months. But, when I consider all the memories this room has collected for me—along its walls and upon its surfaces— and all the memories made within this room— devising outfits in the mirror and tackling projects on the desks and outpouring emotions atop the floor cushions— that love doesn’t feel all that inordinate to me.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC00530-1-800x1422.jpg

tick

The institute is always churning. 

tick

There’s a constant sound in the back of my head, a whirring that keeps my mind thinking about what I need to do next, instead of what I’m doing right now.

tick

This is 
        a place that never sleeps.
      
 Even in the quietest moments of the night, you can find someone mulling away over work. Any time of day I walk through campus—like the rare and dreadful 4am stroll from a campus library back to my dorm—I will bump into at least several people. At least I know that I’m not alone.

tick

I’m fucking exhausted.

tick

Have I done anything worthwhile here? It feels like I haven’t used my time wisely at all. It feels like I’ve done nothing for this school. I’ve squandered my opportunities. I’ve messed up real, reaaaaaaaal bad.

tick

Nothing feels right; everything feels wrong.

tick

MIT is offering me so much opportunity. How dare I feel like this is all too much? I should be more grateful.

…

It’s such a privilege to be here. I’m really fortunate to be able to do everything I want to do.

tick

Would someone please acknowledge all of the hard work I’ve put in? God. In high school, it felt like I got some form of a gold star every week. An award of sorts, a good test grade, positive affirmation directly from my teacher, whatever. It was much easier to do exceptional things and be recognized for it. Now, I get nothing. 

tick

Everyone here is brilliant. How the fuck did I get in?

tick

I’m just going to shut up, put my nose to the grindstone, and stick it out until the next long break. I can make it if I just focus and let nothing get in my way.

tick

I feel like despite operating at my max capacity, I’m just barely scraping by. I’m doing the bare minimum. I’m average at best. Why can’t I excel anymore? I’m just barely keeping it together. 

tick

Why am I taking this class again? Why am I in this club? Why am I doing… any of this???

tick

I can’t get peace here. I feel insane.

tick

The firehose is real. There is simply so, so much going on. Heavy coursework. Abundant extracurriculars. Boston festivities. And everything else in-between. 


        MIT classes take so much god damn work.
      
Students can join basically any club they want, which is dangerous, because
        they want it all.
      
And, people here aren’t scared of having fun, so we embody “work hard play hard” culture, but, my god, do I wish it didn’t have to be so hard??????? Can’t we simply just work and play? Without the hard part? Please?

tick

I will not let this institute break me.

…

I love the challenge. In high school, I often had to push myself because I wasn’t challenged enough. Now, at a school that truly pushes me, I feel like I’m finally able to reach my potential.

tick

I feel like I can’t stop. I’m not allowed to. If I do, I wouldn’t be making the most of my time here. And that would be regretful.

tick

I feel like I don’t understand anything on a deep level in any of my classes. I could, but I simply can’t make the time to. Once an assignment is turned in, I can’t reflect; I have to pour hours into the next one immediately. This is frustrating because I want to develop mastery of the content, and that is something that MIT prides itself in. But, I have to move on. I have to keep my head held high.

tick

I’m a failure. I’m doing so much. And, in doing far too much, I have done nothing.

tick

Sometimes, in trying to do all of the things, I’ve lost sight of why I’m doing anything. I’ve had to take moments to step back and ask myself: What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Is this something I truly want to continue?

But, I don’t have time to think about these things right now. If I do, I won’t be able to stay on pace with everything in my life. I just have to keep going.

…

I’ve never felt more understood by others. Everyone at MIT is such a beautiful nerd at heart. And, even though we’re all toughing it out in some way, we go through it together. We show we care. We show up for each other. 

tick

I feel stupid. I made poor decisions that got me into this state where my mind can’t take any breaks.

tick

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I’m just trying to keep my head afloat in this storm I’ve inflicted onto myself. 

…

I should get dinner with my friend. Work is important, but meals and friends are also important. I wonder if they’ve also had a lot of racing thoughts.

tick

Man, this is hard to go through alone, but maybe they’re doing just fine, and I’m the only one struggling. Maybe I won’t tell them. I don’t want to come off as dumb and weak.

…

I… should probably tell them what’s going on in my head. These floodgates are going to break one way or another, and we might as well endure the tides together. I should ask if they’re okay with receiving this kind of information right now—my struggles and all. I think they’ll understand.

…

Oh. 

Wow. 

They were experiencing eerily similar things and were glad I brought it up. I was freaking out over bringing up my struggles and for what? It feels good to be seen, to be understood. 

I’m… not alone?

 We’re not alone. 

No one here is alone. 

MIT is a fucking tough school, but it has even tougher students to get through it. 

…

They made me feel like everything was going to be okay, and I think I did the same for them. Together, we reworked our plans to make life more manageable: taking late days, seeking extra tutoring, or stepping back from a club. It’s hard to figure out what truly matters sometimes, but having someone to help prioritize makes a world of difference.

I think everything’s gonna be okay. ☺

I want to do so many things, but I have to remind myself: I am only one person, and I need to spend my time wisely.

What really matters to me?

These four years will pass quickly, but if I focus on that question, I’ll walk out stronger, better, and ready for whatever comes next.

…

After bridging that topic, we started catching up on each others’ lives.

Have you been enjoying the rare, temperate weather of Boston? How’s family? Your brother still asking you to help with math homework? Do you have a favorite fruit? Is your high school friend still working on writing a book? Did you hear about that new public art installation downtown? Wanna go? Have you ever gone sailing? What’s made you feel happy recently? …and so on

What’s made you feel happy recently?

…and so on

…

For the latter half of our conversation, we talked about music a lot. We indulged on our recent favorite drops. Some summery pop hits, a tinge of psychedelic rock, a looot of bossa nova.

There are many concerts in Boston! We expressed being grateful to be in a city where music was like air; it was everywhere. We talked about going to an alt rock concert or jazz bar together this weekend.

…

Wait… how had that many hours gone by?

It felt like time stopped for a moment, and it was just us.

Friends spending quality time together.

As they say, I guess time flies when you’re around people you love.

Mathisms,Allison E. '27,5,2024-11-15T00:00:00-05:00,"There exists a nontrivial subset of the MIT population for whom the intersection of their everyday language and mathematical jargon is non-empty.

In other words, MIT is overrun with math people who cannot help but speak in tongues math gibberish. It’s almost inevitable in this little cauldron of nerds. You start with a soup of universally strong math backgrounds, then toss in a couple hundred ultra math nerds, and a couple hundred more ultra ultra math nerds, and suddenly you can smell the scent of math wafting into the next room. It’s in the name, after all–the Mathachusetts Institute of Technology.

Now, you may have heard of some of our linguistic quirks before. For example, many know that MIT’s buildings aren’t named, but rather numbered. Or that we introduce our majors by number (“I’m a 
        Course 16
      
”). Or that we throw around class numbers with 
        reckless abandon
      
. But that’s only scratching the tip of the surface here. It gets much worse.

However, as the token non-math person of a very mathy friend group, today I shall serve as a questionably accurate translator between you, dear reader, and the cauldron math degeneracy. This is not a 
        rigorous
      
 case study, but it does use (mostly) real quotes I’ve heard around campus. Let us begin :)

orthogonal

Example: “This is almost orthogonal to the previous discussion” Translation: “This is almost completely unrelated to the previous discussion” Explanation: In math, ‘orthogonal’ means perpendicular, or forming a right angle with something. People generally use it to mean ‘unrelated,’ the way ‘tangential’ is used to mean ‘only vaguely related before branching off completely into lalaland’ (the way that a line tangent to a circle moves with the circle for only a moment before diverging). 9/10

this reminds me of too many math problems

there exists

Example: “There exists a future in which I drop this class” Translation: “I might drop this class” Explanation: ‘There exists’ is just a fancy way to say ‘there is,’ while simultaneously making the syntax way more complicated than necessary. It’s just a way to sound fancy. 5/10

subset

Example: “This is just a subset of my thoughts” Translation: “These are just some of my thoughts” Explanation: According to Wikipedia, a set A is a subset of a set B if all elements of A are also elements of B. For example, ‘dogs’ are a subset of ‘mammals’ because all dogs are mammals. ‘Mammals’ is not a subset of ‘dogs,’ because not all mammals are dogs. I think this is mainly used just to sound fancy–you can say ‘some’ with the same meaning. 6/10

{even numbers} is a subset of {(natural) numbers}

(non)trivial

Example: “This PSet is taking me a nontrivial amount of time” Translation: “This PSet is taking me a while” Explanation: The word ‘trivial’ is SO common at MIT. I don’t think I ever heard it in everyday conversation before coming here, but technically some normal people do generally use it as something like ‘unimportant’ or ‘insignificant.’ In math contexts, though, ‘trivial’ generally refers to something that’s relatively simple or straightforward to show/prove. For example, a trivial solution to the Pythagorean theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 is a = 0, b = 0, and c = 0. People at MIT use both definitions–
        ‘insignificant’ and ‘easy’
      
–and then apply it to everything. You cannot escape the trivial. 8/10

epsilon

Example: “It’s getting warm, I’m going to open the window by epsilon” Translation: “I’m going to open the window a bit” Explanation: The lowercase Greek letter epsilon (ε) is often used to denote a very small number. I’ve seen it mostly when analyzing what happens to a system (such as a pendulum) if you give it a small nudge in one direction, and in everyday conversation it means the same thing. This one is unusual in that it’s mainly a notation convention, which is kinda fun. 7/10

such that

Example: “Should the laws be changed such that the state has less power?” Translation: “Should the laws be changed so that the state has less power?” Explanation: I think you can usually replace ‘such that’ with ‘so that,’ but there are subtle nuances. After 20 minutes of research, contemplation, and attempted synthesis of the thoughts generated, I gave up and asked ChatGPT, who gave me an annoyingly perfect categorization: ‘so that’ refers to purpose or intention, while ‘such that’ refers to a condition or exact criteria to be met. For example, “I cooked so that I could feed all my friends” implies that the purpose is to feed all my friends, while “I cooked such that I could feed all my friends” implies that I made so much food that I satisfy the condition of being able to feed all my friends, but not necessarily that I intend to do so. Usually this nuance doesn’t matter, though. Just say ‘so that’… 5/10

n, where n is…

Example: “There are like… n mushrooms… where n is a small number” Translation: “There’s not a lot of mushrooms” Explanation: I simply have no explanation, and was *this* close to throwing said mushrooms at this person. -100/10

signal-to-noise ratio

Example: “My brain’s signal to noise ratio is very low” Translation: “If I have any useful thoughts, they’re generally drowned out by the incessant muttering of my inner demons” \hj Explanation: ‘Signal-to-noise ratio’ is a measurement of the strength of a signal to the strength of its background noise. For example, the further away you are from a radio station, the more your signal-to-noise-ratio drops and the harder it is to make out the music (signal) amidst the static (noise). I’m actually quite partial to this one–it’s so poetic. 10/10

In this case, the noise is “as big” as the sinusoidal signal, making the combination of the two difficult to make out

magnitude

the magnitude of a vector <a, b, c> can be calculated with the Pythagorean Theorem!

Example: “I wish there were more people with Ellie-magnitude personalities” Translation: “I wish there were more people with personalities as large/fun/cool as Ellie” (name replaced) Explanation: In technical use, ‘magnitude’ refers to the size of something, and is often denoted as the absolute value. I don’t actually hear this one very often (besides in “this is orders of magnitude better than expected” cases), but I thought it was funny.

critical mass

Example: “We have reached critical mass to start class” Translation: “We have enough people here that it makes sense to start class” Explanation: In nuclear physics, critical mass is the minimum amount of material needed to keep a nuclear reaction alive. It’s a pretty good phrase for social situations, because you often need a minimum number of people to make things happen. Probably not as unique to nerd world, though. 7/10

pigeonhole principle

Example: “I’m grading this question alone–we have 8 people for 5 questions, so by pigeonhole…” Translation: “We have 8 people for 5 questions, so there have to be at least 2 questions that only have 1 grader each.” Explanation: According to Wikipedia, the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. It’s mainly common sense (if you have 3 pigeons and 2 holes, at least 1 hole has to have more than 1 pigeon), but it’s often used in proofs. I’ve somehow heard this come up in more than one conversation–in fact, a friend who was also present for this example anticipated where it was going and CHIMED IN SIMULTANEOUSLY with “by pigeonhole” 😭.  2/10

*coo coo*

parallelize

Example: ”Let’s parallelize–you chop the cabbage while I caramelize the onions” Translation: “Let’s split up the tasks that can be done simultaneously–” Explanation: In computer science, parallel processing is when you use multiple processors to do different parts of a job. In particular, though, the mini-tasks must not depend on each other–i.e. chopping cabbage doesn’t require that onions first be caramelized, or vice versa. There’s no real purpose to using ‘parallelize,’ but I think parallel processing is a cool concept, and I think it’s useful to remind ourselves that we have to work on tasks that don’t depend on each other. 9/10

intersection

Example: “When I cook, I usually just take the intersection of a bunch of recipes” 
        – my roommate, making the best food I’ve ever eaten because she is amazing and also my hero
      
Translation: “I usually look at a bunch of recipes and use the ingredients mentioned by all of them” Explanation: In math, the ‘intersection’ of two groups is all the items that fall in both groups. For example, apples are in the intersection of [fruits] and [red things], because they’re both fruits and red things. My friend used ‘intersection’ to mean exactly this, and I actually quite like it. If you know the other person will understand it, it saves several words and a convoluted explanation. 9/10

A is multiples of 2, B is multiples of 3, and the intersection is multiples of 6 :D

honorable mentions: tongue-in-cheek references to anything machine learning

Example: My friend, walking down a hill: “gradient descent!!!!” Translation: “We’re going down a hill!!!”

Example: “He’s updating his weights!!” Translation: “He’s changing his opinions/understanding after hearing us talk!”(?)

Example: “I need more training data to understand this >:(” Translation: “I need more practice problems/examples/experiences”

Explanation: I’m not competent enough to actually explain all this machine learning stuff, so uhhh if you’re curious the 3Blue1Brown videos are a great intro. Suffice to say, we’ve started talking about ourselves as machine learning models… The lure of computer science has sunk its talons into us, and it’s begun to draw blood. Send help. 4/10

dishonorable mention: in which i am the culprit

Example: 
My roommate: “Late days exist for a reason” Me: “This is a true statement” Me: *realizes what I just said* Me: *pitches self out the nearest window* Translation: “Yeah” Explanation: Before coming to MIT, I would say ‘ah yeah that’s true…’ occasionally, but I’d never heard anyone except my mom say ‘this is true.’ Unfortunately, however, ‘this is true’ is SO common here, and I’ve resigned myself to falling victim. BUT STILL. I genuinely can’t believe that the words ‘this is a true statement’ passed my lips completely unironically… I suppose even I, a non-math person, am susceptible to the allure of mathisms. Either that or the 
        6.121

How I lost aura points,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",5,2024-11-14T00:00:00-05:00,"The state that I have been reduced to

For people who aren’t caught up with Gen Zalpha slang, or people who are reading this in the far future, or people who time-travelled from a year before 2024: “Aura points” dictate how cool you are. You gain aura points when you do something cool and socially confident, and you lose points when you do something cringe. I unfortunately lost a handful of aura points in the past several days.

I lied to someone’s parents

It was
        Family Weekend
      
 about a week ago (a few weeks ago, by the time this gets posted), starting last Friday. I forgot it was happening. When two parents asked me if Next House had breakfast, I thought they were random women for some reason and said that it was only for students. [-200 aura]

Daylight Saving Time

For some reason, the shift in daylight savings threw my circadian rhythm out of whack. A few months ago, I was easily putting in efficient work before my bed time. Lately, I’ve been spending at least half of that time watching Please Don’t Destroy videos [+50 aura] because my brain is too sleepy to think, but too awake to fall asleep. [-100 aura]

Showing my age

I used the slang word “slay” in a conversation the other day. [-250 aura]

Pigeons

I’m taking 21W.744: The Art of Comic Book Writing, which is probably my favorite 
        HASS
      
 class I’ve taken so far. For this week’s assignment we had to submit a pitch for six different story ideas that we’ll pick from for our final project. And honestly? My first five pitches were kind of fire.

But then I had no idea what to do for my last pitch. I decided to follow the sage advice: Write what you know.

I decided this story was going to take place in Boston. What happens in Boston? Revolutions. Beer. Pigeons. At 3 a.m., I wrote a synopsis for a story where American revolutionaries Samuel Adams and John Hancock got reincarnated as pigeons who live in modern-day downtown Boston. I was really proud of myself, and it was also the only kid-friendly pitch in the entire document.

I submitted my groundbreaking contribution to American literature, only to wake up with dread when I realized that my professor was actually going to read this. [-1500 aura] Also, I learned later that John Hancock owned slaves. [-5000 aura]

Pants

Last weekend, I painted sets for MIT Shakespeare Ensemble’s production of Macbeth. I had a blast! Clocked in at 9 a.m. and had dinner with some of the crew at 6 p.m.

It wasn’t until three days later that I found out that my black pants had lavender paint on the butt, and I have no idea how long it must’ve been there. [-500 aura]

Cringe

Since August, I’ve been trying to convince Fatima that the joke “Cambridge? More like Cringebridge” is 
        extremely funny.

“what if I get rejected”,Aiden H. '28,9,2024-11-13T00:00:00-05:00,"I’ll cut to the chase: it’s November, which means that a lot of the people stumbling across the blogs are among the tens of thousands of anxious students and family members who are going through the college application season, and are either trying to vibe out whether they want to apply to MIT, or they already have and now must wait a grueling amount of time to figure out their admission status.

Essentially, nausea is in the crisp autumn air for a lot of you.

And,
        as an elder now,
      
 I can tell you that I was nauseous once, too. But as a self-confirmed psychic, the tragic fate I had predicted for myself had unfortunately come true.

This is how I got rejected from my “dream school”, and how I got into this one.

***

Throughout middle school and high school, one of my best friends and I had a pact: go to Stanford. We famously donned matching Stanford hoodies together and became annoyingly giddy at the mention of anything Stanford related. I left it to her to decide why, exactly. My younger ears knew that it was a very prestigious school in sunny California, and I was sold. My “dream school” had been decided, an unknown blood oath I had taken to extort myself for the next five years towards an ambiguous goal of being a college student not just anywhere, but at a very specific college (if it sounds ridiculous written out bluntly, that’s because it is).

It’s not as if I didn’t want to go to Stanford initially, but the attachment solidified as years of romanticization played out over my Google tabs as I looked at classes I could take, majors I could choose, and dorms I could live in. Some people around me–my mom who went to her state school where she was guaranteed automatic admission, friends who were only applying to CSU a mile up the road–initially thought our commitment to Stanford was stupid. I find this sentiment troubling. To the extent that we want to inspire younger generations to always go after their dreams and simultaneously put so much pressure on higher education, it’s only natural that high schoolers begin to subscribe to the mentality that a college is one of the most important factors in their future. It’s not stupid to feel passionate about a process you but so much of yourself into. 

So when the summer before senior year hit, I was nothing more than a floating body trying to find the creative will to write application essays. The first thing I learned? I’m awful at lying. While I tried to turn every prompt into a story about self-growth and perseverance, everyone I had peer review the essays saw right through it. I’m naturally very pessimistic, so it was as if someone took a Disney Channel version of my real personality and plastered it across the page with words stolen from Thesaurus.com.

This was my worst nightmare. I had to be the ideal, happiest, most developed 17 year old that Stanford had ever seen, radiating nothing but joy and optimism and intelligence that I could uniquely bring to their campus. Except I have never in my life had enough self-confidence to be optimistic or believe that I truly had something to bring to the table. This was especially true when I forced myself into
        the rabbit hole of college-applications YouTube.
      
 My application to Stanford felt like the most unrealistic goal I had, but also the one I put the most pressure on.

College applications are hard because they are simultaneously the most intense and the most fabricated self-reflection you’ve probably done. It’s not every year that we are forced to reexamine ourselves to ask if we are good enough not just for a school or a job, but a lifestyle that is being sold to us.

I eventually submitted my application feeling less than okay about it, and then the gaslighting came. I understand that, yet again, this is the optimism I always fail to see, but the incessant reassurance from everyone I know “that you’re definitely getting in!” just increased the pressure. With how and where I grew up, I was never expected to necessarily “go far” by traditional measures of success. So when I decided I would try, it felt like I had something to prove. Now that everyone believed this mirage I had put up, it had to stay, when really nobody but me cared.

Next was the interview. As both a people pleaser and someone trying to be accommodating to the person who could decide the fate of my application, I skipped class to drive 20 minutes to a coffee shop on the CSU campus. We sat outside despite heavy winds, which I insisted were fine because the interviewer wanted to sit there.


        It was awful.
      
 I normally don’t have interview anxiety or difficulty talking to adults, but I sobbed in my car for an hour after and called my friend to tell her that there was no way we were both getting in anymore. It already felt like the life I had desired for the past 5 years was being stripped from me without my control.

At that point I thought my chances were pretty low. Still, for the week before decisions were released, my head was foggy and my anxiety was spiking. My friend and I were at a debate tournament in Cheyenne the day they came out, which both helped and hurt the process. They were released a 6:00 P.M., immediately before we had to go argue about federal student loans. I knew I would feel better if I could immediately be distracted after, so I opened it immediately. My friend knew for a fact that, despite how much it killed her putting it off longer, she had to wait until we were leaving the tournament so that she could find out alone.

Neither of us got in.

***

What people don’t really talk about past their disappointment of getting rejected is how much the pity stings. In an instant everyone around me switched their tune from “you’re destined for Stanford, the greatest school in the world” to “that stupid school doesn’t deserve you anyway”. Whether or whether not either is true, it still felt weird.

What else people don’t talk about is how lonely it feels, putting yourself out there to be judged by an anonymous panel only to be rejected. The process can echo a lot of insecurities we already hold for ourselves, forcing us to trace a mental list of every way we think we don’t compare, asking what reason it was we don’t deserve something we wanted. I am a deeply regretful and nostalgic person. To my core I feel the weight of every decision and life path constantly weighing on me, the heaviness of not getting what I want sits like an anvil on my chest.

But at some point, time has to move on.

One of my debate coaches used her phone to draw over the Dean of Admission’s face with crude images, and I guess that was the first step to moving on. Step two was repeating the process, another dozen times in the 30 days left I had left to submit applications. Because just like any dream, if you lose it you must find another. And I did that by applying to every other school I could in order to compensate for what I felt like I lost. When you plan everything out so intensely, every other path, even the better ones, seems like settling for the life you decided on. But as I eventually began researching other colleges, I noticed something: they’re all the same.

Okay, they’re not all the same, but in the aspects I thought mattered they are. Lot of studies show that it is not what school you go to that determines how successful or happy you are, but the general work ethic and accomplishments you have that make you “qualified” to attend prestigious schools. Anything hyper-specific about one school you can create for yourself at another. The only thing that does change are the location and the name–everything else is what you make it to be. I noticed everything I had admired at Stanford exists in some form at another school–schools like MIT (among others, of course).

Before I found out about Stanford, I hadn’t really thought about applying to MIT. The same friend was planning to apply, so I decided to make an application on the website and put it on the back end, only completing it if I had extra time. That “extra time” turned out to mean I didn’t open the application again until noon the day it was due. I didn’t have a lot of time to create entirely new essays, so I reworded some I had used for other schools and sent it in.

It was only after I applied that I truly started to discover what MIT had for me. I never thought I would get in, but I went down YouTube spirals watching cheesy
        “Day In My Life At MIT” vlogs
      
 and read a backlog of blog content anyway. From January to March, MIT transformed from one of the schools I wasn’t going to apply into one of my top choices. Even then (though I swore I wouldn’t attach myself to one school), 
        MIT wasn’t atop the mental ranking I had made of the rest of the schools I applied to.
      


It turns out I got into some I wanted. I also got rejected from 9 others. And while of course there was excitement, committing is still a tolling process, no matter where you go. It’s officially turning away from what feels like every other life you could’ve had. But what people forget is that you are smart enough and capable enough to be able to do well in more than one environment.

Right now, I am taking probably the same classes with the same demographics of people that I would at almost any other school. And while my life will differ because of the minute details, my “college lifestyle” per se is not something that was bequeathed to me during orientation week, something that only comes from the soil of Killian Court. If you are passionate enough to even apply for a place like MIT, you are 100% going to be fine, even if not at MIT.

I’m not going to tell you that it doesn’t hurt, but I will tell you that you’re strong enough to get over it, however long it takes. And I do still think about Stanford, but definitely less. Like all pain, it doesn’t go away, but instead escapes into the background for you to move on.

I know that if on the day I got rejected from Stanford a student wrote to me saying “You’re going to do great things! Just not here babe :( “, I would have immediately punched them in the throat as violently as possible without remorse. I also know that when I meet people now who have gone to Stanford, I just ask how they like it, have a mini-daydream about “what if I went there”, and then move on because I probably have a pset to do for the college I actually attend. I also know that there are people reading this who will get into Stanford and not MIT.

Some of you will get to live out my “dream”, I might be living out yours. But at some point when you look back on wherever you’ve been, your dream will be going back to what you had and not what you didn’t.

So just breathe, take a nap, eat a sandwich, and make a mood board or something until

I tried* to run to the airport,Kayode D. '27,4,2024-11-12T00:00:00-05:00,"I wrote in an earlier blog that I took up running. Since coming back to MIT, I am sad to report that the habit has ceased and I no longer run everyday.

I realized recently that I lack discipline. I’ve been burnt by the burn-out of too much work to do and I steer clear at the first sign of stress or discomfort. This usually looks like me spending too much time on youtube or (if i’m feeling particularly productive) a descent in wikipedia rabbitholes [three cool rabbitholes i found: marathons  and judo, football, and board games].

My friend, 
        Bry
      
, recently told me she bought tickets to run in the Cambridge Half Marathon, but was no longer able to run it, so she wanted to sell the tickets. This seemed like a great way to build disciple! The race was a month out, which gave me just enough time to train, I thought. If I really buckled down it would be hard, but I’d be able to do it.

So did I look up training plans or strategies on how to get my distance up? Nope. I went for a 5 mile run to test out the waters:



My big plan was to go running with other runners who knew tips and how to conserve energy. My technique is bad and I tend to burn out wayyy too fast. If I start to feel tired I speed up so I can get to “that tree up there” which becomes “that intersection” and then “that building” and I keep pushing back my finish line in an attempt to build a stronger character or something. I just care about my character development too much, ya know?

Anyways, the run is simple: run through BU, run through Newbury Street (or rather, the street parallel to it b/c i would get distracted by 
         newbury comics
      
), and then back up by chipotle to get to Simmons. ~5 miles.

Everything started out good. I left Sunday night at like 6:30 when the sun was still out but starting to set, and really enjoyed the run. So much so that I missed my turn. By a lot. I kept thinking i could get back on track if I just stayed on the path I was going, and I was having so much fun! I was going to run a HALF MARATHON!! I live in BOSTON!! This is so freaking cool!!



And by the time I finally stopped to figure out where I was I realized something. I was now equidistant from MIT… and the Airport. I should probably head back, but how FUNNY would it be if I ran to the airport? I could run there, take a funny picture like “how did I get here?” and then take the train back to MIT. So I look at it on google maps real quick [FORESHADOWING] to make sure it was possible, and keep running. I ran though the downtown part of Boston, through the footpaths and plazas. I saw a concert happening and tons of shops and restaurants. It truly was a grand old time.

Then I got to the docks.

And realized that there’s no bridge.

There isn’t a bridge from the mainland to the island that Boston Logan Airport is on. The line on Google Maps was a ferry it wanted me to take. But take a boat just to take a train back? I might as well just run home and keep running! So that’s what I did. Until I looked at my map again:



NOW, I was equidistant from MIT and the airport if i ran around the LONG way. And so I did. Because I had runners high and I’m an idiot.

Eventually I get a call from my friend, Sydney (MA Resident), who asks when I’ll be back at Simmons. Unbeknownst to her, I was on the journey of a lifetime, to THE Boston Logan International Airport…on foot. I told her what I was up to, and she showed concern. Like a lot of concern. It was dark and night. But I was FINE, I told her. I was almost to the bridge, and then it’s a clear shot to the airport train station.

And as I’m on the phone with her I reach the bridge and realize…it’s a tunnel. A tunnel for cars.



But now I’ve gone too deep. I have to get to the airport now. I don’t want to give up. I have a fire in my blood and by golly I’m going to see that sweet sweet tarmac if it’s the last thing I do. So I recalculate and plan to run across…the next bridge. Or maybe the next one? I share my location with Sydney and get to running.

This is where it stopped being fun. I wasn’t in the populated plazas anymore, I was just on some street. Like it was still a well lit street, but it wasn’t really enjoyable anymore. I was just running now because I had to, not because I wanted to. Eventually I get a call from my roommate, Noah (another Bostonian). Sydney has told him my Great Plan, and he was not an enthused as I had hoped.

“Kayode, you can’t run to the airport. The city is literally designed that way,” he said.

“Keep the SAME ENERGY when it happens,” I told him confidently. “There’s a bridge on the north end, I can make it.”

“Just come home, we’re already proud of you, you ran like 6 miles, just come home.”

“Ok, but how much more proud will you be when I run all the way to the airport?”

“Honestly, I’ll think you’re an even bigger idiot if you keep running. It won’t make me any more proud of you.”

 

And then I had to stop. What was I doing? Why was I so determined to run to the airport? Through an unknown area in an unknown city at NIGHT. Suddenly the reality of the danger I was about to put myself through sank in. It would be more than an hour until I reached the airport. I needed to go home.

And so go home I did. I ran to the Orange Line and road the train back to MIT. I have not run since.

…

I shared this story in a blogger meeting, to which Petey (Resident Bostonian) showed immediate and intense concern with me going through that area of Boston. He wanted to be very clear that I should NOT run across the Chelsea Bridge at night, ever. It’s the site of some real bad things that have happened, and wouldn’t be a fun time.

So now I have shared this cautionary tale with all of you.

Moral of the story: Don’t try to run to the airport, or to any unknown location, much less at night.

map of good places to run

There are lots of great, safe places to run in Boston, and until I started to leave those areas I was having tons of fun!! Hopefully I can get back into it when it gets warmer but for now, 
        I’ll stick to staying indoors and psetting
      
 😭😭😭.

Note from while editing: I started running again. I think i just got spooked out of it. Editing this reminded me of a passage of scripture that I just went to re-read (1 Corinthians 9: 24-27). It’s in part of a letter from the apostle Paul to the Church of Corinth, and he talks about running races and running in a way is if to win, but ALSO not running like a man running aimlessly (me) or fighting like a man beating the air, but to do it so as to work towards winning the spiritual race. I need to run as if to win this spiritual / literal race. Maybe I’ll try for the Charlie Card Challenge?","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/is-there-a-name-for-the-disintegrating-emoji-v0-91z9dlqeat5c1-400x400.gif

If I ever come back,CJ Q. '23,4,2024-11-12T00:00:00-05:00,"Cross-posted from my blog, which is where I write these days.

One

If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay? I don’t know If I can keep going down this road

If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay? I don’t know If I can keep going down this road

At the beginning of senior year, I began tackling the question on my final final exam: What happens next?

Decision-making is a skill. Like many skills, there’s a body of knowledge, scattered in decision theory textbooks, rationality blog posts, and sappy screeds about choosing where to go to college. Like many skills, there’s a gap between knowing and working, a gap exacerbated by the fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding big choices. Unlike many skills, there’s not opportunities to practice, as the life decisions are distant, and the feedback cycles are lengthy. Many scenarios are similar, but none are the same; the contexts are simply too different.

All this to say: for me, choosing what to do after college was easier than choosing where to go for college. But only a little easier.

Let’s simplify this decision. Should I do an MEng or not? Should I spend another year or two in MIT and get another degree, or should I leave Boston and work in industry? Never mind the question of what industry I’ll work in; this decision alone was already plenty difficult.

To theory, then. In software engineering, we have a whole toolkit to make changes with confidence. Regression tests prevent you from repeating past mistakes. Feature gates let you quickly switch between code paths. Database backups help you recover after a bad migration. Confidence comes when you’re certain that your changes are correct, and it comes when you have easy ways to revert issues.

Can I run regression tests? No, the previous contexts are too different to make useful generalizations from. Can I add feature gates? That would mean living two lives in parallel, and only making a decision after seeing the results. Can I make backups? Maybe if I could immerse MIT in stasis, leave, and hope it’s exactly the same when I come back. So much for theory, then.

Stay with MIT, or leave MIT. Choose one, knowing that the action of choosing will change me in an unpredictable way. If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay?

Oh, said I wasn’t ready Didn’t think it’d be this heavy, let me Explain myself I’m the same but help The pain I held, the shame I felt, I made you tell I listened but my pessimistic brain don’t help, ooh If I could put it on a shelf, I would If I could explain myself, I would

Let me explain myself: I chose MIT because it was what I needed.

It’s a bit transactional to put it that way, but it’s true. I needed a degree, an education, and a ticket to raise my status. I needed a community, or two, or three; I needed places and people I could call home. I needed to learn the feeling of fitting in somewhere long-term; I needed stability. I needed to get my heart broken in new ways. I didn’t know I needed these things, but I got them, and MIT was instrumental in filling these holes.

Let me explain myself: I left MIT because it isn’t what I need.

I don’t think I’ve gotten everything I could out of MIT; that’d take many lifetimes. Rather, I was running into diminishing returns, partly due to learning less, partly due to feeling less. Toward the end of my undergrad, I often felt unmoored from my activities. Sure, I’d already decided that I wasn’t doing an MEng, but I think I would’ve felt the same no matter what. I needed a change, and staying with MIT, even staying in Boston, wouldn’t give me enough of it, even accounting for how MIT will change.

Then again: did I leave MIT because it will be better for me? Am I ignoring why I chose MIT long ago? No. The lesson from that choice was to think about what matters to me, and to trust my own assessment for what matters, even if it doesn’t line up with what others think. The decisions never lay with others, they lay with me.

What matters to me, then? I was stuck on this years ago, but I have a better idea now. While I haven’t had this exact decision before, I can test my thoughts against similar experiences, so I can avoid repeating past mistakes. From doing a UROP, I learned how important internal motivation was. From doing an internship, I learned how important becoming a better programmer was.

Now a pessimistic brain might be thinking: Of course these things are important. That’s like saying you value excellence, or respect, or community. And that’d be right. Without explanation, a value is contentless. No, the value of a value lies in its trade-offs. The value of a value lies in how it guides decision-making.

Valuing internal motivation means saying no to projects I’m not excited about, even if I have other good reasons to work on them. It means that if I run out of internal motivation, I need to spend time finding it, else, I quit. Valuing becoming better means saying yes to projects at the edge of my skills, even if it opens the possibility of failing. It means keeping a project I’m struggling with if I’m learning, even if it means missing a deadline or sacrificing quality.

I hope there’s still a next time, next time My prayer isn’t really doing me good I promise I’ll be ready for you next time If I could grow up in a day, I would Come back tomorrow

Since graduation, I’ve come back to Boston five times, but it was only the latest visit that prompted me to write this post, as it was only in the latest visit that I was possessed by the strangest feeling, when I stepped onto campus from the Kendall/MIT station, an unbearable lightness lifting the hairs of my back, intensifying the more I walked, and it was then when I realized I’ve felt this before:

[…] I came into this whole mess getting ready to be sad. It’s like, you know when you’re going up stairs, and you take a step, expecting there to be more staircase, when there’s nothing but air? And then you kinda have to wobble for a bit before you lower your foot, as if you don’t really believe there’s solid ground that’s going to catch you.

[…] I came into this whole mess getting ready to be sad. It’s like, you know when you’re going up stairs, and you take a step, expecting there to be more staircase, when there’s nothing but air? And then you kinda have to wobble for a bit before you lower your foot, as if you don’t really believe there’s solid ground that’s going to catch you.

A stairstep that exists in the mind but not in the world: that image made sense. Walking through MIT felt like walking through two worlds at once. The Green Building is in permanent construction, a dorm room in East Campus never gathers dust, the Stud stays drab and dim. Looking at these places, these places splitting at the seams with incongruence, filled me with—something. The postlude to the lightness. It wasn’t sadness. It wasn’t grief, because I know what grief feels like:

[…T]hat’s what I’m feeling now. Grief. Grief for my undergraduate years, back in MIT, and all the rosy parts of it. Grieving because I’ve lost something precious. Not a person or an object or a place or a moment, but their combination.

[…T]hat’s what I’m feeling now. Grief. Grief for my undergraduate years, back in MIT, and all the rosy parts of it. Grieving because I’ve lost something precious. Not a person or an object or a place or a moment, but their combination.

No, the feeling was quieter than that. Not as pointed, but still uncomfortable. Mildly painful, but a pain I could live with. There’s no longing attached to it, other than the want to stop feeling it.

The other day I started watching Log Log Land, and I was once again overtaken by this feeling; the first five minutes were fine, but then the setting started switching from one dorm room to another, each filled with people, studying or talking or hanging out, and it was then that the feeling became so strong I had to stop watching and collect myself.

And no, the feeling wasn’t negative. There was a small note of vicarious pride. Contentment in seeing others live in places I’ve loved. All that, undercut by diluted envy. The thought wouldn’t it be nice, so weak it was silent:

Wouldn’t it be nice, being a student again?

It would. But that’s not my life to live anymore.

Wouldn’t it be nice, having dozens of friends a few doors down the hall?

It would. But that’s not what I’m going to get.

Wouldn’t it be nice, living in Boston, visiting MIT often?

It would. But that’s not the same. It wouldn’t satisfy me.

And how would I know, if I don’t experience it?

I don’t. I don’t know. It’s not like I can live two lives in parallel,

and only make the decision after seeing the result?

That ball of feelings, tangled up like yarn, that mild pain, that small vicarious pride, that little contentment, that diluted envy; all of these pointed to the passage of time, the cycle of growing up and leaving, the awareness that others will grow up and leave; all of these added up to a sensitivity to ephemerality, to transience, to next time, next time.

Something like mono no aware, perhaps.

That visit, when I ate with friends, I avoided eating on campus. That visit, when I worked, I went to coffee shops, not the libraries. That visit was shorter than my previous four visits, and part of me wished it was even shorter.

It hurt, being in MIT, without being of MIT.

Four

If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay? I don’t know if I can keep going down this road If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay? I don’t know if I can keep going down this road

If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay? I don’t know if I can keep going down this road If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay? I don’t know if I can keep going down this road

Who’s singing to whom here?

From MIT’s perspective, I didn’t leave it, it left me. It’s always moving with the merciless speed of institutional change. It would take all my speed to keep up with it, and by then I wouldn’t have enough to go elsewhere.

Movement is always relative. There are no stillnesses: you’re always moving with respect to something. Even if you’re stuck somewhere, you’re moving with that place, and if that place is stuck somewhere, it’s moving with the earth. (Why would you ever want to move faster? Is hurtling around the sun not enough of a miracle for you?)

Long before we learn this principle of relativity, we learn counterfactual thinking, we learn decentration, we learn perspective-taking, we learn a theory of mind, we learn object permanence. These are cognitive capacities about things outside ourselves, because, apparently, growing up is about destroying egocentricity.

Is it fair, then, for me to whine about my pain of being apart from MIT, when MIT could be in as much pain being apart from me? I know, it’s ridiculous, thinking of places as having emotions. But it’s not like MIT is immersed in stasis when I’m not there. It’s not frozen like a photograph. It continues moving, flowing, pulsing, breathing.

Imagine seeing thousands of people come and leave every semester, like leaves that grow and fall every season. Would it not break you? Or would you get used to it?

Five

Don’t think the silence between us Means that I can’t care less I’m careless, in fairness I’m unsure if like you But I’m sure that I love you, so spare us This inevitability, can I come back with a higher probability? I hope you don’t forget I got a hole in my chest In the shape of your heart, but it just don’t fit yet

I hope you don’t forget I got a hole in my chest In the shape of your heart, but it just don’t fit yet

My memory of graduation is, I’m certain, false. It’s silent but for the reading of names and the intermittent applause. I remember lining up to get onto the stage, walking down after getting my diploma, and a smash cut between. A subtle act, graduating. Ostensibly, it happens in the moment you’re declared a graduate. But if, after you graduate, you’re no longer an undergrad—then graduation has to be a much, much longer process.

Everything they say about distance and hearts and fondness is trash. The time I’ve spent apart only makes it easier to move on. The want to have fulfilling work, the want to be around good friends, the want to create beautiful things, these are holes MIT used to fill. Now, I have to put in more work to fill these holes, because there’s no longer a single thing that ticks all the boxes.

And I knew, I knew couldn’t keep relying on MIT to fill these holes. Because MIT (the place, and the things, and the people associated) and I are moving in different directions. Because using MIT (the place, the things, and the people) to fill that hole brings some contentment, but also, some pain.

Because, above all, I don’t want to be the person who overstays their welcome. I don’t want to be the person who can’t live in the present. I don’t want to be the person who thinks the best days of their life are behind them. I don’t want to be the person who, years after graduating, holds on to the places, things, and people from their undergraduate years.

Because, after all, I’ve graduated. That means I can’t be an undergrad any more. And it’s easier to throw something away wholesale, than it is to only throw away the parts you don’t want anymore. And the only way I can get rid of this nagging pain and these cloying wants is to leave it all behind.

Right?

No, the answer isn’t to leave everything behind, because starting fresh doesn’t have to mean starting over. I don’t have to be within MIT for MIT to be within me.

No, the answer isn’t to get rid of the pain. Didn’t I say earlier that the feeling isn’t all negative? Ephemerality begets beauty; that’s the reason cherry blossoms are valued. Nostalgia is a positive emotional experience, one of those rare cognitive psychology findings that replicates.

No, the answer isn’t to deny MIT. The answer can’t be to deny MIT. It was a huge part of my life. It’s four whole years! There’s no reason it can’t still be a part. A smaller part, maybe, but a part nonetheless. I can’t leave behind the tens of classes I’ve taken, the hundreds of friends I’ve made, the thousands of lines of code I’ve written, the tens of thousands of hours I’ve spent on campus, the hundreds of thousands of words I’ve written for the admissions blogs, the millions of things I’ve loved and hated again and again, and the innumerable measure I’ve gained besides.

If I ever come back, I hope you’ll still be here If I ever come back, if I ever come back If I ever come back, please don’t disappear If I ever come back, if I ever come back

If I ever come back, I hope you’ll still be here If I ever come back, if I ever come back If I ever come back, please don’t disappear If I ever come back, if I ever come back

At last, the song drops the title.

In my last visit, I went to Tech Squares, and it was the first night of that semester’s PE class. Ted, our club caller, instructed the class members on proper handholds. “A gentle touch is enough,” he said. “Don’t leave any DNA when you let go.”

It’s one of the things he says every semester. People laughed. Mostly the newcomers. I laughed with them, for a different reason.

I left Boston the next day. I remember walking from campus to South Station, as I had the time to burn. I walked across the Harvard Bridge. I found myself thinking about what Ted said. I’ve probably left lots of DNA in MIT, through fallen hair or dead skin. I’ve left many other things too. Stuffed toys I’ve given away, signatures I’ve written in yearbooks, knick-knacks I’ve donated to floor lounges. Class projects I’ve created. Student groups I’ve poured hours of my life into. Friends I’ve made, even when I knew our time was bounded.

Many of these things will disappear. But if I ever come back—and I will, I promise—I hope that some of these things will still be here.

If I ever come back, I hope you’ll still be here.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-tDL1LlJew,1

welcome to today’s episode of 
        m*thbusters!
      
 today, we’re clearing out some classic misconceptions that you may hold about Bloggers, Boston, and the Great Beyond. 

claim: mit students grind all day and do nothing but studying

fact: we work hard, but we do a lot of other things too! eating, crying over problem sets, and idk like the 200+ clubs that exist at mit need to have people running them or something

claim: boston weather sucks  

fact: well, only a little bit if you’re not used to not seeing the sun every day (yes looking at you tropical climate enjoyers). there are also very lovely clear days with 
        70 degrees
      
 weather, as you will soon see :) 


         claim: the bloggers are a collective hivemind who hang out every week and all live together and are besties 
      


fact: so like, technically not true. we have a surprising number of 
        blogger roommates
      
 which is very cool, but many of us only see the others at blogger meetings and occasionally wave hi in the corridors. 

however, this does not stop us from trying to make the claim into a fact. Angie F. ‘28, Ellie F. ‘28 and i were talking the other day about how the bloggers are actually really cool and based and it was kinda sad how we didn’t really all know each other that well. therefore, because we are energetic independent college students who tAke AgEnCy with our lives, we decided to organise a blogger hangout! and this is the point when we cut off our short-lived episode of m*thbusters and bust out the party music because WELCOME TO BLOGSTON COMMONS EP. 1 EVERYONE!!! 🎉🎉🎉

it began, as many MIT things do, with a when2meet.



in true mit fashion, this attempt turns out to become 13 people filling out the when2meet, a slot that only 
        11 people
      
 said they could tentatively make, and ended up with 5 people who actually met up at Kendall square to do our scheduled hangout idea. honestly this is probably a record retention rate already

we’re ready to go!

organising hangouts is hard. finding an activity to do is also hard. thankfully, we share the common theme of being bloggers who have experience with yapping about random stuff, so after some consideration we decided to do a little race where we will blog all the way to 
        boston commons 
      
and back, and call it a day. the day was crisp, the skies were clear, and the bloggers were BLOGGING!  

i had planned out a google doc of logistics the day before. due to 
        A Series of Unfortunate Events 
      
 we had to uphaul most of the logistics and play it by ear. what we did have were some random ideas that i threw down as random blog prompts the day before, so we took these ideas and kinda ran (or trained???) with them. 

boston commons came much earlier than expected, so we rushed out of the traincar at the last moment like manic wolves. we found a nice bench with a bunch of squirrels nearby that kept on 
        distracting us,
      
 but were successfully able to lock in on the park bench and slam out our blogs.

sooooo locked in

jebby was the first to finish. actually, she was so based she finished a prelim version about 5 minutes after getting off the train (which was maybe like 15 minutes total??), but it was so wrought with shaky train-based typos that 
        she had to fix* those before the post was fit for publishing. (*read annotation please)
      
 fortunately, she had a slam-dunk margin on the rest of us so she decided to spend most of her victory lap drawing sad faces on MS paint (which you can marvel at in her blog). 

ms paint in progress (D:)

i finished second; i think once i took my blog a lot less seriously i was able to churn out words at the same pace at which i used to bs in debate speeches and essays about roman mythologies. is it quality? like, no, absolutely not. was it quantity? yes, enough for me to get second place. i also had to do a lot of revising after my first round of word vomit though. i spent the rest of the time marvelling at the squirrels on the street. 

ellie was a very close third. aside from the squirrel distractions i think she was very consistent in the pace at which she was writing. i think this also shows in the impressive cohesion of her blog when compared to mine and jebby’s, so i think she wins on combined quality and speed ☠️

ellie finished!

after this point all of us were getting a little cold because apparently the sunny day could not compensate for the wind chills. i decided to take us to bakey, a really cute bakery that’s super close to commons! people have apparently not been there so i got us a yummy strawberry broissant and cinnamon babka. delicious, especially when piping hot on a wintery day. 

we continued editing blogs and frantically writing them, but eventually ellie and sara had to dip to other commitments, and then jebby also had to leave to, and i approximately quote, “take a nap because [she] 
        haven’t slept since yesterday oops.”
      
 (*also corrected in annotation) sara and allison fully finished their blogs later (on a timer still for the sake of the game :P), but at this point we were ready to go.

allison and i were both planning on getting friends flowers for the concert choir performance that we were going to watch that night, so we walked to the trader joes in boylston and bought flowers + misc other groceries. we then walked all the way back to mit because it was a jobless saturday afternoon for the both of us and we wanted to enjoy the view. boston was glowing that day :)

boston is so beautiful sometimes

of course, this is only primarily my side of the story, so we shall let the writers speak for themselves about what they thought about blogston commons. without further ado, i welcome our blogston commons participants to give their own thoughts and reflection on their blogs!

winner: jebby 

To be clear, I was completely sober while I was writing. All I cared about was being the fastest person to write a blog post, not a good blog post.

I chose the prompt “Write about a useless fact” for two reasons:

- I know many useless facts, so it would take minimal energy to come up with something to write about.

- I usually overthink when I write. I fuss over details and rewrite the same sentence in five different ways. I’m the kind of person who edits my messages at least twice. I picked a prompt that wasn’t personal, so I wouldn’t waste time worrying about how to convey a thought that actually means something to me.

I already had MS Word pulled up on my laptop. The second we started, I just pulled out any unfiltered thought and blasted them all over the page. I was quite successful, being the first person to hit 500 words.

But, winning came with a cost. I have autocorrect turned off, and my accuracy drops significantly when I type too fast, which really shows in the final product. For the last several hours, I’ve had to carry the burden of first-hand embarrassment that comes with committing to the bit too hard. I bet there was a high schooler out there who was scrolling eagerly through the MIT blogs, only to see my post-modernist Ulysses-esque rambling about Boston history, and quietly decided never to step foot on MIT’s campus.

This is what a winner looks like, whether you like it or not.

second place: janet

idk i feel like i’ve said enough on this post LOL in all honesty i was not prepared to choose a topic at all so after i said i would do dinner conversations i regretted my decision for a solid 15 mins because i was like uhhh i literally don’t remember what i ate for dinner. it’s okay though i scrolled through my calendar and recollected the events so now you get to see three days of my unfiltered interesting food consumption habits??? enjoy??? at least it was candid. i also wanted to do this speed blog challenge to help me take blogging less seriously and i think mission accomplished on that front so i’m pretty happy about that. also HANGING WITH THE BLOGGERS WAS SUPER CUTIES and everyone was so fun to hang out with so we must do this more… it will happen trust  

third place: ellie

I thought writing about the T was very thematic lol. As I said in my blog, I really love public transport and just being able to go places. Also on another note the bloggers are the coolest people in the world (and MIT) so I was really happy to get to spend time with y’all, doing cursed things on the T and saying cursed thing in the commons and eating really yummy babka. I also loved the freedom of just writing without thinking too much about all the word choice and phrasing – 
        its like drawing in MS paint,
      
 where you can’t be perfect, you just want to get the ideas and content down. the silly contest/time limit thing also helped me just word vomit on the page, in a way. overall I really loved it and I hope we can do smth similar soon >:) redline challenge when???

fourth place: allison

Writing quickly is… not my strong suit, so I needed a prompt that was relatively simple (clear plot line, nuclear, minimal introspection, etc.). Pumpkins fit the bill, and for once I am not several months too late for posting something [specific time period]-themed! Writing with other people was also super fun. Plus getting out and seeing Boston!!  Yay Blogston Commons :D

last but not least: sara

Just going in, I knew this challenge would be a struggle for me – I tend to get stuck on details. For context, it took me around ~10 hours to write my first blog post, not counting the nearly two weeks of ideation & six handwritten pages of outlining that came before. I spent hours playing around with sentence structure and the ordering of paragraphs and each individual word choice. It was a process that I loved, but also one that I realize often gets in my way while I’m actually writing. One of the best pieces of writing advice I’ve ever gotten – from an English professor I had in high school! – is to learn to detangle the creator and critic inside me, to learn to let the critic rest so that the creator can… create. That’s something I’m working on, and this fun, little challenge felt like the perfect way to practice getting out of my head while writing.

I tend to use writing as a medium of introspection, kind of like a fluid and confessional way to explore the big ideas I have floating within me and to consolidate them into something more cohesive. Taking my subject matter less seriously for a change helped me think about my life in new ways, though. My prompt was to write about my favorite eating utensil, but since our blogs had to relate to our given prompts only tangentially, I chose forks as my starting point and let my mind wander. Putting together the story I tell in this latest blog helped me notice some of the finer details of my life. I’m the girl who loves instant noodles, the girl who still has to look up whether something is microwave-safe every single time, the girl who calls her mom at 1am on the regular. In a way, these small details are more meaningful and more telling of who I am then all the big philosophies I can compose in my head. And I’m a rambler at my core, so it felt good to just let all that out while writing rather than trying to be economical with my words.

I’ve still got a long way to go with writing under a time limit – if Jebby can be declared the absolute winner of our little challenge, then, as the last person to finish, I guess that makes me the absolute loser. It took me over an hour to write my first eleven words, but then I wrote the remaining eight hundred under a twenty-minute timer, so I think I’m making progress. And I loved, loved, loved spending time with the other bloggers. I say this all the time to the people in my life, but I am truly in awe of the other bloggers, who are some of the most fun, interesting, and creative people I know. I love spending time with them and getting inspired and soaking up their genius via osmosis. Counting down the days till the 
        #RedLineChallenge 🤤

someday,Kai V. '25,0,2024-11-10T00:00:00-05:00,"This summer, my friends in LA kept telling me I hadn’t changed at all since high school. I expected to feel annoyed: in an objective sense, I’m a lot better adjusted now than I was in high school, and I might have wanted this to be recognized. Instead I just felt relieved that there was some core part of myself they could still easily reach out and touch, unaltered by three years of transcontinental distance.

It was my first time really hanging out with them in about three years: my family moved out of LA when the pandemic started, so I had barely been back since then. Actually it was wonderful to see how many things had stayed the same, little things I’d forgotten and felt a warm surge of familiarity upon recognizing. Los Angeles is filled with murals sprawling over twenty-story-tall brick buildings and stout concrete drugstore walls alike. Saints, women, flowers, eyes, music, all awash in rainbow. All of us sweating under one sun. Whenever I saw a mural I’d passed by a million times back then, I felt a jolt of sweet memory. There were new murals, too, blooms and shoots where the city had grown since my last visit. Coming back together, we both had something new to give.

My friends owned cars and had deeper voices. They all looked thicker, sturdier. I thought I did too: finally over the past year I’d achieved a consistent workout routine and diet that lent some volume to my upper body. “There’s something weirdly satisfying about Kai being athletic now,” S said. I thrilled at the idea of one of my old friends, who’d known me back when I failed each and every single one of the state fitness tests (underweight; zero push-ups; zero squats; zero sit-ups), calling me athletic. I was surprised, too, that S and I could now joke about our coursework with each other, when our high school interests had been so disparate. We’d both taken the long way around to computer science at our respective colleges.

We swam at the beach and went to J’s place afterwards. During the early pandemic I had lived with J’s family for a few months. Since then they had renovated their kitchen and bathroom and adopted a dog, and his sister was about two feet taller. But the house smelled just the same as it had when I stayed there. Actually I was struck by how immediate it was—crossing the threshold, I mean, of the door to his house, and how rapidly it transported me to that period four years ago when on weeknights I would make a lava cake and he would pull up Attack on Titan and we would watch and do our calculus homework and talk about life.

We played Terraforming Mars in the garage until J had to catch his flight. Then A drove me back to his house to spend the night. It was early morning—something like 4 a.m.—when we shuffled sleepily from his car to his apartment, enveloped in gentle southern Californian warmth. He had moved since high school to a new place that smelled different. (I knew the smell of his old place very well: we were often build partners for Science Olympiad, so I was in his garage all the time, arguing about designs and rationing our remaining solder, always in a delirium of sleep deprivation and cold in the nights before competition. After competitions we mostly played Black Ops 2 in his living room and blew up MOSFETs.)

In the morning when his mom saw me she began reminiscing on my and A’s high school days. “Do you remember when I would take you guys to UCLA for chemistry lectures?” I did—and remembered her buying us tamales on the way there every month for two years, always trying to convince me of the merits of eating meat after I went vegetarian but switching to buying me tamales filled with chili and cheese instead of pork anyway. “Do you still have your Spanish?” I didn’t; I had spoken maybe three full sentences in Spanish since graduation.

She put hot chocolate on the stove and began making a tall stack of toast with butter for me and the rest of her children. A’s little brother, who had barely been able to say a complete sentence the last time I saw him, was now explaining his Pokemon collection to me. Finally just before I left, his mom gave me a hug: “You’re mostly the same as you were in high school. You’re less shy, though, no?”

Maybe it speaks to the morbid weirdo I was as a child, but I’ve never related to the saying “you don’t know what you have until you lose it.” During recess I hovered at some removed vantage point, sometimes on the swings or else behind some bushes or under the low canopy of a tree, where I could see everyone else but no one would notice me, and narrated the scene in my head. Many times I thought, life will only get worse from here, so I should always appreciate the moment. I have no idea why I was this down on life when I was, like, ten years old. But in any case, I was always soaking in nostalgia for the present. Dreading the decay that would come with time passing.

Only recently have I felt that, although the moment is worth giving yourself over to, so is the passage of time. I live at pika now, an 
        ILG
      
 at MIT. A few weeks ago a small contingent went apple picking at an orchard and brought back bags and bags of the crispest, sweetest apples I had ever eaten. By chance three pika alumni were visiting that week; one of them works at a cider brewery. So the following Friday night I walked into the 
        CGE
      
 and found people squeezing the liquid from apple pulp into a funnel while alumni gathered, reminiscing over their days at pika: Wow, I remember this. But so much has changed.

When I come home, someone’s cooking dinner for the house, playing Charli xcx over the speakers; each painting hanging on the wall of the staircase up to my room is one I recognize every stroke of. Now after I’m away for a week, when I step over the threshold to the foyer once again, the smell of the house hits me all at once and I remember what to expect: my roommate’s jacket draped over his swivel chair, one housemate’s piano notes floating up the stairwell, another’s distinctive whistling through the window.

All around pika hang reminders of past lives: the murals washing over walls, a poem written in sharpie next to the bathroom mirror, another printed out and taped between the ceiling and the doorframe. I’ve never considered myself big on poetry, but this autumn is convincing me otherwise. It turns out I love poetry when I know it meant something to someone, when it’s not just an abstract stream of verse that I feel pressured to “get”, when instead it’s a diaphanous hand reaching through space and time to show me a slice of its world. I like the poetry plastered around pika because it shows the love people had for their housemates then, and how similar it is to the love I have now.

Love is closing my eyes just to forget if each breath of air is mine or yours. Love is a deal, you sit on the couch scraping a spoon around your bowl and I lie in bed falling asleep to the sound of someone else choosing to crumble to entropy in the same space as me. Sitting in the 
        murph
      
 together, you’re plucking at your bass, I’m palming a glass of juice I won’t finish. At the end of the night I’m thinking—when someone asks me, as a joke, what I’d do if I dropped out of school now—the answer is to be with my friends, to sit together leaning softly on each other’s tired bodies, to keep crystallizing a core I’ll hold on to forever, so that in four years I will reach out and find the same person you are now, a little older and wiser and sturdier but you just the same.

To ask where you are and feel happy when you say you’re enjoying your date. To be under your silk touch light eyes struck like a guitar string by your voice. To feel sorry when I say the wrong thing; to feel the opening of a waterfall when I make you laugh. To laugh and laugh and laugh and to know that makes nothing between us less valuable. To be there someday in your living room while your mom puts hot chocolate on the stove for me. For some time I had forgotten the simple, warm glow of friendship; now it wells over everything else.",,0
24 Pumpkins,Allison E. '27,5,2024-11-09T00:00:00-05:00,"As a person who hails from a land devoid of seasons, I consider it my utmost duty to take advantage of any fall-related activities that come my way. Amongst other things, I’ve been taking pictures of the changing leaves (for some reason, the trees on campus are sad and brown, while the trees along Charles River are gloriously red), jumping into random piles of leaves (shoutout to the folks who are making these), and trying a variety of fall-themed Trader Joe’s snacks (the maple syrup fudge is absolutely horrendous). 

But those are all the small, trifling acts of an amateur fall enthusiast. The true spirit of college fall can only be captured in something far sillier. Today, I present to you: Operation Pumpkin.

Objective: Transport 24 large, carving-size pumpkins 1.5 miles across the Harvard Bridge

Client: The International Student Association, for its Inter-College Halloween Board Game Party

Target: Star Market – 53 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02199

Operatives: Miranda Z. ‘27, Evelyn L. ‘27, Csilla F. ‘27, Allison E. ‘27

Equipment: 2 carts borrowed from dorms and an indominable spirit

Timeline: Complete by 2000

The mission was scheduled to begin at 1800, with a tight turnaround to meet the timeline. We quickly encountered delays, however, and by the time that two dorm carts were acquired, it was 1830. The clock was ticking. We sped across the bridge with our carts, moving carefully so as to avoid assaulting nearby pedestrians. 

the journey begins :O

We encountered our first obstacle upon reaching Boston. Notably, it was a Friday night, which meant that the streets were filled with people for whom we immediately became a public nuisance (sincere apologies, y’all 😔). Luckily, we made it through the crowded sections without doing bodily harm to any bystanders (or ourselves), and soon arrived at Star Market.

Our late start meant that we only had 45 minutes left, but fortuitously, it also allowed us to rendezvous with an additional operative. Now armed with 33% more labor, we descended upon Star Market. We had called ahead to ensure that there were enough pumpkins to satisfy our objective, and we were not disappointed by their stock. It took a surprisingly long time to actually pick out and load 24 pumpkins into the carts, and an additional grocery-shopping side quest waylaid us further. Nevertheless, we persevered.

feat. our miscellaneous grocery shopping

And then began the true challenge–transporting more than 300 lbs of pumpkin 1.5 miles back across the bridge to our dorm. With two people to each cart, weaving in and out of people and construction zones, we began our journey back. We pushed through the weird stares, took heart from the confused smiles, and “sorry”’d our way through the streets of Boston. On several occasions, our carts almost rolled straight into the street–for some reason, the sidewalks are all slanted into the road, so we had to have one person pushing from behind, and one person standing on the side to keep it from sliding into oncoming traffic.

these carts were HEAVY man :(

Fortunately, we reached the Harvard Bridge with our pumpkins (and nearby pedestrians) unscathed, and from there it was a straight shot back. We were running behind schedule, but nonetheless–24 pumpkins were successfully transported home. Mission accomplished!

Ellie on the M.T.A.,Ellie F. '28,5,2024-11-09T00:00:00-05:00,"I grew up without any public transportation. The closest thing we had in Arkansas was an old-fashioned tram system in Little Rock, and a single bus route that I don’t believe really existed. But when my family traveled to Chengdu, China, and eventually more and more cities, I got to see how convenient a subway system could be. Also, I hate driving, so public transportation has that going for it too.

The first time I visited Boston, in my junior year of high school, I fell in love with the T. It’s not the best subway system in the world, of course, but I remember riding the Red Line and passing Charles/MGH, watching the MIT sailboats glide on the shimmering water. I remember ringing the chimes at Kendall/MIT and wondering about the minimum number of T stops you’d need to pass in order to go to every stop on the T without leaving.

The T is central to the college experience I’ve had and want to have. I transferred to the Orange Line to eat at Chinatown with my SSP friends. I went up to Harvard Station when my cousins visited, and Central when my friends and I got tickets to an EDM rave (it was really loud). On the last day of Orientation, all of the first-year class went to the aquarium. On our way back, past midnight, we skipped down the streets to the station, admiring the way light reflected off the faces of all the buildings in the dim light. When I felt down, I rode the Red Line across the river and walked up the narrow streets to buy a succulent from a tiny flowershop bursting with greenery.

As for buses: I’ve had some, well, interesting experiences. I once asked my Bostonian friend how the buses worked here. He said that they didn’t. I managed anyways, somehow. I’ve talked to a woman crocheting while waiting for the Harvard bus, and I’ve ignored a man telling the entire bus about his pencil drawing of Jesus. At CPW, I missed my stop and ended up in Harvard (the horror!) at 1 a.m. My roommate and I rode the bus to Symphony Hall, and we discretely listened to a college-aged guy use linear algebra terms to describe his life while my roommate repeatedly forgot to hold on to the dangling handles. We were a bit surprised when the guy didn’t get off at MIT.

I love living in a city, and I love being able to access so many amazing places. Now, I have another lovely experience to add to my bank of stories: writing together with these awesome bloggers. I started this blog squatting down, laptop on my knees, half-tilting into Jebby in a shakey Red Line compartment as Sara struggled to start a hotspot and Janet and Allison laughed and took pictures. At Park Street, I hurriedly gathered all my stuff, dropping my phone and water bottle in the process, and now, I’m sitting on a strangely long bench in Boston Commons, discussing squirrel sizes, and typing away on my computer. Here’s to four more years of adventures on the T! After all, it’s not about the destination—it’s about the journey (on the T) along the way.",,0

not to be cliche, but there is truly no better time to have friends than in college. the experience of living 
         no more than a 5 minute walk away from friends 
      
 makes every day feel like a constant sleepover and you really get to yap and have fun 

… and not to be meta and all but i just read jebby’s blog draft that she whipped up in 20 minutes and got inspired so now i’ve decided to take this less seriously and i was going to do a lowkey deep post about conversations with friends and meals as a method for socialisation but that’s too much brainpower and pre-amble, 
        SO NOW YOU GUYS GET TO HEAR WHAT I’VE BEEN HAVING FOR DINNER RECENTLY AND WHAT I DO OVER DINNER!! 
      
 food reel style. maybe i’m exposing my content consumption a little. oops

yesterday we had a little 
        rpm
      
 dinner. the timing of it was lowkey early for me (4:30, considering that this was basically dinner), but because i had just finished a problem set i decided to be jobless and reward myself by just sitting there and eating the really good food that mit administration paid for. we had salmon and chicken and quinoa salad catered from some newbury shop and i have to say it might have been the best food that i’ve had in a while. we were just talking about our experiences looking after baby frosh and it was honestly really cute! a lot of the rpms talked about giving back because their rpms were super helpful to them, and after hearing about their newbury trips i’ve decided to finally commit to making boba with my frosh. frosh if you’re reading this it’s going to happen and it’s not just my stream of consciousness thoughts 

two days ago i was dying over my 
        6.1210
      
 midterm so i was honestly a bit too stressed to eat that much food. i reheated some leftovers i had from the 
        maseeh
      
 
        greenbox
      
 
        two days back
      
 and poached an egg with it, and i ate it while stress scrolling some food reels about meal prepping that i have and probably will never get around to using 

three days ago i had a dinner with a friend, Tristan C. ’27, at baker dining which was actually the first time i ate at baker dining again since freshman fall, and i have to admit their bokchoy and sesame chicken that day wasn’t too bad. we were talking about how our education systems were structured because we’re both internationals and how we had to translate all of 
        our weird grading systems over to american norms. 
      
 i also saw like 3 distinct groups of friends at baker dining and none of us ever go there so i guess everyone was just feeling like soba noodles and bokchoy that day 

anyways this is the extent of my memory so i’m going to quit YAPPING about random dinners that i had and maybe one day you’ll get some more substantive takes from me on dinners and random conversations. thanks for coming to my youtube short remember to like and subscribe 😍

FUBN USELESS FACT:

 

 



Did you know that there was a great molasses flood in boston?? Absolutely nuts! It was somewhere in North End where 
        in the 1900s or something
      
 a giant tank of molasses exploded and flooded the streets of boston, and it straight up 
        killed some people.
      
 it was insane. I read a 
        Harvard article
      
 where some smart person figured out how fast the molasses were flowing, and apparently it was faster than 
        Usain Bolt.
      
 Scary!!!! And then the streets smelled like molasses for a littl ebit which was pleasant i guess. But you know whatisn’t pleasant? The molasses would be hot and runny qwhen it escaped the tank, butt hen when it flowed over the people onthe street on a cold January day in New England, it would move significantly slower and people got stuck and sucked into the molasses and it was liek sweet quicsand! mmmmm! but not mmm they died. DID I mention that they died? 



Also fun fact about boston, there is the Freedom Trail, which I’ve wanted to wlak since frehsman year, but I would keep getting hosed :( but a few weeks agp, I wasn’t hosed and so I could walk the whole thing! I walked all the way from Park street to 
        The battle of Bunker Hill.
      
 I saw a bunch of historical places like the Samuel Adams statue and aslso 
        the samuel adams brewery/bar
      
 where theere were a bunch of miillennials having fun! I saw a bunch of cemeteries, which was realistically 
        two or three.
      
 I didn’t go to the granary burying ground because i’ve alreayd been there before. Anyway I saw this one grave that was next to a stump with these pretty mushrooms. I forgo 
        tth eman
      
 of the person who was buried there but it was dope. Then I got a bacon cheddar bagel sandwich somewhere. It was delicious, but there were too many poppy seeds on the bagel bun.



Anyway, I reached the USS Constitution, and I’ve already been to the museum exhibit but I did go into the gift shop to see if I wanted to buy anything. I didn’t buy anything. But I overheard a couple, where the guy was trying to persuade his girlfriend to let him buy ship-related souvenirs because his friend really liked ships. I think he was lying. Then, I reached the Bunker Hill Monument! On a whim, I stood in line for anyone who wanted to climb the monument. I hate stairs, but then I decided to do it because there was an eight-year-old or maybe a five-year-old boy who was waiting in front of me, so my adult ego got the best of me. I forgot how many steps it was—
        269 steps?
      
 Over 
        250 steps.
      
 It was a struggle. I’m not that fit, so I had to take a rest every 50 steps. I was brathing so hard around the 200th step that i thought I was going to throw up. But I didn’t, and I reached the top! I took a picture of an overhead view of Charlestown and the North End. The trees were just turning red and orange, and it was gorgeous. Those were a lot of fun facts about Boston!

all the notes i took in a week,Veronica P. '27,3,2024-11-08T00:00:00-05:00,"Not too long ago, my desk was covered in every variety of stationary imaginable- brush pens, washi tape, wax stamps, glitter pens, you get the gist… 

Today, my collection of school supplies consists of my ipad, my apple pencil, and a few loose pens and pencils that only see the light of day when midterms roll around. 

While I’ve fallen far from my fifteen-highlighters-bullet-journaling-timelapse-note-taking days (or maybe the better word is recovered?), my appreciation for the act of note taking remains. So, without further ado, here are all the notes I take in a typical week of classes. 

2.086- Numerical Computation for Mechanical Engineers

This class has 1 hour lectures every Monday and Wednesday, and meets for a two hour lab every week. While the lab itself focuses primarily on the computation aspect of the course- teaching us how to solve problems using Matlab- the lectures provide the theoretical basis. This week, we were reviewing linear algebra (for maybe the fifth time since I’ve gotten to MIT). 

 

2.003- Dynamics and Control I 

This class has 9 am lectures every Tuesday and Thursday, as well as one hour of recitation. For the week I’ve decided to share, we were using angular momentum principles to analyze particles and 3D bodies undergoing planar motion and learning about equivalent loads. The professor for this course loves to break up traditional lecture time with several “puzzlers,” or mini problems relevant to the material.

2.001- Mechanics and Materials I 

Full disclosure, I do not have handwritten lecture notes for this course. The instructor publishes their notes before every lecture (1.5 hrs MW), so I opt to listen in and annotate those rather than create my own from scratch. 

This was, however, a week that happened to be leading up to our first exam, which we’re allowed to bring in a page of handwritten notes for. We’re expected to understand and manipulate a lot of equations, so I tried to color code the variables to enhance my exam-taking experience (success rate unclear). 

 

 

And that’s all! In MechE, note-taking time is somewhat negligible compared to problem solving time, at least in my experience thus far. I hope these notes were intelligible enough for you to glean something from them (even if that something is just that i love to use arrows and write really small…) 

P.S.: I’m also taking a class on the history of science (STS.003), although for this one I typically just annotate the readings and lecture slides.

P.P.S: these notes are from nearly a month ago, which is approximately how long ago i told myself i was going to upload this blog","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/notes-blog-10.jpg

Reason for discontinuation: I couldn’t come up with enough ideas.

Not a drawing, but wanted to include this

The Harvard x MIT fanfic that I gave an in-class presentation on

Date: February 29, 2024

Premise: I took a class where the first project was to take a story that we’ve already written and tell it in a different medium. I didn’t have any written stories that I was comfortable enough to share, except for this fan-comic that I made with some friends when we were incoming freshmen. It was a wholesome, non-sexual story about how the anthropomorphized characters of MIT and Harvard fall in love. I animated some of the important scenes with GIFs and then put them in a slideshow. The professor gave me an A.

Reason for discontinuation: My common sense kicked in before I made a post about it.

I think I am slowly going insane,Andi Q. '25,4,2024-11-06T00:00:00-05:00,"Last week, Professor Han made an exciting announcement during 6.5940 (TinyML) lecture: the class was holding a competition, with AI development boards (worth $500+) as the top prizes! The competition involved watching hundreds of AI-generated videos and rating how realistic each looked. His lab was trying to create a benchmark for evaluating AI-generated videos, and outsourcing to MIT students was the best way to get the high-quality human-labeled data that OpenAI can only dream of.

The first-place prize was an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which Professor Han had demo-ed at the start of the semester running a ChatGPT-like application on a 
        retro CRT-looking
      
 display. It was so cute, and I really wanted to build one for myself, so I knew I had to compete.

It’s so cute! I want one :)

The dataset consisted of a few thousand videos generated by a handful of AI video models from prompts like “The archer launches the arrow towards the target” and “The robotic arm slides a towel across the table”.

“Wow, these videos… all look terrible” was my immediate reaction after watching and labeling a few of them. The AI models were bad – hilariously bad in many cases. I vividly remember watching one video generated from the prompt “Soccer players in purple celebrate as the crowd cheers” which just showed purple people-looking blobs jiggling on a blurry green background and one of them morphing into the soccer ball. It was nothing like the sleek videos OpenAI likes to tout in its demos.

(This is the kind of slop that these AI models would typically generate. To be fair, all the videos were generated for free, so I didn’t expect them to be that good in the first place.)

Yet one random Chinese AI model – “minimax” – was exceptionally good. Not only were its videos smooth and crisp, but they usually also followed the laws of physics. When I first saw a minimax video, I thought it was a real video mixed in as a sanity check for labelers.

(This video is taken from minimax’s website. I didn’t feel like sifting through the actual dataset for a minimax video, but most of them looked good like this.)

Two days and a few hundred videos in, I began picking up on some interesting trends. Each model would fail in predictable ways: OpenSora would always generate people as Lego mini-figures, CogVideoX would follow prompts very well but produce grainy/jittery videos, and minimax (my beloved) would simply not fail. (Each model (even the really awful ones) was also really good at generating videos of photorealistic feet 
        for some reason
      
, which I found funny.)

Eventually, my brain just went on autopilot, labeling video after video for an hour. It was a good break from my usual MIT schoolwork, and it was somewhat entertaining seeing all the ways the AI models could hallucinate cars and people morphing into other things.

But that’s when everything started to go downhill.

It turns out (unsurprisingly) that minimax is not perfect. However, it only ever fails in extremely subtle ways, like a strand of hair experiencing a tad too much gravity or a tree branch swaying a tad too little in a gust of wind. Without me realizing it, these subtle flaws began to mess with my mind.

When I took a break from labeling videos to eat dinner in the dining hall, I caught myself staring at some ice cubes swirling around a friend’s drink.

“Hang on,” I thought, “is that how liquids should behave in real life? Those ice cubes seem to be moving around a little too fast.”

In fact, liquids do behave that way because I was experiencing real life and not some AI-generated pseudo-reality. Still, it was unnervingly disorienting to look at those ice cubes.

I still really wanted that NVIDIA board though, so I just shrugged it off as me being tired (it was a Thursday evening, after all), went to sleep, and continued labeling videos the next day. With each new video I labeled though, real life became ever so slightly less realistic. Human hair seemed to disobey the laws of gravity (somehow the videos had primed me to expect hair to act like it does in Pixar movies). Car tires seemed to rotate too quickly for the speed they were traveling at (that was another thing none of the AI models could get quite right). Sometimes I’d just stand on the sidewalk and watch the trees swaying gently in the wind, wondering if my eyes were just playing tricks on me or if the leaves were truly morphing into those strange, unnatural shapes.

I finally decided to stop on Sunday after I had labeled over 1500 videos. Unfortunately, this wasn’t quite enough to win the NVIDIA board – another student had labeled 700 more videos than me. Instead, I won a Qualcomm Snapdragon Development Kit – 
        less cool than the NVIDIA board
      
 but, as Professor Han assured me, still plenty powerful for running a large language model. All for the low, low price of my sanity.

Honestly, this was worth the effort I spent labeling all those videos.

Shortly after receiving the kit, I got an email from 
        Scale AI
      
 about participating in a “fun coding challenge” that was clearly just another data labeling task for benchmarking a large language model they had developed. I think I’ve learned my lesson about labeling AI-generated content though, so no thanks, Scale. (Maybe next time though, if you’re offering me a free GPU as a prize.)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-8.54.13%E2%80%AFAM-400x255.png

The [REDACTED] Family Dinner 🥟,Fiona L. '27,4,2024-11-04T00:00:00-05:00,"One email. Over forty recipients.



Scraped from 
        search.mit.edu
      
, I assembled a mailing list of faculty, grad students, undergraduates, and more. My aim was simple: to organize a dinner consisting solely of MIT undergraduates with my last name.

Through ~careful analysis~ of the cuisine in the area, the perfect candidate for the dinner was found: Mu Lan Taiwanese restaurant.

I give them an estimate of a party of 15, based on the number of people who indicated their availability. I then remember that I forget to poll the names of people who were available. (Oops) Cue a second Google Form, an “RSVP form.” I call Mu Lan telling them that the number would be more around… 7 people.

The date rolls around and everything goes swimmingly. The food is delicious. We talk about a variety of things: our different stations at MIT, summer plans, how much Chinese we each know. At the end, somebody brings up that we should continue the tradition of [REDACTED] family dinners.

the first family dinner!

That dinner occurred in March of 2024. The second [REDACTED] Family Dinner occurred just last week–at Su-Miao Hunanese Restaurant. 
 The food was amazing, and I’m definitely planning to go again. 
 To my delight, 12 people showed up.
 I think that my planning skills have also developed a little since last time, although forgetting to ask for names in a Google Form isn’t a high bar to overcome.

My 
        table
      
 shared stories about where we came from (China, Georgia, New York, California, etc.), (or, alternatively, Columbia University, Harvard cross-registration, Media Lab Phd, MIT M.Eng, New Vassar, etc.), where we wanted to be (physics professorship, Harvard business school, M.Eng, etc.), and what we feared becoming (unemployed, due to the current job market).

It was really nice to meet so many people with different personalities and different goals and at different stages of their lives–people who only had their common last name tying them together. I learned about things I never would’ve originally: MIT’s AI Ventures class, the research assistance funding for M.Eng students, and the ratio of Harvard students cross registered at MIT versus MIT students cross registered at Harvard. 
 At the very end, when I fronted the check, I got clowned on for using a TI-84 to calculate each person’s portion. Which, I’ll admit, was kind of deserved.

the second family dinner!

The next [REDACTED] Family Dinner is, aspirationally, happening sometime next semester. I’m excited to see all the faces, new and old, who will show up, there to entertain my Silly Idea for the next few hours.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-11-04-at-11.20.46-PM.png

The Craziest 3 Days of Soccer Ever,Emiko P. '25,2,2024-11-04T00:00:00-05:00,"Hey, everyone! It’s time for everyone’s favorite update… soccer season!!

We just wrapped up our regular season, and I wanted to share the last three days that led up to that, because a lot went down.

Wednesday

On Wednesday, we had our second to last game of the regular season against Wellesley. We had set a goal this year to not only win the regular season conference title, but to beat every single team in our conference that faced us. And after we beat Wellesley 4-1 that night, we were one step closer to that goal. 

But that was not the most eventful thing of the night.

Our teammate Meagan R. ‘24 shattered a 20-year-old record by scoring her 53rd career goal that night against Wellesley – making her the MIT Women’s Soccer all-time leading scorer!! I think this quote by my dad sums up Meagan pretty well: “Dang, that Meagan is a problem.” 

Indeed, she is. I have never seen any other player be so viciously shifty and unstoppable. Watching her sprint down the left side of the field, her defender huffing behind her (literally eating Meagan’s dust), and rip a shot into the upper corner of the net will never get old. She is our beloved leader, and we are so happy she decided to grace us with her silly and energetic presence for one more semester :)

Thursday

Thursday was Halloween, which means it was time for one of the most iconic MIT Women’s Soccer traditions: Halloween practice. Every year, the seniors pick a theme and assign everyone a costume that they must wear out to practice. This year’s theme was sports, and the team did not disappoint. It sure was a spooky sight as equestrians and horses, synchronized swimmers, sumo wrestlers, canoers, 5’3’’ football players, and gladiators paraded around the fields that night.

Another monumental event that happened that night was that we had our last lift in our temporary Varsity Weight Room. There is a special weight room reserved for athletes, and for the past few months it’s been getting renovated. The grand opening just happened, so this was our last time lifting in the temporary weight room. At least we did it in style!

Saturday

After 18 games played in two months, Saturday was our very last game of the regular season. And not only that – it was SENIOR DAY!!! As someone who has been on the soccer team since freshman year, Senior Day has always been bittersweet. It meant saying goodbye to the people I had looked up to and having to think for the first time about what the team would be like without them. I had never really considered how it would be from the other perspective, to look at the team and try to memorize every last detail – the memes in my locker from my psych buddy, the team huddled around our Hood Beav mascot, the casual jokes, the sharing (sometimes stealing) of candy from people’s lockers. Senior Day is when you take a second to appreciate the people, the sisters, the teammates. I am so grateful to have a team that brightens up my day, that supports me and loves me, and that just really wants the best for me.

Senior Day was amazing! We played Emerson, and we won 3-0! I might have scored the game winning goal ;) That was definitely a good Senior Day gift. After the game, we exchanged presents, the juniors gave some speeches, and we gorged ourselves on cake and Chipotle with our families and friends and teammates.

Also, in classic MIT Women’s Soccer fashion (in line with what seems to be the theme this week), we broke another record. With our final win against Emerson, we are the first team to ever go 11-0 in our conference in the regular season. History = made.

And with that, our regular season comes to a close, and we end it with 17 wins, 1 loss, and 1 tie. We also end it ranked #3 in the nation (which is also a program record!). Our season is far from over, though. We have the NEWMAC tournament next, where all the teams in our conference reconvene and fight over the tournament trophy. After that, we hopefully make our run in the NCAA tournament, where all D3 schools in the nation set their eyes on the prize of becoming a National Champion. This year, we definitely have our eyes on that prize.

The past few days of crazy team traditions and the culmination of an entire season of hard work is the reason why I love soccer and our team so much. I can’t wait to see what the post-season has in store for us.

people appreciation post,Fatima A. '25,4,2024-11-02T00:00:00-04:00,"in the past months, I have felt the impact of various people around me on the quality of my life with full force. MIT is so vast and there are so many different people who make sure it continues the way it does. I wanted to appreciate the people who make my MIT experience what it is.

friends 

this goes without saying so I will keep this short but my friends are genuinely the sole reason for my sanity in a time where one simply cannot afford such luxury. this semester, I have gotten to enjoy being a “Greek chorus” in relativity with Feli, aggressive nodding with Zimi in quantum, spending inordinate times working on relativity and the early universe with Jorian whose level-headedness is genuinely unmatched, playing copious amounts of redactle with Nora, making sure I am not losing funny points in front of Jonathan, the constant struggle of man to be like Matthew, the correct mix of wise and bully that is Prajna, the kind of unhinged humor that is unique only to Jenny and being bullied over text by Alan. and everyone else who I have failed to mention here, I appreciate you all so, so much.

instructors & mentors 

I have been incredibly lucky with all my professors throughout MIT. this year is no exception. I have professors who I would take a bullet for, they are so good at teaching, are very kind and I have been enjoying all my classes so much. I am taking relativity with Prof. H and Prof. E, both of whom are just so great. recently, I got to watch an old School of Science video about gravitational waves that Prof. H appears in at the very end, which was really exciting. my professor for the early universe is a legend and I will leave it at that. quantum is certainly one of the classes of all times in terms of the length of assignments and the first midterm was a time but it is clear that the professor cares about the class and the lectures are very well organized and understandable so I am enjoying the class despite the bit of pain. outside of technicals, I am doing a translations project for credit and my professor is so, so kind. for some of the Punjabi dialogues that I just couldn’t figure out (I am not really fluent in Punjabi and it doesn’t help that the dialogues are supposed to be gibberish), he actually asked his mom for help and gave me pointers, which I am eternally grateful for.

Keita, my graduate student mentor for my math UROP and Wati, my physics UROP mentor have been incredibly patient with me as I learn some of the foundational stuff and I could not ask for better mentors.

dorm custodial staff

simply, we would all cease to exist along with the buildings we live in. all these talks of the incredibly unique culture of MIT dorms and how they foster a community rely on people who make sure that the dorms are clean and livable and a home to so many of us. shoutout to Dennis, who in addition to all of this, also makes sure you never feel down when leaving the house in the morning. everyone on the floor will agree that he is unbelievably kind and patient and treats every single person with levels of enthusiasm every single day that I can only hope to even feign.

dining staff 

I had a very complicated relationship with dining, well, it was not very complicated, I hated it. I am a very picky eater and having dietary restrictions plus having your food being completely switched isn’t the most fun combination. it took me very long to start being okay with dining hall food. only after this spring, when I was cooking for myself did I really became appreciative of the people who had been cooking for me. I have also had enough time to adjust that I do not mind dining hall food at all anymore so although I knew this before, I have really come to appreciate all the dining hall staff. I think it takes a great deal of patience to exhibit the level of consistent politeness that the grill chef holds. Randy and Marlene always make sure to ask about your days, the omelette chef now knows my order, there is a chef at Maseeh dining who always calls you “love,” people who I have inquired about dietary restrictions will let me know about unlabeled food when they see me and there are so many other staff people who continuously exhibit incredible levels of kindness and care.

(I am too awkward to ask for names so I don’t know all the names. there has been some dining staff appreciation with spotlights on different people each week but I don’t think they actually continued that past the first week or something. maybe, I have just not been paying too much attention.)

all the offices around MIT 

I have my gripes with some offices around MIT, but the people I have interacted with have more often than not just genuinely wanted to be helpful. whether that be having answers to your questions or redirecting you to other resources and people, I am so deeply indebted to people in the math department and all the random offices I have reached out to over the years. unironically, one of the most important lessons out of my time at MIT is to just, email. there are resources and people for your help and you just need to reach out and inquire about them. Currently, I am especially indebted to Kim from the distinguished fellowships office of MIT 
        CAPD
      
 for knowing what I want to say before I say it, for unbelievable and true empathy and for caring passionately about students.",,0
halloween down the infinite,Janet G. '27,1,2024-11-01T00:00:00-04:00,"Happy 
         (slightly belated) 
      
 Halloween! I woke up today and ran into so many amazing costumes that I couldn’t NOT post some of them here.

My day started off by running to lecture because I was late (what else is new), but then I got distracted by Benson L. ‘27 with this awesome LED helmet that I’m pretty sure he built himself:

this was SO cool to see in real life. you could see all the wiring on the inside too

And even when I got to my 
        6.1210
      
 lecture, it seemed like some people were a little dressed up.

ah yes, a normal day in lecture with a normal set of… people sitting in the front row

Okay, so people were definitely dressed up.

After lecture, I had 30 minutes before my 
        weight training class 
      
so I spent it wandering down the 
         Infinite 
      
 to collect candy at all the different offices.

I think the people were definitely more interesting than the stalls themselves though.

The Trick O’ Treaters also went pretty all out with their costumes:

But I think my favourites were the group costumes.

At this point I had to run to my class, and ran into some final costumes along the way.

Not featured but some honourable mentions:

- A Luigi Dad and a Mario Daughter holding a mystery box to collect candy – so cute but they are not posted for privacy reasons

- someone who dressed up as a microwave chip (??) because I only heard about them and wasn’t able to find them by the end of the day

- someone dressed up as a corona beer who was too far away for me to catch up to

- like everyone else wearing a cool costume that i saw but didn’t manage to ask them for a photo (with permission)

Have a wonderful spooky season everyone :) 
        (and also a huge congrats to those of you who have submitted your early action application!) 
      
 While I’m hoping this is proof enough that MIT students have enough time in their lives to even occasionally dress up, I’m going to fight some other spooky demons called my second round of midterms now 💀","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image1-400x300.png

The Photos of Freshman Spring 📸,Fiona L. '27,5,2024-10-31T00:00:00-04:00,"The summer before college was my last summer of being 18, and thus my last year of eligibility for a ~special program~ my local library ran. They had little booklets at the front of the library for children to log the amount they read over the summer, where each booklet completed would be entered in a lottery for a $1000 dollar scholarship.

For kids up to age 13, the booklets only tracked the hours you read. For teens 13-18, the “booklets” changed into strips (perhaps meant to be bookmarks?) where you read and reviewed five books. I figured to optimize my books read/time spent ratio as an 18 year old, I would read short novellas and comics.

Spoiler alert: I didn’t win. Probably why the title of this blog is “The Photos of Freshman Spring” and not “HEY CHECK OUT THE $1000 I JUST WON!!!” But while reading one of these comics, Tsubasa Yamaguchi’s Blue Period, I stumbled upon an idea for a Cool Project™.

Blue Period is a manga about a high schooler, Yatora Yaguchi, who suddenly discovers a strong interest in art in his last year of high school and resolves to get into art school. In the first volume, his art teacher, Masako Saeki, assigns him “summer homework” meant to help him improve massively.

The summer homework

Daily photo!

Somewhere, deep inside me, I also had the desire to improve massively in art. But I’d never seriously nurtured this desire before. I also knew I’d be way too hosed to have time for all of that.

So maybe, I thought, I’d just use this as an excuse to do a cool thing. Like Saeki said, it would be an exercise in visual art and composition. But for me, it would also be an exercise in ✨consistency✨, a mythical attribute I’d been striving and struggling to obtain for all of high school. I wondered if a daily photo would be the thing that would keep me grounded through a semester I knew was going to be crazy. (Because, to be honest, what MIT semester isn’t absolutely crazy?)

And so, I got started, one photo at a time. Here are a some of my favorites:

February

March

April

May

I guess these photos didn’t make much of an impact in keeping me grounded. It was a pretty crazy semester, since I was still learning what my limits were outside of PNR. But at least I was somewhat consistent? Even if I couldn’t take a picture everyday, I at least kept it up for four months. And now I have all these photos to document my freshman year :D","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-30-at-4.09.45-PM-400x260.png

Learning about the ABCs,Janet G. '27,4,2024-10-29T00:00:00-04:00,"The Apple Bake Competition is an annual event held by the 
        Burton-Conner
      
 
        GRAs 
      
in the Fall of each year. It’s a competition where people bake a lot of goods with apples, to celebrate the bountiful fall harvest of apples and give us all a reason to use the massive hordes of apples we gain from the yearly apple-picking outings that MIT dorms help subsidise. For most people, it’s a great reason to wander down to the Porter Room on Sunday morning and grab some of the delicious dishes that people have cooked up.

For Conner 2, my floor, Apple Bake is a little more serious. It’s on our shirts, it’s in our blood, it’s the colour of our floor (apple-red). In the words of one of our floor chairs, Haylea B. ‘27, “Apple Bake is one of two mandatory C2 events per year”, so we might be a little obsessed with Apple Bake. It’s often because we have really good bakers and cooks on our floor, but it’s also because we are just really competitive people who want to defend our floor’s consecutive 25+ year history of winning Apple Bake. This year, we also decided to bring back our 
        Varsity Apple Bake jerseys,
      
 so we DEFINITELY couldn’t lose. 

I am the Resident Peer 
        Mentor
      
 for my floor this year. I also happen to be a little obsessed with tradition of Apple Bake. Therefore, this year, my lovely frosh and I decided to get the tradition going early. For our first Floor Frosh Social event, they pulled together to bake a lovely little apple pie; it was an incredible test of teamwork, and in true C2 tradition, also 
        test of the fire alarms. 
      
 We thankfully saved the suite before they set off the whole building though, so I guess we’re innovating and improving from this tradition. 

so fanning the wifi modem does not help with soothing the angry smoke detectors. also disclaimer no children were harmed in the process of making our floor nicknames

Every year, our floor has a sweet little spreadsheet going for Apple Bake — because even if we’re 
        the smallest floor in all of Burton-Conner,
      
 this does not stop us from submitting the largest number of entries. While quantity does not always mean quality (for instance, last year I hauled myself up at the bright and early time of 10am to peel some apples and 
        print out some sus photos for some “experimental apple art”),
      
 we have sufficiently incredible bakers and chefs to make some pretty darn incredible dishes. 

Most of our work started Saturday evening. The entire floor smelled amazing by the time I came back around 9pm; as I quote Lidia P. ‘27, “the floor smells like ASMR for my nose”. 

Now, I will be the first to say that I am not a baker. Unfortunately, this means that I am mostly useless in the context of Apple Bake, so I decided to try my hand at a few sculptures this year. I dragged Albert T. ‘26 with me to help me ideate and peel apples, and we spent about an hour trying to peel some apples in order to craft a “Big Ben” to pay homage to a sculpture from a few years ago. The attempt ended once I accepted that I could not plausibly find a way to stick long strips of apple peel onto a can of Peach Monster (don’t ask). At this point, we were too many apples in, so instead Albert had a moment of divine inspiration and we decided to go find some apple sculptures on Pinterest; these were MUCH more doable and below we have the end results! 

In the meanwhile, other people were cooking much more edible dishes. 

When Sunday morning came around, our suites were still busy cooking. You could hear HOTTOGO blasting through the floor as the lovely wakeup alarm for everyone, and we pushed through to get all our dishes in downstairs. 

BC began swarming the delectable goods. 

My apple carvings didn’t win, which was a little unfortunate, but I can’t really complain when I was competing against these masterpieces:

The performances were also pretty great:

even though it was a little goofy, we still won the performance category with our Hot To Go dance. We also picked up wins in some other categories, and at this point it should come as no spoiler to say that WE WON APPLE BAKE AGAIN!

i will meet zendaya even if it’s the death of me,Aiden H. '28,2,2024-10-26T00:00:00-04:00,"I’ve always been a little bit of a hypochondriac, and while that is probably connected to a lot of deeper things than this blog can go into, there is one clear trend: I hate being sick.

I hate the idea of not being as productive as possible, I hate the idea of not being able to do something, and I hate having to just suffer without immediate solutions.

My first couple months at MIT have tested this patience immensely.  My second weekend here, a whole four days before classes started, I got COVID for the first time. And yet again, when I woke up this Wednesday morning with the taste of death lodged in the back of my hot, sticky throat, I was devastated. It was the common cold, which is, dare I say, the most passive aggressive illness because it’s not bad enough that you have reason to complain but it is enough to make you dysfunctional.

And as I much as I hate being sick, this illness was notably bad for two reasons:

#1: Zendaya

I am a lifelong, ride-or-die Zendaya fan. Not that bad that I know her exact location or have a poster of her on my wall, but just underneath that.

I try not to gatekeep things I like from others, but some of y’all act like you’re serious Zendaya fans when I have been there since day one. I’m talking Shake It Up days. I’m talking KC Undercover. I’m talking I watched Disney Channel longer than I should have for Zendaya. Of course I’ve kept up with the more recent stuff, too (Spider-man, Dune, Challengers, Euphoria).

At any point in my life if you asked who my celebrity crush was, the answer was Zendaya. If I could meet anyone dead or alive? Zendaya. Have dinner with any celebrity? Zendaya. Favorite song?
        Replay by Zendaya.
      
What’s my favorite movie? Zendaya.

Well, Zendaya is in Boston on and off until December filming the new
        Ari Aster
      
movie with Robert Pattinson. So when I received
        very vital intel
      
Wednesday morning that Zendaya was in Cambridge, I (emotionally) imploded. This was coupled with my later Google stalking that found Zendaya was directly across the river on
        Newbury Street
      
the night before just walking around and shopping.

This is the most statistically likely time I will ever meet Zendaya. If we tragically rule out

A) me becoming a superstar and meeting her through Hollywood connections

B) me moving to London and “accidentally” becoming neighbors with her and Tom Holland

C) Spider-Man 4 both filming scenes with Zendaya and Ned at MIT and allowing students on the parts of campus where they’re filming

then now is my time to strike.

But naturally, as both a good person and someone who isn’t camera ready when they are sick, I could never risk going out to hunt down stumble upon Zendaya when I can barely speak, look like a blobfish, and can infect her.

This sickness feels like a test. In a lot of ways, the universe puts me in a weird situation (casually living blocks from Zendaya for two months) and then takes me away from it. This is just what being sick has always felt like. As soon as I start to enjoy something or get my life figured out, everything just crashes down for a couple days, leaving me to overthink in bed. It happened as soon as I moved here, and it is happening again.

#2: The being sick part

Okay not super original but I just hate being sick. Most of the time I just lie and act like I’m not sick and just go about my normal things because I would rather suffer than
        lay in bed and do nothing.
      


Being sick in a dorm is (drumroll, please)…even worse! Now I’m afraid of both getting my two roommates sick and being annoying with my incessant melodrama about my woes. Most of the time not having my own room here hasn’t been that torturous, but it’s the moments like these that it’s very apparent that rotting in bed alone is a privilege, not a right.

So to distract myself from existential thoughts and complaining, here’s a list of everything I frantically jumped around between doing:

- Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story

I devoured this show in a disgusting amount of time, but it’s not without reason. First, it’s almost Halloween so duh I’m gonna watch the most twisted stuff. Second, it’s a Ryan Murphy show, and ever since watching Glee and American Horror Story in 6th grade, I will forever try every show he makes. Third, I actually have very (mild) lore about the Menendez brothers. Because I was a little freak in my formative years, I had my true crime kick a lot earlier than everyone else. I was in 7th grade just obsessing over true crime documentaries, which is when my mom told me about the Menendez brothers. So the next time I was in L.A. I definitely made people go out of their way to take my to their house so I could see it. Ever since then we’ve been mildly connected (though, as a Coloradan, Jonbenet Ramsey is the best true crime story). Nonetheless, great show.

- Chappell Roan’s Lollapalooza Set

Every YouTube rabbit hole eventually leads me to live concert videos of my favorite artists, and for some reason this time it meant me watching Chappell Roan’s entire Lollapalooza set for a second time.

I fume every time at how good it is because I tried to go to Lollapalooza this year (spent pretty much all my money on tickets and flights and hotel rooms with people from high school I barely knew) only to find out the day after I spent all the money that I didn’t get Lollapalooza tickets, but that they had put me on an “official waitlist”. I got a full refund but that can never ease heartbreak like this.

- Tyler, the Creator’s Chromakopia album rollout

At the time of editing, Tyler’s new album comes out in two days and naturally I’m tweaking. But of course, as Ticketmaster once again proves its personal vendetta against me, I was not chosen for the verified presale. It doesn’t matter though, because Tyler’s tour manager also hates me! (he’s in Denver in February but Boston in July, so the exact wrong times)

- Halsey’s The Great Impersonator

I was not a Halsey fan growing up during her rise, but when she released her rock album If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power with Trent Reznor, I fell in love with it. The new album is still kinda rock-based in a 2000s Evanescence and Avril Lavigne way that reminds me of the music I would put on my boombox when I was 5. My favorites are Ego, Dog Years, and Lonely Is The Muse.

- Every New York Times Game

Like any good addict, these are the very first things I do when I wake up in the morning. The Connections has been awful recently though.

The Romance of Learning,Emiko P. '25,8,2024-10-23T00:00:00-04:00,"I took a test early last week for my Japanese language and culture 
        class.
      
 I woke up early that morning to study for it, scrubbing the sleep from my half-conscious brain and heavy eyelids. I cracked open my textbook and traced out kanji characters, brushed up on Japanese geography, and drilled myself on the grammar we had learned in that unit.

Kanji characters and hiragana were still swimming in the back of my mind as I scootered across the bridge to my test. It was raining, and the Charles River was a churning, thick gray. Puddles of water sprayed up onto my backpack, and I wondered if I would be taking my test just the slightest bit damp.

The test began with an interview in Japanese conducted by my professor, where a partner and I were drilled on the differences between Japanese and English spoken word. We then moved onto the written portion of the test, where I assigned pronunciations to hordes of kanji characters – the slightest deviation of curve changing the kanji’s meaning entirely. I translated vocabulary and long-winded sentences, making sure to use one of the 32 new grammar strategies we had learned in the previous units.

After I finished the test, I wandered to Hayden Library, settling onto one of the cushioned seats by the massive windows on the first floor. The windows face the river, and the infinite dimples in the Charles let me know that it was still raining. I ate a sandwich and a Honeycrisp apple that my roommate gave to me after apple picking. It all tasted particularly sweet now that my test was out of the way. I had just started to read the book Babel the day before, so I picked it up and read a bit before my next class.

Babel is a fantasy novel by R.F. Kuang about a young Chinese scholar studying at Oxford in the 1830s, navigating racial and colonialist tensions. The setting aligns similarly with actual historic events, except for the fact that this world’s energy runs off mysterious and magical silver bars that derive their power from translating words between languages. 

Thus far, the book had mostly been describing the main character’s 
        academic adventures:
      
 his sudden access to deep knowledge and his language translation research at Oxford University. Reading this book – imagining the young scholar working at a library similar to the one I was sitting in, dissecting literature, composing essays, and carefully assembling and puzzling over information like a Rubik’s cube – reminded me of myself that very morning studying for my Japanese test. In fact, in even broader terms, it reminded me of MIT.

I was reminded of my problem set for 
        16.851
      
 that I had been wading through the past two days – twelve questions focused on a different aspect of satellite communication, power design, and image processing. I was reminded of the first 
        7.014
      
 test this semester and how analyzing molecular interactions and compositions was a welcome puzzle. I was reminded that my work at MIT is an endeavor, an adventure – the equivalent of this magical version of Oxford and Babel. A part of me felt jealous of the main character, that he was lucky enough to read and devour knowledge and entirely devote himself to learning – until I realized that that is quite literally what I am doing at MIT and what I have been doing for over three years.

That realization was quickly followed by a feeling of crushing, immense gratitude for the opportunity to learn. Suddenly, studying for a test, grinding out a PSET in the library, and devoting every single brain cell to the task of understanding Thermofluids or Controls or Structures seemed like the most utterly romantic thing to do in the world. To devote yourself fully to the broadening and deepening of the mind, to dissect a problem down to its fundamental components, then to go through the mental rigor of recomposing the knowledge – so that by the end, you can sit back in your chair and understand how the world works just a bit better. All that work so that you can hold an everyday item in your hands and say, I know how this was made, or so you can look at the sky and say, I know how the Earth and Moon dance and spin. 

It truly is a gift to be a student. 

Swapping out one magical world for another, I closed my book and headed to my next class.

I walk a lonely road,Ellie F. '28,5,2024-10-20T00:00:00-04:00,"As a resident of Simmons, one of the farthest dorms from 
        Main Campus
      
, I spend a lot of time walking. But “a lot of time” is far too vague. When do I need to leave my room if I want to make it to class (mostly) on time? What routes do I walk on a regular basis? Which do I walk on a whim? To answer such burning questions, I started using a stopwatch to time some of the walks I’ve made.

Simmons to Building 45: 11 minutes, 43 seconds

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I take 
        18.c06
      
 in Building 45 at 11 am. Building 45 has a beautiful glass exterior, and as I enter, the all-wood space opens up to a giant staircase that I run up, two steps at a time. The colorful squares covering the walls on each side shimmer as I sprint past.

As the school year progresses, I find myself leaving Simmons for class later and later. I wake up just in time to catch breakfast, which closes at 10 am. I spend the rest of my time getting ready, reading my emails, checking my schedule, clearing off my desk, until—oh god it’s so late how did this happen I’m gonna be late to class oh god—

Simmons to Building 36: 9 minutes, 29 seconds

Sometimes, I know that I can make it if only I walk fast enough. I put on music, and I book it out the door and down that long stretch of Vassar St. I rush into my 
        5.111
      
 recitation breathless, five minutes past the hour. That might sound like I’m late, but on MIT time, classes start five minutes after the hour and end five minutes before. I try to slow my breathing as I find a seat.

Simmons to Building 26: 15 minutes, 12 seconds

Other times, I have moved through denial, bargaining, anger, and depression until I have accepted in my mind and soul that I will be late. I still try to walk quickly, but my heart’s just not in it. So, on this day, my walk to 
        6.1210
      
 took nearly six minutes longer than the walk to Building 36, despite nearly the same distance. 

Simmons to Building 1: 11 minutes, 18 seconds

On Mondays, I have my 
        17.50
      
 recitation at the lovely hour of 7 pm. I usually become aware of this fact at 6:30, so I speedrun dinner and hurry down Vassar St and across Mass Ave and through the turning halls of Building 1 until I burst into my classroom.

Building 1 to Simmons: 21 minutes, 47 seconds

But I can take as much time as I want coming back. I look at the signs and posters on the wall and admire models of ships on display. I take a diversion to The Alchemist and take in the way the sculpture is lit up, how the numbers and mathematical symbols cast shadows on each other.

Building 36 to Simmons: 22 minutes, 58 seconds

I love my walks back from class because it feels like time that is truly my own. I let myself stop thinking about lectures and psets and just exist on campus. I stare up at the clouds and wonder at the best way to paint them. I notice the way sunlight filters through the leaves that have now started changing colors. I stop by the display of pumpkins, gourds, and ornamental kales outside 
        Stud
      
 and read the chalk words on the pavement, advertising study breaks and frat parties, many of which are long past by now.

Simmons to Du Pont T Club Lounge: 6 minutes, 50 seconds

My PE class for the first quarter was ballroom dance! Keen readers will know I love dancing, and that won out over my general distrust of PE classes. Ballroom happens at 7 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so, much like with my 17.50 recitations, I scarf down a dinner, return my plates, and practice competitive speedwalking down the street and into the Z Center. On this night, it was raining, and I let myself take some extra time to admire the reflections of headlights in the street.

Simmons to Du Pont T Club Lounge: 6 minutes

I’ve only had to swallow my pride and actually run down most of Vassar St once. That was probably the most pure exercise I’ve gotten from PE.

Simmons to Building N52: 11 minutes, 31 seconds

I’m part of the DesignPlus learning community, where we explore design and making at our space in N52, which also holds the Morningside Academy for Design and various build teams. We have weekly lunch meetings, and on this day, I wanted to try a new route for getting there. Instead of walking straight to Mass Ave and turning along it, I crossed the railroad tracks and wandered between brick buildings until I inevitably met Mass Ave again and followed my normal path.

Building 4 Basement to Building N52: 8 minutes, 43 seconds

On Tuesday afternoons, I also have my DesignPlus seminar. My seminar is in the Forge and Foundry space below the Infinite Corridor, where we learn how to work with metals like copper, aluminum, and brass to make pendants and rings.

Through DesignPlus, I also get 24 hour access to its makerspace, and our technical instructor Bill McKenna often runs trainings on different tools and machines in it. I saw that Bill was running a sticker-making training right after my seminar, so I went over to learn how to operate the vinyl printer to create stickers featuring various Gauss puns.

when the machine cuts stickers it looks like it’s dancing

Simmons to Kresge Oval: 10 minutes, 10 seconds

Every year, the MIT Glass Lab has a glass pumpkin patch sale to raise money. I was told that the best way to get in early was to wake up at the crack of dawn to retrieve a ticket to hold my place in line, so get up early I did: I set a 6 am alarm and actually got out of bed with it. And in my hoodie and slippers, I set out towards the tent housing piles and piles of multicolored glass pumpkins to get my ticket.

the harvest is bountiful this season

Kresge Oval to Harvard Bridge to Simmons: 18 minutes, 29 seconds

I had planned to immediately go back to bed, but the sunrise was so breathtaking, I just had to walk to Harvard Bridge. I listened to Rachmaninoff as I watched the clouds turn from red to pink and reveal a thin crescent moon. And when I got too cold to keep standing there, I followed a flock of birds back to my bed.

maybe i should get up at 6 more often…

Simmons to Building E38: 17 minutes, 22 seconds

As a blogger (could you tell?), we have meetings twice a month, where we chat about our lives, upcoming events, and ideas for blogs while munching on snacks that taste twice as good because they’re free. It was at this meeting that I pitched the idea for this blog, as ordinary as it seems. 

At MIT, it can be easy to get used to my daily life, but even something as mundane as walking is filled with strange and interesting tidbits of college life. Sometimes, it just takes a stopwatch to slow down and see it all.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/building-45-800x600.jpg

Sweet summer song,Uzay G. '26,2,2024-10-19T00:00:00-04:00,"Hey folks,

it’s been a while. I’ve been very focused and not in a writing mood for the last couple months, but I’m back and I’m excited to start cooking.


Yes; as the music changes, Like a prismatic glass, It takes the light and ranges Through all the moods that pass; Dissects the common carnival Of passions and regrets, And gives the world a glimpse of all The colours it forgets. — Alfred Noyes, The Barrel Organ

This summer has been full of new colors. Last semester was not the best, and I’ve been rediscovering a lot of beauty which I wanted to share a glimpse of here.

I stayed in Boston for June-July and then traveled and saw family for August. I was continuing my research with the Isola lab on inner optimization in language models.

I met people and took in new media:


- 
I met a dude named Anton who is really into film and we watches some cool movies together. I really enjoyed Taste of Cherry by Kiarostami, although it’s a bit dark.

Firelight

I run a club called Firelight dedicated to doing a bunch of random projects and learning activities. The goal is to make a community for students to get creative outside of classes and take time to learn together. We did a lot of stuff this summer, notably the Summer 2024 Learnathon. I sent out this email:






People got together, ran activities, learned together, and met weekly to check in. I enjoyed it a lot and might do something like this again in the future.

Personally I participated in the following:

- 
weekly movie night

-

People did a lot of other things! It was really fun.

Traveling

I traveled a lot this summer. I was in the US for a while and went around/visited friends, and then I saw family both in France and Turkey.

I began by visiting a friend in New York.

We walked around a lot. We went central park and just loitered around a bunch of places, which is my favorite way of visiting a city. New York has something very pretty to it and I’d like to go there more. A few weeks later, I went to DC to visit another friend.

I had a voucher for this British airline for a cancelled flight, so I ended up going to Paris through London. This was a bit before the Olympics so it was very hectic, but I did a stop in Cambridge, UK to meet a friend there. The other Cambridge has this quaint town aesthetic ours doesn’t, and it was interesting to be there. It seems on average a bit more relaxed, but it was also summertime. The nature was pretty:



Then I somehow missed my flight from London to Paris (first time this happens), so I took an overnight bus to get home. The bus boards this ferry at 2 am and they give you food and then we crossed over into home territory. I arrived exhausted in Paris, and hung out with friends and went climbing a lot. I got cheap tickets to see the female lead boulder climbing competition!



 

Then, my large extended family (~25 ppl) all went to the mountains together. This is a tradition, as parts of my family are from these mountains in the Alps and we go there to hike and be together. Usually, almost everyday we do a hike, pack a picnic, swim in some cold lake at the middle of the hike, and then come down and make food for dinner. It was very pretty, and I feel very at peace in the mountains.




 




Then I saw the other side of my family in Turkey. I hadn’t been there in 5 years, and I worked on my turkish skills again and ate lots of great food. Turkish culture is warm and welcoming.

Here’s one of my nostalgic foods from going there as a child, these dough balls coated in syrup and cinnamon:







Research




I’ve been pretty focused on research this summer. MIT’s undergraduate research opportunities program (UROP) allows you to easily get paid for working in a lab. Copying over from my last post, since I’ve been working on this for a while:

I’m studying in-context learning, or the phenomenon where language models like ChatGPT, given sequences of the form x, f(x), x’, f(x’), … ie input-output examples of a function f in their prompt, can generalize and figure out the value of new inputs, ie predict f(x) from x.

In particular in-context learning is interesting because it underlies a lot of the reasoning ability of the best language models, and it’s still relatively poorly understood. It’s important because we want to know to what extent models learn complex inner search procedures/inner optimization goals, and we want to be careful about what those goals are. Developing a better theory for in context learning is also useful to describe model internals and make better optimization procedures.

This summer focusing solely on research was useful as I’ve been developing on a lot of random skills / localizing things I need to get better at:

- 
iterating quickly and derisking ideas rapidly

- 
being organized and clear in one’s communication, localizing the key ways people can help you and how to give them the information so that this can happen

I think navigating mentorship in ML can be a bit challenging though, because of how fast paced things go and how busy everyone is.

Once I wrap up this project, I want to take some time to think more broadly about what I want to work on.

What’s up next

I’ve been thinking about a lot of miscellaneous things, which I’ll try to blog about this semester as a teaser:

- 
my research aesthetics, what makes ML interesting and the kind of problems I want to solve

interpersonal relationships – relatedly, I’ve been thinking about navigating conflicts and expectations in any form of friendship. This is related to the question of strength and vulnerability: how much do you feel you can ask of someone? what makes that justified to you? how do these expectations get in the way of appreciating things for what they are? etc…

Other than that, I’m looking forward to this semester (which is already a decent amount underway), in particular excited for:

- I’m taking 8.05 (Quantum Physics II), it’s been really cool

- I’m taking the intermediate poetry creative writing workshop at harvard

- fun 18.408, an algorithmist’s toolkit

- doing research stuff

- fun adventures with friends (I just ran a burrito party where everyone brought an ingredient and we made one huge burrito!)




Excited to be posting more from here on out, I’m trying to get my ML post out this following week.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/firelight-1000x569.png

look at the stars,Janet G. '27,6,2024-10-17T00:00:00-04:00,"How do you raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, design the merch that defines half of campus fashion, build software that powers hackathons from around the world, and do everything else necessary to run a thousand-person hackathon? 

My friends have gotten sick of me yapping about HackMIT, the club I sold my soul to at the beginning of freshman fall and am now the director of. HackMIT is a club that helps facilitate 
        Hacking
      
in its most conventional form: we hold a hackathon, where you spend
        24 hours
      
building a project in CS and/or hardware. We run two hackathons every year — one in the spring for high schoolers (called Blueprint, and if you’re a high-schooler you’re eligible to apply!), and one in the fall for ~1000 undergraduates. Our Fall hackathon, aka HackMIT, is the biggest hackathon at MIT and one of the biggest in North America.

one of our many stunning banners

When I began writing this post, I realised that in fact HackMIT was more famous on the blogs than 
         I had remembered.
      
 However, most people haven’t talked about the process behind planning a massive event like this. Given that 
        I’m crunched for time,
      
 I’m going to do a mind-dump-way-too-comprehensive-distinctly-personal version of a “How to put on a thousand-person hackathon in six months” guide. Here we go! 

Part 1: 
        spring into summer
      


As I noted previously, I sold my soul to HackMIT at the start of freshman fall. I was head of Corporate Relations for our Blueprint hackathon, and had a pretty good time. Sent a few hundred emails, infiltrated a few Parents of Massachusetts Facebook Groups, and both memed and was memed on at the hackathon itself. 

one of the memes they made; i think the kids liked me… maybe.

For some surprising reason I decided that I did not hate the hours and hours I’d poured into this club, so I ran for director during elections and bound myself to a 1.5 year commitment to being director of HackMIT. LOL! 

We generally start planning for the hackathon around early April, when we recruit our Spring 
        class 
      
 and onboard them. We begin planning website designs, brainstorming improvements for our judging/registration infrastructure, and thinking about application logistics. We’re trying to paint a picture of the hackathon that we’re going to make happen in five to six months’ time, and for many of us who only vaguely experienced hackathons beforehand, this is pretty hard! 

I admit I am not a hackathon connoisseur — HackMIT was actually the first proper hackathon that I ever went to. I definitely felt nervous about leading the club, even if I had helped organise Blueprint beforehand, and I spent a lot of time with my co-director Albert T. ‘26 to try and understand the vision we wanted everyone to share. 

MIT’s spring term ends in May. Our fall term begins at the very start of September, and our hackathon usually happens mid-September. If you do the maths, this means that we have only 1.5 months when everyone is on campus, and the remaining work is done virtually. This is, unfortunately, PAINFUL. If you don’t remember the horrible times of online school back in 2020, think timezone differences, internet (dis)connections, and 
        Z*OM’S CONSTANT NEED TO UPDATE.
      
 I learned how to dial-in while travelling and how to inconspicuously eat my dinner at 9pm with my camera on. 

Still, we had a lot of fun — I learned a lot about what people’s favourite animals and boba orders were, and we learned all the different ways to send reactions and stickers over Zoom. It was incredible seeing everyone put in so much effort despite their busy summers; we read over 3000 applications and launched our website and our annual CTF puzzles and managed to get everything going as smoothly as we could. I still remember when we launched our website — so many people messaged us raving about the Starry Skies theme that we had designed this year. It takes a star-studded team to build a starry-themed hackathon, I guess.

Part 2: T-14

Summer slipped by through the ceaseless flow of meetings and emails. I landed after my six hour flight from London and dropped by 
        BC FLEX
      
 as soon as I arrived on campus; the overwhelming number of fresh faces and scheduled events told me welcome home in the most MIT way possible. One must imagine this 
        metaphorical firehose
      
 to be refreshing, even if the heat meant that I would’ve preferred a 
        physical firehose instead.
      
 

As you might remember, HackMIT happens mid-September. So when I landed on campus, the clock for Hack was ticking down: we were at T-14. We staffed our booth at 
        Midway
      
 to entice encourage the 
        frosh
      
 to come to our information sessions (shoutout to everyone who came and sacrificed their voices to talk nonstop for ~2 hours), ran our information sessions with the classic “FREE BOBA” marketing technique, and spent the final weekend before HackMIT interviewing people to select our incoming fall class. 

This was definitely a lot of work, but also a LOT of fun. I loved talking to everyone about why they were interested in joining HackMIT, and I will always be so grateful that so many competent and passionate people applied to join the organising team, even if it made our deliberations last over three hours. There were tough decisions and tense moments, but I’m very proud and excited for our Fall babies to work hard in Hack!

So we recruited our Fall class. T-7. We hit our fundraising goals and confirmed the scheduling. Everything was getting REAL. The weather was getting GREAT (as opposed to the awful rainstorm weather last year). Unfortunately, my co-director got SICK, but it’s okay because he survived with two days of intense sleeping, various medicines, and some soup I made (which was clearly an integral part to his speedy recovery). The last few days flew by; we chalked the sidewalks, flagged the lightpoles, and postered everywhere. Our 7000 bottles of Soylent arrived and we made sculptures out of them. People started milling around campus lugging travel suitcases and asking for directions to Lobby 7. In the blink of an eye, it was now September 13th. T-1.

Part 3: THE HACKATHON!

The night before the hackathon, Albert, Maggie L. ‘27 and I were doing our final setup checks, and Albert and I stuck around to revamp our script before the opening ceremony. We left 
        Stud
      
 at 2am, counting how many REM cycles we’d get.  

We began setup at 6am, and by the unprecedented time of 7am on a Saturday morning, we had reached a critical mass of conscious MIT students who were helping us set up. People were lugging our heavy merch boxes over to check-in, Hackers were waiting eagerly in front of the Stud, and you could catch the occasional pink hoodie running around to get sharpies and pins and whatever else people needed. I somehow landed myself three walkie talkies at once (which was more funny than it was useful), and we got everything set up. Our marketing team was decorating the Hacker lounge, which was ADORABLE, and after checking that probably nothing would burst into flames in a way that our team could not rescue, I went to do our sound check at the Kresge Auditorium. 

Opening ceremony was incredibly emotional for me. To stand on the stage and see everyone — the hackers, the team, the sponsors — was a grounding experience, and I swelled with pride to see how this all happened. Our keynote speaker this year was Annie Rauwerda, the creator behind depths of wikipedia, who had the coolest vibes and delivered a banger opening presentation. Sarah S. ‘27, who was in logs in two contexts at once, made the lovely connection to invite the 
        MIT Logs
      
 to come perform for her 
        HackMIT Logs task.
      
 

so surreal. pc Alison S. ’27, our fav resident photographer for Hack <3

And then it was the Hacking. For us, at this point, everything was set in motion; we just had to watch everything move like clockwork. The boba and Red Bull was a hit with everyone, the midnight Insomnia cookies were delicious, and I personally LOVED the therapy dogs who came to visit. Shoutout to Angela K. 27 and Jenny Y. ‘26 for compromising on the thousand-dollar petting zoo and getting us free therapy dogs instead <3 Tuxedo Tim (played by the wonderful Selena Q. ‘26) is also a typical major hit. 

I also continued a grand old tradition of being exhausted enough to sleep on a bunch of cardboard boxes as my bed. This year, Allison E. ’27 (a fellow blogger!) and Ojas G. ‘27 also visited me and gave me a much needed Mochinut & Boba break along with the sweetest postcard! I was very touched. I think they were very entertained. 

At the end of the day, we had to close the venue due to overnight restrictions. After tying everything up and doing a brief checkover of the venue, Maggie, Albert and I had some more judging logistics to confirm. Aside from 
        being shorter than Olaf,
      
 another commonality we share is the unrealised childhood dream of a sleepover with friends. Adulthood is about being mature and not doing stupid things, but to be mature one must obviously recognise the importance of fulfilling missed childhood dreams. As such, we lugged two of Hack’s many air mattresses into my room, chatted about logistics for Sunday, got sidetracked trolling Claire W. ‘27 (who lives right above me), and staggered our venue check-in shifts so we could each get four (rather than three) hours of sleep. 

Sunday morning was thankfully calm and slightly tense, given that everyone was rushing to complete their final projects. Once the project submission period ended, it was crunch time. People started milling around the tables to present and judge projects alike, and I floated around the help desk to make sure that we were able to redirect lost judges and projects. Once judging concluded, we split off into separate groups to deliberate on decisions. This year, I managed the deliberations of the HackMIT challenge prizes, while my co-director and the Mentor & Judging points Susan H. ‘27, Emily C. ‘25, and Jenny Y. ‘26 finalised the overall prizes. We got everything together, and suddenly we were ready for the closing ceremony! 

The closing ceremony was a different flavour of emotional from opening. Alison S. ‘27, our resident photography talent and Finance head, spent two hours during the hackathon to edit together a BEAUTIFUL closing ceremony video. She edited “HACKMIT” to parody Chappell Roan’s smash hit “HOT TO GO”, and I’m honestly a little embarrassed to admit how I was tearing up while the song was telling us to touch our toes. 
        Ridonkulous
      
 did a great job hyping up the crowd, and we did a cute little swag throw (with mixed reception). Our winners were very energetic and it was very cute to see the products demo’ed. I think our projects were very cool this year :) 

Once everyone had left after the closing ceremony, I blobbed on the floor for a while from exhaustion, and then picked myself up so that we could facilitate cleanup. There wasn’t much left, thanks to the hackers who helped us clean out most of the trash before the closing ceremony, so instead we mostly just had a lot of fun being inefficient with pack up. I relived my Hack ‘23 experience of being carted by Maggie around the Ice Rink (and returning the favour), our Marketing and CR teams made “the Sponsor Shirt” with every single leftover sticker we could find plastered onto a single merch shirt, and we donated a few hundred bottles of Soylent (a feat considering that we started with 7000) and Red Bull to the Banana Lounge. We packed everything up, took our sentimental team photos, and that was the end of HackMIT 2024.

part 4: the aftermath

Oops, this turned out to be a pretty long post; it’s been a long few months. I’m proud of what we did. We received a lot of appreciation and gratitude, and I genuinely believe our team deserves it. Everyone was great — from our lovely sponsors who ask us about our days to the hackers who help us clean up, it’s always great to know how many kind people are out there! But as I told everyone at our organising team dinner, the team will always have a special place in my heart. 

team photo <3

A lot of people frame college as the time to prepare themselves for the post-college life, but there are also many people at this school who will do something just for the sake of it. The legacy of HackMIT is not something pre-professional — we just hold two 24 hour fun and goofy events every year — but we spend the entire year preparing for them. I could go on and on about the sacrifice and effort that everyone put in, all the late night calls that devolve into gossip sessions and life complaints, all the moments of comedy that feed our private meme slideshow. This hackathon happened because of all of our team’s hard work and I will be endlessly grateful for them, because at the end of the day, they are the people who made it happen. The 
        thousands of emails,
      
 battling Illustrator for asset designs, all the pull requests and merges. This is my thank you to every team member, for reminding me that we can build a community of people who are all so competent and dedicated to a cause because they believe in it.

Of course, the epitome of the team member comes in the form of our Committee Heads. 

Maggie L. ‘27 has been there for me since 
        day one,
      
 and as the Logistics head she battled through massive spreadsheets and stayed with us for the worst of it. Special shoutout to her for not crashing the car and killing both of us when she drove all the way up from San Jose to meet up with me at Stanford <3 

Claire W. ‘27, our amazing Corporate Relations head, brought so much energy with her crazy ideas to funnel sponsorships. Our conversations about sponsor logistics until 3am, even while both of us were slightly sick and dying in Oxford, definitely pulled through to push us even beyond the fundraising goal. 

Alison S. ‘27, our Finance head, has been another integral part of my HackMIT experience, with her incredible reliability and photography talent. You would think that she is a typical high school junior grinding for college apps with her 7 clubs and 4 exec positions, but her atypical passion and powerhouse-ness drives her through everything to pull off some of the craziest projects I know. 

Andrew L. ‘? and Richard C. ‘26 as our incredible DevOps heads were the unit of all time, and I’ve been so honoured to work alongside them for the entirety of my Hack experience. Their calmness was incredibly anchoring amidst the rest of us hyperactive heads, and I will always remember the number of times when I would wake up and they had pushed out some incredible feature (by virtue of another all-nighter). 

Kimberly W. ‘26, or the insom(a)niac Marketing Head as we love to call her, has the most incredible view on design, and really pushed the branding of HackMIT this year to new (starry!) heights. Her honesty and dedication reminds me of a value system that sometimes the Tech School education overlooks: it is worth it to make sacrifices for something bigger than yourself, because it is meaningful to you and that is enough. She also taught me that in fact you can actually run a whole committee while doing a 
        MISTI 
      
abroad in Armenia, as long as you just… don’t sleep for the most part.  

This leaves the people who cannot be really defined as anything in HackMIT, because in a way they ARE HackMIT. 

i’d just like to point out how i’m basically the same height as him. nothing else

In the context of HackMIT 2024, whenever I say us, it mostly means me and Albert, my co-Director for this year. As co-directors, we operate as a unit and make all our announcements as a collective — we even make three-person group chats to send messages to any individual team member. 

While we were walking back at 3am, after finally finishing up with all the logistics of HackMIT, Albert observed how it’s so funny that every director spends only six months working with their co-director, but it always feels like forever at the end of it. It’s not easy to dedicate 10-20 hours a week to this cause, all 52 weeks of the year, for two years straight — especially at a school like MIT that demands constant excellence through the technical culture and challenging classes. Still, it selects for a specific sort of person, who is willing to confront this risk and give everything to it anyway. I’ve seen many of my other friends who run clubs have this same dedication, and I feel incredibly lucky that HackMIT is structured in a way that we can share the load. 

From personal experience, it’s hard to build truly deep friendships in college. The number of people you meet in college become an incentive to bobble around and meet new people, especially if you’re still young and full of energy. Time is also crucial for friendship, and MIT squeezes the time out of you through painful problem sets and challenging classes. This is not a post about the value of intellectual discipline; what I will say instead is that our workload pushes us to choose and prioritise things that we truly believe in. 

As directors, we choose to work with each other for so long because both of us care about the cause enough to dedicate so much of our college life to it. The mutual respect and admiration it curates builds out friendships that last far beyond College. We were lucky enough to organise a 
        mega-director’s
      
 dinner while I was in San Francisco, and it was so awesome to see the legacy of directors who are still good friends to this day because of the time they had spent together. This sacrifice is all worth it, and for me thus far, it was worth it because Albert was there to guide me through both Hack and life beyond this club. I’ve told him this so many times, but again, thank you for everything. I’ll miss him a lot as he enjoys retirement, but we already pinky promised (like 5 times, actually…) that we’d be friends forever and now we’re adults so obviously this promise is now legally binding. 

So, how DO you raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, design the merch that defines half of campus fashion, build software that powers hackathons from around the world, and do everything else necessary to run a thousand-person hackathon? 

You find a family of some of the most talented, dedicated, passionate people you’ve ever met. And then you do it.

love in the time of unlimited data,Kai V. '25,2,2024-10-16T00:00:00-04:00,"In Milan I was constantly toeing the line between speaking solely in English, which I feared would make me seem like an entitled American who thought the whole world should cater to the dominance of their own language, and being so insistent on communicating in Italian that it posed a legitimate obstruction to getting anything across at all. Having lacked the foresight to grind a Duolingo course on the flight there, my half-baked strategy was to affect a sort of sheepish self-awareness—as I butchered every Italian word that I directed at waitstaff, cashiers, and train operators alike—that I hoped didn’t cross the line into flippancy towards their language. I couldn’t tell either way, because whether I said grazie with total confidence or none at all, they’d switch to English immediately and unsmilingly: “Okay, bye.”

On the first afternoon, I walked into the least intimidating-looking cafe I saw in the neighborhood of my hotel, asked for a cappuccino, and pointed at the VEGETARIANO option under an unidentifiable menu item. I was determined not to use Google Translate, in part because my phone was at 3% battery. The man behind the counter moved to cut me a slice of vegetable-topped focaccia and motioned at the bread with the triangular pizza server to interrogate how large I wanted it to be. I kept saying “yes” no matter where he placed the blade: I was hungry and just wanted any amount of food.

I was visiting Milan to attend ECCV, the European Conference on Computer Vision. But I had a couple days free first, so I spent the first afternoon on sightseeing: basilicas, castles, museums. Finally I visited the Duomo, Milan’s central cathedral, which was the first architecture I’d ever seen to literally take my breath away—spiked by hand-carved spires rising to industrial heights, topped by life-size granite figures, the impossible product of six centuries of human labor.

Near the city center, a woman came running up to me and asked: “Español? Ingles?” I said yes to ingles, my Spanish was old and rusty. But she kept talking in Spanish anyway. She was a lost tourist who wanted to get to the canals. I didn’t know where they were any better than her, and I told her that: “No sé dónde están los canales.”

She gave a genuine laugh, maybe at the slowness of my Spanish dredged up word by word, but I think partly with relief upon communicating with someone who spoke her language, albeit badly. Then she thanked me and left.

I realized right after that although the interaction had lifted my spirits, I could have easily helped her by opening Google Maps and letting her type in the destination. In my selfish haste to achieve some idea of human-to-human connection through speaking the same language, I had actually failed her.

A few of my labmates and I rented a motorboat to go on Lake Como, which was less than an hour’s drive from Milan. The rental company gave us the boat with minimal guidance (“do not try driving too fast close to shore or the police will see you with their lasers and will give you a fine”), and then we were barefoot sprawling out on the deck while handing off driving, the white hull cutting through this jade green water that had a real gemstone-like quality to it, cloudy and sharp and glinting in the sun. Shouldered by enormous bluffs, the Alps blue in the distance, it was the most gorgeous place I’d been in my entire life.

The lake was really big, something like twenty miles tip-to-tail. We’d speed through the middle for a few minutes, the top of the boat lifting out of the water with how fast we were going, wind whipping my hair back. Then we’d see a castle or something on the bank and go up to it and putter along drinking in the old moss-covered dark-stone historicity.

“Can we swim?” I said. I’d brought my swim shorts to Milan because somehow I’d assumed that every Italian town worth visiting must be a seaside village of some sort. I’d pictured myself taking a dip in the ocean every morning before the conference. It was only after I arrived in Milan, swim shorts in tow, that I opened Google Maps and noted with horror that Milan was right in the middle of the landmass, several hours’ drive to the ocean.

At my request, we drove as far from both shores as we could, until the apricot-colored buildings dotting each bank became small and indistinguishable. My labmate turned off the engine; as it revved down we were enveloped in a silence punctuated only by the occasional drone of another faraway motorboat. I took off my clothes—I’d worn the shorts underneath—and dove into the water. Far from any landmass, flat turquoise stretching forever in every direction, it felt like I had been plunged untethered into the center of the universe, submerged in a warm sweet core where I could watch everything else happening without touching it.

We found, afterwards, a small restaurant—one little kitchen, one table outside—high in the hills, the kind of thing where you had to take a winding cobblestone path up narrow stairs to get to the unlit restroom. An Italian mother and daughter prepared our food—we ordered basically the entire one-page menu—while the father fed bits of it to a dog. We watched the sun set while eating from a charcuterie board. I felt tired of eating so much dairy, having been functionally vegan in Boston, but it was offered with such care that in some way I enjoyed it anyway. For the whole evening we ate and chatted and the mother would emerge from the kitchen at odd intervals to drape more blankets over our shoulders as night cooled the mountains. Late at night this other lady came by who visibly exerted greater authority over the dog than the father, who had been trying with little success to get it to sit on command. “It’s time to go,” the lady said with a snap of her fingers, and the dog trotted away obediently, meat still dangling from its jaws.

After presenting my poster the next morning in the 
        ecology workshop
      
, I drifted around and found myself in a workshop on hand pose and dynamics. These researchers from Meta built a big sphere you would put your hand in, with hundreds of LEDs inside which turned on and off individually. Using this sphere, they could farm a lot of training data on how hands looked in different lighting conditions. “We realized people don’t want a cartoon of themselves in the metaverse,” they said. “They want their real bodies in the metaverse.”

They played a clip of a disembodied head talking, cut off below the neck; then the same clip cut off below the torso to illustrate the difference: “Our goal is to perfectly recreate all real-life communication in the digital world, and hands are very important for communication.” They needn’t have explained this. We were in Italy; everyone around us was gesticulating wildly at all times.

Another workshop covered large-scale video object segmentation. This meant recognizing the boundaries around distinct objects present in a video. In particular I was impressed by Meta’s Depth Anything model, which took a video as input and predicted the distance of each point of each surface from the eye of the viewer. The second version had just debuted and showed drastic improvements over the original—for example, the spokes on a bike wheel could be distinguished now, whereas before they would blur into the same plane. The researchers showed an example of an application: you would be able to rotate your phone on a call with your family and their background would shift with an exaggerated parallax that implied a depth not obvious over non-augmented video.

That night, I bid my labmates goodbye after getting gelato together and walked back towards my hotel. A breathless teenager rolled up to me on his scooter. “Casa Milan?” he panted. “Uhh,” I said. I got out my phone and found the place on Google Maps and handed it to him. He rotated the phone around to see what street he should go down. “Thank you very much,” he said emphatically, in his thick Italian accent.

That was the only time I made someone else’s life better in Milan, and my humanity had nothing to do with it. I had simply acted as a lossless enough interface between a human with a need and a phone with unlimited data.

There’s a difference between kindness as utility and kindness as connection. You’d think kindness as utility is what really matters: this kind of altruism improves our collective odds of survival and entails being selfless and rational enough to do what really improves the other person’s life instead of what makes you feel better. On the small scales of day-to-day survival that we’re evolved for, these align: picking mites out of each other’s hair, taking care of each other’s kids, accomplishing as two what we cannot as one. This is the kind of altruism we can augment by becoming more capable, more equipped to help, more prudent and attentive and understanding. More ubiquitous access to more powerful technology enables this kindness-as-utility: I can Uber my friend home, use Google Translate to have a real and productive conversation with someone whose language I don’t speak, or offer Google Maps to a lost teenager.

But a subtler flavor of kindness comes from trying to connect as humans, oversights and limitations and all. Offering cheese because that was all they had for a vegetarian; eating cheese even though I hate cheese because it showed they really cared about me. Tossing a cumulative steak’s worth of meat to the neighbor’s dog. My labmate giving me his sweater after I swam, not realizing its sleeve was dripping wet, only making me colder. Someone yelling telefono! Telefono! at me on the train, seriously alarming me at first until I realized they were trying to warn me my phone might fall out of my pocket. (Actually it’s just a really bulky phone.) Whether anyone apart from the dog gained utility from these interactions is questionable, but still they’re some of the moments I remember most fondly for the bright flashes of human care I felt, the instinctive, imperfect kindness, impossible to quantify or optimize towards.

These random, unpredictable interactions are why I try sometimes to avoid using Translate or using Maps or even charging my phone. But it’s harder to justify these decisions when they lead to increased inefficiency for everyone involved, even as the inefficiency, the time spent intentionally considering each other’s needs, forms the crux of human connection. With technology it is easier to provide utility to each other, either by achieving the goal of a given interaction more easily, sticking points of human interaction smoothed over by optimized text interfaces, or by saving each other time by skipping over the human entirely.

I could imagine a fully virtual ECCV by 2028. After all, by any conceivable loss function, this is the best future we can optimize towards. We’ll spare the collective thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions released from a hundred planes jetting to Italy just for us to bumble around, confusing waitstaff and standing in front of paper posters and waxing lyrical about how good we’ll all have it once this is simulated away. The cafe server will size my focaccia with kind, weathered hands holding a scuffed pizza server, with a latency of just a millisecond, two or three if my ping is bad, but in any case far faster than my jet-lagged brain could in person. The simulated focaccia will identify the precise neuronal clusters mapping to a savory creamy warm sensation and prod them in pulses of pleasure far beyond what the real life bread could deliver, which had been cold in the middle, cheese solid and tasteless, made marginally enjoyable only by the fact that I’d stepped off the plane an hour before. When I go sightseeing, the spires of the Duomo will reach so high into the sky (with the sensation of depth augmented by Meta’s Depth Anything v7) that at a glance I’ll fall to my knees weeping, the entire thread of human history funneling into my mind like a skull-shattering screwdriver. With my face and hands recreated faithfully, perhaps even augmented so that I don’t break eye contact or fidget with my watch like I do in real life and instead can give full attention to the person across from me, I’ll gesture and speak animatedly about my research in front of an interactive display rather than a static poster. During dinner with my labmates afterwards, I’ll think of their perfect presences with a fondness exceeding any feeling I could conjure now. “Do you remember back when this was held in person in Milan?” we’ll laugh. “It was so terrible. I got sick every time on the flight back home.” At the mention of a time when we suffered exhaustion and illness to see each other, at the thought of the people I failed before artificial augmentation made me wiser and kinder, at the memory of cold sweet water piercing my abdomen and the ecstasy of being alone with my friends in the center of the world, my heart will swell with the blood of machine compassion.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_20240928_182503438_HDR-400x533.jpg,1
Taking the L,Kayode D. '27,2,2024-10-16T00:00:00-04:00,"I never wrote a blog recapping last semester. I thought about it quite a bit this summer and I think I wrote a few drafts but none of them really ever came to anything. Among all the thoughts, only one feels all that important to share with applying students: taking the L.

Y’all, I’ve taken so many L’s.

Physics L

The summer before you come to MIT, you have to take a math assessment. This essentially assess your skills and recommends a math course for you. Your advisor is also informed of this suggestion. It’s through a system called MITx, which is like a big interactive textbook a lot of Psets are done through. I did well in Calc BC in high school, so I didn’t study for it. I already know the material, right? I can make up excuses like that I didn’t know the syntax of MITx, but the short of it is that I failed. MIT Test #1: failed. Of all the possible classes:

Math: 
        18.01
      
, 
        18.02
      
, 
        18.01a/18.02a
      
, and 
        18.022
      


Physics: 
        8.01
      
, 
        8.02
      
, and the accursed 8.01L [Physics Long – same as 8.01 but goes an extra month in IAP].

I got recommended 18.01 and 8.01L, but that had to be a mistake, right?

When I met with my advisor, I told him I wanted to take 18.02 and 8.01 but he strongly suggested I take 18.01 and 8.01L[DUN DUN DUNNN]. I tried to argue that I could handle it and the assessment was a fluke, but settled to take 18.01 and 8.01 and only drop if physics became too hard. Which it did. The people I did work with were already so accustomed and clocked into the material that they flew through it and I sort of rode their coattails by Psetting together and not really learning the material on my own. I bombed the first exam and got an email asking if I wanted to switch to 8.01L. On thanksgiving day, I begrudgingly agreed. I took the L.

8.01L felt like something out of the Breakfast Club. 8.01 met in a large conference room next to the 
        Outfinite
      
and had hundreds of students in it, taught by some of the most well known and beloved professors at the institution. 8.01L met in the basement under the Stata building and had 20 people in it. Let that sink in, 20 people. I felt like a failure! In my mind I had sunk to the lowest point you could at MIT, to the dumbest class there was for the most fundamental topic!

But just like the swim class (another common Kayode L), I was so wrong!! 8.01 L was 1000% the correct choice for me. The class wasn’t anything different, it was just the same material with better pacing. The class was split up and had enough professors and TAs that every pair had someone that could help with questions and walk though problems that we didn’t understand (of which there were many). And the small class size? Amazing! Not only was everyone on equal footing when we approached problems, but some of these people have become my closest friends at MIT! This class isn’t for “dumb” students at all, it is quite literally a normal physics class in every way. From the outside, it is just MIT physics with an extra month (which just meant more physics experiments and 
         a final project that was more fun
      
 than it was hard.) I have plenty of friends who have told me they regret taking 8.01 over 8.01L, and that they wish they could have taken the better paced and less intense 8.01L if they could go back. Also, the final isn’t in December with everything else so that’s less stress, too.

My point: This L wasn’t that bad.

Common Coding L

As a course 2A6 I am studying Mechanical Engineering with Computer Science, so I wanted to take the first coding class, 6.100. There’s 2 options for this:

- 6.100A / 6.100B are 2 coding classes that fill one semester. If you don’t need 6.100B (not many courses do) then you finish the class in half a semester, but it’s a very intense few weeks unless you are very comfortable coding.

- 6.100L is the class for if you’ve never coded before. The same amount of material but spread out over a full semester.

I had done enough coding in high school to feel comfortable signing up for 6.100A, but quickly realized I would be better suited for 6.100L. I signed up for 
        5 classes this semester
      
 so I took the L and switched to 6.100L. You have to decide this switch by the end of the very first week, and once again, I felt dumb for swapping. And THEN once again I realized that this class isn’t dumb, it’s quite literally a normal intro to coding class. We fill an entire lecture hall, too, so I wasn’t alone, and it’s the same amount of work, with only 5 Psets for the whole semester!

Once again: This L was better in the long run.

Broken Computer L

It was during my first and only test in 6.100 A that I realized with horror that my computer’s keyboard had stopped working. Everything worked fine except for the number keys, which only let me use 5 and 6. So I had to do an entire timed coding exam with only the numbers 5 and 6 (I would go 6-5+6-5+6-5 to get 3, or have to copy it from somewhere on the page). This has been infuriating, and the rough draft of this blog had things like “eighteen-oh-one-a/b” written in place of numbers. I got a 50% on that one.

This past week I had ANOTHER coding exam, so I got a keyboard from the admissions office to use in case my numbers stopped working again. But that couldn’t save me from what was coming. I opened my computer an hour before the exam to the Black Screen of Death. My cursor was visible and could move, but no button or click did anything, not even the power button. I was screwed.

Luckily, I remembered a message I had seen in passing on the blogger Slack channel, where Ceri R. was offering to give away her old laptop that she didn’t need anymore. I quickly messaged and went to claim it from her. Success! I took the exam and am now typing on said computer. After the exam, I went to the IS&T tech help desk to see if they could save the non-backed up files on it, and the guy at the desk (I kid you not) just held down the power button longer than I did and the computer turned off and back on again. So I go to the #1 tech school in the world but I can’t restart my computer? Major L.

Music Theory L

This one stings the most.

I love music. With a passion. I have 4 half written blogs where I just talk about the music I like and why I like it so much (that will hopefully see the light of day soon). I took 21M.301 – Harmony and Counterpoint I this semester. This is the first real music theory class, after 21M.051 – Fundamentals of Music. I felt I was ready; I know scales, I know chords, I should be good!

But if the rest of this blog hasn’t made it abundantly clear, I took another L and I wasn’t fully prepared. I underestimated what I was lacking from not playing a melodic instrument. The class focused on a thing called Partimento (which is hard to explain), and I realized I was the only percussionist in a class of classical musicians and acapella singers. We had to write melodies, and while my rhythm and percussion was beyond fire, the musicality of my melodies were lacking when compared to what they should have been, and my professor reached out.

He thought I should drop the class this semester, and take his Fundamentals of Music class to prepare for retaking .301 next fall. I was extremely disappointed with the situation and myself. This class was taking so much of my time and I wasn’t even doing well in it. And I love music!! But I remembered something I saw on a t shirt a while back:

It was on a free shirt we got at orientation. The quote read “There are no traffic jams along the extra mile.” This was true for the Swim Test, and the Physics Class, and now Music. I shouldn’t fear taking the time to learn the “long” way. After all, MIT is a marathon, not a sprint!

So I dropped music theory. Now I have a lot more free time, but I’m planning on coming back to the class next fall to try again.

L: accepted. 😔

So what’s the takeaway of all of this?

I think all MIT students fear failure to some capacity. I’m scared of trying new things because I’m afraid of being bad at it. Which yeah, sounds dumb on paper but its true. I can sit in a room with 
        thirty
      
 MIT students— some of the brightest students in the world, and the professor can ask a question and no one will answer. It’s not because no one 
        knows the answer
      
, but no one wants to try and be wrong in front of everyone…except for people in the front row. These people know the room is full but they can’t see it. All they see is the professor and the board. I think that when you learn to tune out distractions and forget about comparing yourself to others, you can start to actually thrive. Comparison is the thief of joy, after all.

I fail. A lot. I have little or big failures every day and that’s ok. It takes a lot of trying to get through life, and a lot of failing, too. The Bible even says in James 1:2-4, “My brothers and sisters, be very happy when you are tested in different ways. You know that such testing of your faith produces endurance. Endure until your testing is over. Then you will be mature and complete, and you won’t need anything.” This refers to being tested in faith, and it applies to a lot of kinds of tests, too. Because I went through the failures I did, I learned a lot more than I think I would have had I never failed. 

And this reminds me of another thing I say a lot! I saw it on Instagram, and it said that “The man who loves to walk will go farther than the man who loves the destination.” Learn to love the journey more than where you’re going and you’ll go a whole lot farther! Then you won’t be disappointed if you don’t exactly hit the target, because you’ll have gone on a great walk. Mmm, put that in your happy meal!

Ok, I’m done with the Dad quotes. Go fail and learn and grow into the person you want to be! Or don’t, but learn from it anyways.

how the first midterms actually were,Aiden H. '28,7,2024-10-15T00:00:00-04:00,"Contrary to popular (and probably well-founded) belief, I once was psychic. Not only did I successfully predict the 2021 Pantone Color of the Year (with a Google Slideshow as evidence) and
        COVID-19
      
, but I believed in my abilities so much that I genuinely go around telling people and even wrote college essays on the topic.

Tragically, I am here today to confirm that I have lost my powers.

MIT is infamous for humbling people, so when our
        first midterm season
      
 rolled around I was casually prepared to use the phrase “C’s get degrees” and move on with my life as soon as possible. But–in the least ignorant way possible–wow! these exams are really hard and mentally draining! When predicting my scores, I failed (kinda?) a test I thought I aced, passed a test I thought I got a 30% on, and had no clue on the others? Never did I think that even the wrath of MIT could shake my solid foundation of psychism, but I stand dumbfounded.

Fortunately, I am taking 3
        GIRs
      
 and a class essentially everyone takes anyway, so I’m here to explain how your first midterm seasons at MIT will realistically go, class by class, and spread the TMZ-worthy insider-deets about what our exams are actually over.

 

18.02 (Multivariable Calculus)

My first midterm was for 18.02, which has been my favorite class so far so I wasn’t particularly stressed? I haven’t taken multivariable calc before, but that turned out to not put me at a disadvantage because the class started with a mini linear algebra unit instead to introduce random concepts we would need for the rest of the class.

Lecture is three times a week (Tuesday/Thursday/Friday) with
        recitations
      
on Monday/Wednesday. Psets for this class are the shortest I have with a mix of online and written out problems that are due on Tuesday nights.

What was covered:

- Vectors Addition & scaling Dot product & cross product Vector projections


- Addition & scaling

- Dot product & cross product

- Vector projections

- Matrices Multiplication, determinants, and inverses Linear transformations


- Multiplication, determinants, and inverses

- Linear transformations

- Linear Combinations Linear dependence Span and basis Systems of equations


- Linear dependence

- Span and basis

- Systems of equations

- Eigen-stuff Eigenvectors and eigenvalues 2×2 characteristic polynomials


- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues

- 2×2 characteristic polynomials

- Complex Numbers Arithmetic of complex numbers Polar form/euler’s formula


- Arithmetic of complex numbers

- Polar form/euler’s formula

Looking at it in list form looks like a lot considering there was only 8 lectures before the exam, but the class runs really smooth and a lot is covered each lecture, so there was no “we literally never learned this” panic like there was for other classes.

Like most GIR exams, since the class was so large (>400), we had the split the exam location. Half were in
        26-100
      
, but I was in
        Walker Memorial
      
, which gave me the amazing opportunity to walk along the river and develop a deep anxiety before the test!

In all seriousness, the hype around the “first midterm” and how hard MIT is definitely psyched me out for this test. I’m fortunate to not typically have test anxiety, but the amount of sweat that dripped on my paper during the exam was criminal. Was the test hard? No. Was it different from any practice problem or 
        pset
      
? No. Did I choke anyway? Of course!

I walked back to my dorm fully believing I got a 30% and immediately started busting out laughing with my roommate about how awful we felt we did.

In the end, we both passed and had days of nerves and melodrama over nothing, and this class 
        continues to be my favorite.
      


 

17.41 (Intro to International Relations)

The same Friday as my 18.02 exam, I had my first paper due for my
        HASS class
      
.

Technically this wasn’t a midterm exam, but it was still a larger assignment at the same time with the same weight in my grade. A lot of HASS classes will actually have one midterm exam and one final exam with a few papers sprinkled through the class. Since this is my
        CI-H
      
, I count the paper and my suffering equally as much.

Except I actually wouldn’t call it suffering because I generally enjoy this class? I did debate in high school so I have a general understanding of the concepts we’re covering in class, just not in a formalized and academic way. The first half of the class is the overview of the main three theories of international relations, with the first two papers being us having to apply them to current international news, and the second half will be issues/dilemmas/other parts of international relations that are important (climate change, nuclear weapons, proxy wars, etc.).

The prompt for this paper was: “Having read the US National Security Strategy, assess how well the United States is adhering to its own strategy. Offer at least two examples of international relations situations where the United States behavior supports the position taken in the essay. Provide a counterexample to the stated position and explain why it  doesn’t sway the ultimate assessment.”

Despite being very tame, in a true procrastinator’s fashion, I started the paper the day before and still managed to finish it on time and clutch a passing grade. Not the most applicable class to others unless you’re going to major/minor/concentrate in
        course 17
      
, but an untold truth of MIT is that even in the middle of all the psets and midterms, I will still have to open MLA Citation Machine.

 

5.111 (Principles of Chemical Science)

The following Monday I had the dreaded 5.111 exam. The general consensus across the class, including the
        upperclassmen
      
, was that this was where we were gonna all fail.

Naturally, I decided the weekend was to cram.

Except I didn’t (oops!). I studied for a decent amount the day before with the exam review the professor posted, but unlike the psets for the class, it was very emphasized the test was going to be conceptual and almost entirely long answer, which I find harder to study for because it’s not the same as memorizing equations or practicing a specific type of problem.

The class structure isn’t specifically noteworthy: lecture Monday/Wednesday/Friday, recitation on the days between, and psets are due Friday nights.

What was covered:

- Atomic Structure Models of the atom Cathode ray experiment Gold foil experiment


- Models of the atom

- Cathode ray experiment

- Gold foil experiment

- Electromagnetic waves Photoelectric effect Particle in a box Spectroscopy Schrodinger’s Equation


- Photoelectric effect

- Particle in a box

- Spectroscopy

- Schrodinger’s Equation

- Hydrogen Atom Wavefunctions Quantum numbers Orbital nodes Electron probability densities


- Quantum numbers

- Orbital nodes

- Electron probability densities

I took two years of IB chemistry in high school and by no means was some chemistry godsend, but I assumed coming into the class that I would know enough to not have to break my back over the class. But this first section of the class really shows why MIT doesn’t give credit for high school chem, because never did I talk about light’s wave-particle duality as in-depth as I needed to for this exam. It wasn’t overly complicated or difficult, just a lot of really niche concepts that you have to be able to explain in
        extraneous situations
      
.

Leaving the test, though, I was sure I passed with a near-perfect score. I answered every question, finished early, and was never confused–the polar opposite of the 18.02 exam.

The surprise on my face when I received a
        failing grade
      
was priceless. My first MIT blindside had occurred, and it was only two days before my worst fear…

 

8.01 (Physics I)

What I would do to not have to do physics. Tax fraud? Arson? Casual murder? All on the table.

One time I was convinced I wanted to be a physicist, but then I took AP Physics C: Mech in high school and it was genuinely
        the worst class I’ve ever been in.
      
 I’m just genuinely not interested in physics. I understand that it is super important and I get why it’s a GIR, but it also makes me slightly homicidal and those two things just have to coexist.

Considering I took mechanics in high school and didn’t entirely fail, I expected to feel like a solid 5/10 in this class. By the first exam, though, I was sure I was going to have to take this class eight times, fail each one, and eventually never graduate. The concepts aren’t that different from mechanics for the first exam, but pretty much 75% of the AP content I remember was covered in 3 weeks and the extent of the problems was 1000% greater. What is really different is where the emphasis for the problems is. Whereas AP was “get the right answer”, 8.01 is “do you understand this through vector decomposition” and “can you use differential analysis to derive this equation”.

The structure of the class is kind of a flipped-learning style, which MIT calls “TEAL”. Unlike the other classes, there is not one lecture section for everybody, but a bunch of smaller classes that meet with different professors. We watch lecture style videos on our own time that are due on Sunday and Tuesday of each week, and then you meet with your section twice a week to review the video content and do practice problems with your group. Then on Fridays every section meets and completes 2-3 problems with their table group that count towards the week’s pset, which are due Wednesdays.

What was covered:

- Kinematics linear(? is that what non-rotational is called?) and rotational


- linear(? is that what non-rotational is called?) and rotational

- Newton’s Laws Constraint/pulley/block systems Identifying third law pairs Pressure, buoyancy, resistive, and spring forces


- Constraint/pulley/block systems

- Identifying third law pairs

- Pressure, buoyancy, resistive, and spring forces

- “Circular motion” I still have no clue


- I still have no clue

Looking at all this doesn’t look that bad, and when I started reviewing I noticed that too? One of the professors released a 3 hour review video that pretty much did near-identical free response questions to the exam, and I vow to protect that man with my life because that was the most educational and mind-opening three hours of my life.

Coming out of the exam, I also felt shocking fine? And when I got my grade I also did shockingly fine?

Somehow the class I hated the most I got the highest score in.

 

6.100A (Intro to CS Programming with Python)

The same day as the 8.01 exam, I had a “midterm” for 6.100A. Except it isn’t really a midterm because this class doesn’t really have exams. The class is a 6-credit, half-semester class with near-weekly psets that take anywhere from 1-8 hours and 4 “microquizzes” instead of midterms, which are 25 minute in-class coding quizzes every week or two. Like the homework, the quizzes vary from the easiest problems I’ve ever seen to questions I genuinely have no clue how to answer.

Since the class moves really fast, it looks like a lot of content, but if you have any coding experience, the first half or even the whole class will be pretty easy.

You might think you have no interest in coding or
        course 6
      
, so you’ll never have to worry about this class.

Wrong. Want to do aero/astro? 6.100A. Archaeology? 6.100A. Materials Science? Nuclear Science? Brain and Cognitive Sciences? All of them. Everyone has to. You can’t escape it (unless you do, like, chemistry).

What was covered:

- Objects, types, and variables

- String operations, conditionals, loops, enumeration

- Approximation/bisection search

- Decomposition/abstraction Functions Scope


- Functions

- Scope

- Tuples, lists, dictionaries, mutation, aliasing

- Exceptions, testing, and debugging

- Recursion

- Classes and data attributes

I actually passed this quiz (which I cannot say for all of them.) and I was definitely more focused on the 8.01 exam, so there’s not much to say except that it happened and the next quiz was already a week later.

 

Overall the experience wasn’t as traumatic as people like to make it out to seem, and I wouldn’t even call it comparable to AP weeks in high school (but that might be because I’m in the easiest classes rn). And now that I’ve procrastinated three hours by writing this, there’s nothing to do now but start studying for
        the next ones

Pictures from a Month into Classes,Richard O. '28,8,2024-10-14T00:00:00-04:00,"MIT is a weird school. Seriously. If I asked you to picture a normal scene on this campus, you would probably be wrong (very, very, wrong). In the past month, I’ve done everything from holding a ferret in our hallway to climbing a rock wall on the side of a student-built wooden fort next to a 360-degree student-built gyroscope ride in the middle of one of our fields. I’ve seen students participate in a petting zoo in front of our dorms and watched my roommate smash random electronics on the sidewalk with a metal pipe. I’ve consumed an inhumane amount of boba which seems to be the number-one catered item for all events on campus and casually stood in an elevator and spoke with a co-founder of AirBNB who was giving a talk on a different floor (and I had no idea who he was the entire time we were in the elevator) – but this sense of unseriousness while having fun is one of my favorite things about this school because it reminds me that formality is something we don’t actually have to follow when we don’t want to.

So with that, I’m going to try my best to give you all a glimpse of my fun, ridiculous, and intense experiences these past few months…but with pictures (because I like pictures).

 

Part 1: Early Move-In

- So it turns out Virginia is a fairly long drive from MIT and driving there starting at 1 AM on a Tuesday isn’t ideal… but either way, I was too excited to complain.

 

Part 2: SIE FPOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

- As you can probably tell from the title, this part of my orientation period was my favorite and for good reason. During the summer before move-in, MIT opens applications for these things called 
         FPOPs 
      
 which basically allow students to move in a week before orientation to learn about a specific topic or area of interest. I ended up getting into an FPOP called 
         Social Innovation Exploration
      
 where we learned about different ways to address food insecurity in the Boston area and on campus which was a topic I felt tied perfectly with my interest in food accessibility.

- During the SIE FPOP, we got to take a trip to the Boston Haymarket where we learned about food in a local context and got to try some of the produce ourselves.

 

 

- During the week there were a lot of social activities that were also planned for us and one of my favorites was our trip to the Boston Fine Arts Museum.

- The crazy part is I almost decided to skip the museum trip entirely and just go back and chill in my dorm, but I got convinced to stay by my FPOPmates and I’m really glad that I did.

- The FPOP officially ended the Saturday of that week and our group had a small award ceremony on the Kendall Rooftop Garden to celebrate!

Part 3: REX, Rush, and Everything in Between

- The 
         REX 
      
 and Rush period, where every dorm, sorority, and fraternity tried to put on their best show to get freshmen to switch to their living community for a week, was where I saw some of the most unexpected things on a college campus? Sadly I missed out on some of the more thrilling activities that included paintballing, smashing up a car, jetskiing, boat rides, top golf, and escape rooms.

- And mixed in with all these activities were a lot of class-wide things that ranged from our group photo on Killian Court, to talks in Kresge, to the grand finale which included a huge migration by the MIT 2028 class to the New England Aquarium via 
         the T 
      
.

 

Part 4: School Actually Starts and the Rainbows and Sunshine Go Away…

- This one speaks for itself…

Part 5: Students and Sleep vs. Professors and PSETs

- I genuinely thought I would be ready for whatever MIT would throw at me and man was I wrong. But hey 
         P/NR am I right? 
      


Part 6: The Rainbows and Sunshine Return (kinda…)

- There are some days when the rainbows and sunshine return though and this usually happens when I get to do things with some of the different communities that I’ve found on campus. In particular, my SIE, 
         Design Plus 
      
, and 
         Chocolate City 
      
 communities have really helped me find my place here on campus and explore a lot of my interests outside of academics.

- And in the middle of studying for midterms, a bake-off competition with the Chocolate City and Juniper living communities became a well-needed and memorable break from academics…(spoiler alert my team won!)

- And most recently, I finally got to leave campus last week for class dinner with the freshmen and seniors in CC where I got to see some real views of Boston and try food that wasn’t from a dining hall.

Part 7: To be continued…?

- Can’t pretend to know what’s in store for me at this school anymore so stay tuned for more.

If I had a nickel for every class I was taking this semester…,Andi Q. '25,1,2024-10-12T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m a crusty senior now, so I have no fun and sparkly adventures to write about like the first-year bloggers have been doing (at least not for this week). However, what I do have as a senior is the freedom to choose fun elective classes without worrying much about prerequisites or fulfilling major requirements. I love talking about the classes I’m taking because they contribute so much to my enjoyment of MIT, so here’s what I’m taking this semester.

6.S965 (Digital Systems Laboratory II)

This class is the long-awaited sequel to 6.2050 (Digital Systems Laboratory I) – the intro FPGA class I took last fall. 6.S965 is all about revealing the inner workings of the black-box tools we took for granted in 6.2050. For example, much of our work in 6.2050 relied on hardware simulators that magically work; in 6.S965, we spent the first two weeks discussing how they work. We also learn about many techniques in modern digital hardware design that we weren’t smart enough for/didn’t have enough time to cover in 6.2050 – design verification, software-defined radio, and anything else that Joe Steinmeyer (the lecturer) thinks would be cool for us to experiment with. And just like 6.2050, there’s a big final project that I’m excited about, except now we get to use FPGAs that are more than 10x as powerful as the ones we used in 6.2050.

Surprisingly, most of the code we write in 6.S965 is in Python. Although Python may seem like a blasphemous choice for a hardware engineering class (where you’d typically see a low-level programming language like C or Assembly), it makes everything we do so much easier. A complicated testbench that would’ve taken me hours to set up using 6.2050’s infrastructure now takes me about twenty minutes using Python, with much more readable code to boot.

The special FPGAs we use that support Python are called “Pynq” boards. And yes, they are this shade of hot pink in real life.

The “S” in the subject number means that this class is a “special subject” (typically a limited-edition or experimental class about a new or niche research area); in this case, it’s the first time that Joe is offering 6.S965. It’s admittedly not the most polished class (yet); sometimes 
        things
      
 just don’t work even though Joe or 
        the official documentation
      
 said they would, but that’s the standard experience when working with hardware anyway. As a result, the class is much more open-ended and student-driven than other classes I’ve taken at MIT. It’s a lot like what I imagined/hoped MIT classes would be like before I applied.

Several of my friends are taking 6.S965 with me, and Joe is a great lecturer (who also brings home-grown cucumbers to lecturers sometimes). Overall, I’m having a great time in this class.

6.S951 (Modern Mathematical Statistics)

This class is my first statistics class at MIT! I’m still not entirely sure how “mathematical” statistics differs from regular statistics, but I think it’s all about formally proving/disproving statistical results typically presented as empirical facts. For example, if you’ve taken a statistics class before, you may have learned that 30 is the magic number of samples where the central limit theorem kicks in; however, that’s not always true, and we proved that in our latest problem set.

Even Google’s AI gets it wrong! However, I should note that for most real-world data, the magic number 30 does actually work.

6.S951 is by far my hardest class this semester. Many seemingly obvious results are surprisingly difficult to prove formally; sometimes, those “obvious” things aren’t even true at all. It’s extremely mind-bending, but wow is it satisfying when things finally click. I feel like I’ve learned more linear algebra in this class than in 18.06 (the actual linear algebra class), and I finally understand why the matrix trace operator is so important now.

Admittedly, taking 6.S951 as my first statistics class is probably 90% of why it feels so hard. Two of its prerequisite classes are 18.650 (Fundamentals of Statistics) and 18.100 (Real Analysis), and I’ve taken neither. So while the other students (most of whom are PhD students who research statistics) write up super elegant proofs like this:



I write up horrible monstrosities like this:

(It’s still just as correct as the elegant solution above though – I got full credit for this monstrosity.)

Definitely not my brightest idea in hindsight.

Despite the difficulty, taking this class was still a pretty good decision. I can keep up with the content because Professor Stephen Bates explains things well, and he thankfully doesn’t gloss over proofs or definitions he deems “trivial”. Plus, I’ve learned a lot, especially from thinking about analogies that make these unintuitive results make more sense. Aside from 6.S951 being my only class with exams this semester, I have no regrets about taking this class. I might even take the sibling class, 18.656 (Non-Asymptotic Mathematical Statistics) in the spring.

6.5940 (TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing)

This class is the coolest-sounding class I’m taking and the one I most looked forward to… but it turned out to be the most disappointing. Not that the content isn’t cool; quite the opposite – one of our assignments involves getting a large language model (like a smaller version of ChatGPT) to run 
        entirely on a laptop
      
. However, these assignments all boil down to filling in a few lines of code and pressing “run”, and I’d hoped that there’d be more to them than that. The lectures cover so many interesting topics (like custom computing architectures for deep learning), and I wish that more of them would make it into the assignments.

I suppose it isn’t necessarily bad that the assignments are like this though. Machine learning tools like PyTorch have become so good that we only need to write a few lines of code to build powerful machine-learning models. And the assignments would probably be far too complex if we had to implement everything covered in the lectures from scratch. (Imagine if the poor TAs had to help debug 200+ students’ homemade ChatGPT clones…)

Still, I’m enjoying the class because the content is fascinating. It’s a culmination of almost everything I’ve studied at MIT, from computer architecture to machine learning. I think there will even be some quantum mechanics in the final two weeks of the semester! There’s also a final project, which should hopefully be much more exciting than the assignments.

Also, Professor Song Han is possibly the most overpowered professor I’ve had so far at MIT. Almost every lecture is about some new technique that he and his group pioneered in hardware engineering or machine learning. The papers linked to these techniques would often have hundreds of citations too, and have won the best-paper award at whichever prestigious conference they first appeared in. Many of the charts we see in lectures end up being some variation on these two charts:



21M.587 (Fundamentals of Music Processing)

This class is one of the most fun classes I’ve taken at MIT. Not only is it a music class (already a strong indicator of being a great class), but it’s also a class about Fourier transforms, dynamic programming, and linear algebra! The class is taught by Professor Eran Egozy – creator of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, and veteran of the music technology industry. I especially love how he takes abstract algorithms and shows us how they were used to create technologies we use every day, like Shazam’s music recognition and Spotify’s song recommendations. It’s always cool to see real-world applications of things you learn in class; it’s even more cool when your professor is someone who created or worked on those applications.

Another great thing about 21M.587 is how interactive all the algorithms are. It makes understanding them so much easier when you can download an audio file, plug it into the code, and visualize how the algorithm processes the music. We do everything in Python, which makes it easy to implement all of this in just a few lines of code.

This class doesn’t cover 
        machine-learning approaches to music processing
      
 but instead focuses on more “fundamental” signal processing techniques. However, these techniques are still remarkably effective (and often outperform their machine-learning counterparts). For example, in our most recent problem set, I synced up two vastly different recordings of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata – one played on a grand piano and the other by the Eight Bit Big Bad – using these fundamental techniques.

A visualization of the synchronization using an algorithm called the “dynamic time warp”. I wish I could put a demo of the synchronized audio in this blog, but I don’t think WordPress would be happy about that.

21M.426 (MIT Wind Ensemble)

Last (but certainly not least), I’m in MITWE again! It still brings me as much joy as it did when I joined the ensemble in my freshman fall semester. That’s why I keep coming back, seven semesters and counting :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pynq-400x286.webp

climbing the wall,Veronica P. '27,1,2024-10-07T00:00:00-04:00,"There are a lot of phrases in the english language that can be used to describe me- “athletically inclined” is not one of them. I can appreciate and enjoy a sport, but never with a true passion that exceeds, say, a month at a time.

All this to say- when my friends invited me to go bouldering with them (think rock climbing but without a rope), I thought it would be a fun, one-time-only endeavor.

And the outing began pretty much as anticipated. I got some climbing shoes, chalked up my hands, acquainted myself with the wall, and attempted the beginner level- success!!

Ever the perfectionist, I resolved to complete every route for the base level (V0) before I could upgrade myself to the next one (V1). Only then could I prove my “worthiness.”

I soon, however, hit a roadblock: chipping away at the same routes again and again just to be met with the same pesky rocks I couldn’t quite reach, the same steps that left me resigning myself to the mat, unable to progress beyond the most rudimentary of levels. By then, I had convinced myself that my one, initial success didn’t “count”. The technique was all wrong, it was beginner’s luck.

After what felt like the millionth one of these attempts (more realistically- probably the eleventh), I wiped my hands and let my sigh- half exertion, half defeat- propel me back towards our station at the end of the mat, where my friend had been watching from a distance; I wasn’t the only one who was tired of my routine.

“It’s like you’re deciding you can’t climb these walls before you even attempt them.” 

Immediately, I knew she was right. Every movement I made- and didn’t make- was laced with doubt: I can’t reach that far, I don’t have the momentum to get there, I’m not strong enough, I’m going to slip, I’m going to fall, I’m going to lose my grip, I’m already losing my-

Often, we make decisions about the outcome well before it’s arrived: I’m going to bomb that interview. I’m going to fail this test. I’m not getting over this heartache. I’m not getting into that college. I’m just going to embarrass myself. I’m just wasting my time. 

Maybe we’re right. Maybe we’re wrong. Maybe we have reason to believe the things that we do. Maybe it’s best to manage expectations.

But when you know you’re going to attempt it regardless, there’s no point in psyching yourself out about the outcome. If you tell yourself you can’t climb that wall, you’re going to approach it as someone who can’t climb it. You’re going to discourage yourself from reaching for that next step. When you feel yourself start to slip, you’re going to let yourself fall, you’re not going to see the point in trying to recover it. You’re going to be right. 

So, I looked at my wall, and I told myself that I could climb it. Poetically enough, I did. Just for good measure, I climbed another. The next weekend, I biked back and climbed an even harder one.

(Whatever your wall is, you can climb it too. )",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2185-400x533.jpeg,1
Trail Notes,Sara N. '28,4,2024-10-06T00:00:00-04:00,"Summer in Alaska, I learned this July, is an exuberant, unrestrained triumph of nature. For just a few months, the landscape alters dramatically: the snow folds into itself & the green pushes out; fireweed lights valleys and mountaintops alike with a sharp, consuming pink and rivers grow heavy and silver with fish. The air is warmer, though not warm, and on brighter, bluer days, that perpetual mist wrapping around mountains dissipates slightly, its sheen broken through by sunlight. Despite never reaching the heavy heat of Kentucky summers, summer in Alaska feels more concentrated, more intense, though all of Alaska is like that – it demands full attention.

My summer at home, before and after Alaska, was mellow. Restful, if aimless. I re-read all the Newbery-winning books I loved in elementary school and worked my way through a beautiful collection of nature essays my neighbor gave me as a graduation present. I went on long morning walks and ate many large meals every day, and on most days, found time to nap on our staircase’s landing, one cheek pressed against the carpet, the other facing the sunlight.

Nearly twelve uninterrupted weeks of this, and then: MIT.

The month I’ve spent here thus far reminds me of the Alaska I saw in July. This school, too, feels extreme and intense and demands my full attention, something I fear I’m not always giving it. Some days, I stay up late enough to witness the sky begin to lighten, and I remember those equally persistent summer days in Alaska, where the sun would only begin to dip below the horizon near midnight and would be back up by 4. I walk through the Infinite Corridor and get that same giddy rush I felt in Alaska whenever my family would pull over into a scenic viewpoint, when we would get out and stand just the width of a road away from the base of a mountain and crane our heads upwards, our eyes tracing a pathway up until our line of sight would disappear into the skyline. Standing that close, I could never see the top. I remember that awe, that sense of disbelief, thinking just how incredible, how unlikely it is that I stand on the same ground as such giants, that both of us exert some force on this planet. It was – and MIT is – a rapid expansion of context, a humbling rescaling, this epiphanic realization that the world I am growing into is so much larger than anything I could have imagined.

The essay collection I started this summer and brought to MIT with me is called Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teaching of Plants and is written by Robin Wall Kimmerer. Kimmerer is a botanist and an author, and Braiding Sweetgrass is “an intertwining of science, spirit, and story.” It is a generous and warming collection, with each essay affirming the deep and time-honored relationship between humans and nature, but also serving as a reminder of the values that rest at the roots of the ecosystem we are all a part of: generosity, reciprocity, fundamental kindness towards ourselves and others.

One of my favorite ideas that I’ve come across in the collection is the rejection of the “recognized hierarchy of beings” common in the Western tradition, which places humans at the top and plants at the bottom. Instead, in indigenous knowledge, according to Kimmerer, humans are often referred to as “the younger brothers of Creation;” as one of the youngest species, we have much to learn from the world around us.

My friends and I joke that “there is no original experience,” but I truly believe this and think this goes even beyond the sort of universal experiences we have as a race; it also extends to other species, and I think it remains true on both the molecular and macroscopic level. I watched a biology lecture over the summer that explained that simple biotechnology problems – isolating certain molecules, cutting specific segments of DNA, etc. – faced in modern labs were solved by observing and adapting the behavior of primitive bacteria. This, I think, is the meaning of interconnectedness: every fundamental struggle, every ultimate question we face about the nature of things, has probably already been reckoned with by some species before us.

On our last day in Alaska, my family went on a guided three-mile hike within the Denali National Park and Preserve. It was easy and mild, more a nature walk than a hike. We were led by a wonderful ranger who pointed out all the little things we never even would have thought to look out for. I took notes: a running list of details, sentence fragments vaguely transcribing some of the stories our ranger told, and isolated scientific words and phrases I wanted to look into later.

What I saw that day:

1. The labrador tea plant, which is a small shrub with dark, shiny leaves with slightly fuzzy underneaths— Labrador tea leaves contain ledol, a toxin that causes cramps and paralysis, though when boiled, it is used to make herbal tea with medicinal properties. Our ranger said – and I have unfortunately not been able to corroborate this anywhere else on the Internet yet – that when boiled past a certain threshold, the labrador tea leaves once again become poisonous.

2. Many, many willow, birch, and dogwood trees, though the tallest were around three feet tall and the shortest were just a couple inches— Alpine dwarfism is a common adaptation within trees living in harsh arctic and subarctic environments; permafrost limits root growth and soil acidity limits nutrient availability, so for trees approaching the treeline, scaling down in size and growth is a fundamental requirement for survival.

3. Lichen, which grows like a copper-green crust upon rocks and trees— In one of her essays (“Umbilicaria: The Belly Button of the World”), Kimmerer writes that lichen “blur the definition of what it means to be an individual, as a lichen is not one being, but two: a fungus and and an alga.” The alga, being an autotroph, produces all the energy and the fungus collects minerals and maintains the moisture levels necessary for the alga to photosynthesize. Their symbiotic relationship is supported by a tightly intertwined architecture – fungal filaments wrap around and directly penetrate algal cells to deliver nutrients and siphon off sugar.

To study the lichen relationship, researchers attempted to recreate it in a lab setting. When conditions were ideal for both the fungus and the alga, they were surprised to see that nothing happened. Eventually, the experiments were neglected, and as a consequence, the resources within the petri dish started to diminish. It was only under this stressful environment that the fungus and the alga came together to become lichen.

4. A recently-deceased spruce tree with visible scarring from a beetle infestation— Spruce bark beetles are native to Alaskan forests, and have maintained a tensely balanced relationship with the forests they feed upon. In the summer, these beetles bore holes into the bark until they reach the phloem. Laying hundreds of eggs and releasing pheromones to invite others, the beetles push the tree to its capacity, gnawing through its phloem and cutting off its access to nutrients until the tree starves to death. Healthy trees have their own defense mechanisms – they are able to release bursts of sap that either flushes the beetles out or drowns them – so the victims of bark beetles are usually trees weakened either by age or disease.

This delicate, brutal balance has recently been disturbed by warming conditions. Summer now arrives earlier, and the beetles, dictated by simple biological instinct and nothing more, have now compressed their life cycles into half the original time. This means that summers now contain two attacks, and healthy trees weakened once by the first attack hardly have time to recover before the next.

Evidence of the beetle outbreak is obvious and unavoidable. As we drove across Alaska, we noticed huge swathes of forests discolored, the landscape stained with large masses of trees colored reddish-brown instead of the usual mint green. The dead trees stood like skeletal ghosts. Still standing, but in all ways that matter, gone.

“But it’s not their fault,” our ranger had said, regarding the spruce bark beetles and their changing biological cycles and the resulting massacre of trees. “They can’t help it.”

In a world where a simple existence of any kind is miraculous by definition, I sometimes wonder — what does it mean to be a human? We are, of course, one node in a vast, interconnected web, but there is also something that undeniably sets us apart.

There is an academic answer: a recent study found that the distinguishing feature of human intelligence is not our social reasoning or our ability to build and use tools, but is our ability to process and share vast amounts of information.

I think this is ultimately what makes us different from spruce bark beetles – we are ruled by more than just instinct.

Being human means we can read books and make art and learn from the world around us and become better people. The fact that we have greater agency and control over our actions and lives than most other species means that we are not only capable of change, but are designed for it. 

This past month, this has become a sort of affirmation for me. On days when I feel overwhelmed by the change from Kentucky to MIT, I try to imitate nature. From the labrador tea plant, I am learning that the search for balance is ultimately a function of trial and error, and that the inherent nature of life is that I’m bound to get things wrong before I get them right. I am learning from the alpine dwarf trees, who know there is no shame in bending down and starting small if it’s necessary for survival, and who know that anything worth doing at all is worth doing poorly at first. And I am learning from the lichen, who know that hard times call for immeasurable kindness and partnership. 

But being human means that I can also deviate if I choose to – unlike the lichen, I don’t necessarily want to discover the wonders of connection only when I’m at the precipice of catastrophe; I want to appreciate all that is around me, even while it is abundant. Especially while it’s abundant.

I am not always doing my best at all of these things, but I am trying, and I will get better.

One of my most fervent beliefs is that the most beautiful things in this world — gratitude, warmth, the kind of enthusiasm that gets you rambling — are abundant and overpowering, as long as we remember to intentionally and explicitly keep in touch with them.

Inevitably, there will be discomfort along the way. For me, coming to MIT is a little like a fishbowl being dumped into the ocean. It can be overwhelming and uncomfortable, but the discomfort is a symptom of growth, and is thus an ultimately positive process. The fish born in a fishbowl is inherently lucky to have ever even seen the ocean.

This is my goal for my college years: to be grateful when overwhelmed, and when comfortable, to be fueled by excitement rather than panic or urgency.

As one of my favorite bloggers wrote in 2012: “If I didn’t love the world and want to interact with it in a big way, I wouldn’t have come to MIT.” As the poet Jessica Abhugattas said in a poem I have loved recently (Eureka!), “Here in the heat / is where I need to be. This world is frightening; / I’m trying to enjoy it.” And as per one of my favorite lines from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein: “This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.”

If I ever require a little more inspiration, the world around me is evidence of the fruits of discomfort. Our Earth has faced six mass extinctions; I am facing college.

I think about the Alaskan land at the cusp of summer. Great, vibrant things await it, and it hardly knows. Spring is the season of softness, so the land must be at its most vulnerable before it is at its prime. I imagine that first thaw, those first roots breaking through the ice, the discomfort the land must grow round with before it tips towards transformation. And then— the fireweed, the sunshine, the blue, the green. The transitory awkwardness is forgotten, and exuberance becomes second nature. At its core, how can my experience be any different from the land’s? We’re both part of the same story.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-800x533.jpg

The Halls are Alive,Allison E. '27,1,2024-10-02T00:00:00-04:00,"Let’s face it, MIT’s campus is not known for being the most gorgeous of all college campuses. I personally like the mix of ultra-modern glass and steel, traditional marble, and cracked windows covered with peeling paint (it feels both exciting and homey!), but objectively speaking, campus is not beautiful.

The hallways inside these buildings can be even less aesthetically appealing–I think MIT has a vendetta against ceilings (if you look up, there’s always some array of pipes, wires, gratings above), and the walls are covered with an eclectic mishmash of posters. Again, it’s not beautiful. But I would argue that it’s something better: lived in. The hallways of MIT are alive.

From well before 9:00 am to well past 9:00 pm, the academic side of campus is filled with the tense energy of students shuffling between exams, and the awe of passing tourists, and the laughter of friends walking three-aside. But they’re also alive with various displays of creativity and mischief. These are some of my favorites from the past year:

Impromptu Concerts

There’s a piano sitting in one of the most trafficked thoroughfares on campus, just outside of 
        26-100
      
. People are constantly playing music on it (pop songs, classical pieces, etc.), but my favorite instance was a particular rendition of “All of Me,” by John Legend. I was sitting on a nearby couch, eating my lunch when it started out–just one person playing the piano. And then someone joined in singing, and then another, and another, with an audience growing in the hallway. Everyone disbanded as soon as the song ended, but it was awesome :D

The 26-100 piano!

Juggling in Lobby 10

Many a night I’ve returned from a 7:00 pm class or a late club meeting, and walking through 
        Lobby 10
      
 I find three or four people just… juggling! They’ve got colorful props, much whimsy, and seriously impressive skills. I think they do this pretty regularly, and it always makes me smile.

Lobby 10, albeit without jugglers :(

Free Listening

There’s this person who will occasionally sit on the steps of 
        Lobby 7
      
 with a sign that says “Free Listening.” I’ve never actually gone up to them before, but sometimes I’ll see someone else talking, and they’re just nodding along. Pretty cool.

Spot the Robot Dog 

MIT’s Stata Center is a building with… many quirks… Some are annoying, some are interesting, but one of the coolest is seeing an unnervingly life-like robot dog(?) occasionally roaming the halls. Meet Spot, the Boston Dynamics robot that jumpscared me while I was waiting for my next class to start! It looked completely unsupervised at first, as if it was just going for a casual stroll through the halls 😆

Spot spotted in Stata!

Free Polaroids

I was walking to class one day, and standing along the side of the hallway was someone with a polaroid camera. They called out, offering to take a free photo for me! Unfortunately I was a bit late, and couldn’t stop, but that was so wholesome.

Mysterious Boxes

This year, April Fool’s was the first day after spring break, and we returned to campus to find those yellow question mark boxes from Mario scattered all around the hallways. They were kind of everywhere, and were filled with various prizes? treasures? mysteries? inside! A few of the boxes I saw just had playing cards, but I also saw some more interesting items–a poll on PSet submission preferences, instructions on how to shower, and my personal favorite: unlabelled sheet music at the 26-100 piano that, upon sight reading in my head, turned out to be a 
        Rickroll
      
.

Conga Line !!!

Picture this: It’s the day of the MIT Science Olympiad Tournament, and hour 13(ish) of helping run the competition. There are fifty some-odd organizers packed into a room, trying to make sure that 16,000+ pages of exams have been fairly graded. It’s chaotic. Things are running behind schedule. We’re waiting frantically for more papers to come in. I leave to use the bathroom and for a blessed moment of quiet.

And then, as I’m walking back, I see thirty, maybe forty people forming a MASSIVE conga line down the middle of the hallway. To this day I have no idea who this group was (they weren’t tournament competitors) or 
        why they had gathered
      
. But I was dead tired, and screw it, this was really funny, so I joined the back of the conga line. In a couple yards, the hallway widened into the spacious Lobby 10, and two by two the line started forming a 
        human tunnel
      
. I was the last in the line, so they ushered me, cheering, through the center of the tunnel. The next-to-last person followed right behind me, until the entire tunnel had unraveled itself.

And then… everyone just dispersed? I don’t know where they went 😭. But anyways, I returned to checking over Science Olympiad tests with a bit more energy :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_1145-scaled-e1727927079929-1000x927.jpeg

[Guest Post] How to Build a Three Story Fort,Ceri R. '16,3,2024-10-01T00:00:00-04:00,"I’ve had all kinds of feelings about returning to MIT as staff a decade after I was a student here, but one of them is ✨delight✨ at seeing new generations of MIT students carry on traditions and make them their own. 

As admissions officers, we talk about one way the residents of East Campus exemplify our motto—mens et manus—with their yearly Build. The details of the project change each year, but it’s always ambitious, driven by passion, and a feat made possible by community. In fact, when I first got to the office, our information sessions even showcased a picture of the 2015 roller coaster (which I rode, and which some of my classmates helped build.) 

I’m really grateful that Zack I. ’27 offered to write up his experience as a project lead this year, giving you all a peek into this slice of MIT culture, creativity, and chaos. Everything below the line is his writing! 

My name is Zack and this year, I was one of the project leads for East Campus Build. Every year, 
        East Campus
      
 designs and builds a large-scale construction project to throw 
        a big party
      
 on it as part of 
        REX.
      
 In the past, we’ve built rollercoasters, a rotating climbing wall, forts, and more. This year, we built a three story fort with a bouldering wall and net suspended in the middle of the second floor :) 

CAD model of our fort.

We started work on the morning of August 9th with surveying and flagging out the footprint. Doing this accurately is relatively challenging, however. One of the other project leads had past experience lining soccer fields and introduced us to the method he learned back then. We took three lengths of string, two of which were cut to the side length of the overall footprint, while the third was cut to the hypotenuse length. When all of those strings were held end to end to form a triangle, we knew the two side lengths had to form a right angle between them. We then flipped the triangle to mark the other side of the fort’s rectangular footprint. 

This method is effective in theory, but again the physical implementation had a few main challenges. Our first issue was that the strings were slightly elastic, meaning once stretched the length was actually longer than what we measured it to be. We only have one measuring reel long enough, so for future years we’ll buy two more reels to form the triangle with them instead. Because our lengths weren’t perfectly accurate, our angle wasn’t perfectly 90 degrees. A small deviation from 90 degrees at the corner leads to wildly inaccurate measurements longer down the line, and it caused our overall footprint to slightly shift into a parallelogram. We did our best to combat this by holding up speed squares as a reference, but it was difficult to completely eliminate the parallelogram problem with the tools we had available to us. Once we had flagged out the positions within a margin of error we were comfortable with, we dug the holes and water-leveled the concrete blocks placed inside of them for the posts to sit on.

Footprint flagged featuring Santiago Y. ‘27 holding one end of the string.

And then we could start using the lumber! To begin, we constructed the ground frames and laid them on top of the blocks. This was where our first wood cut inaccuracies began to arise. 2x4s usually come in 96 inch lengths unless you specifically buy longer pieces. The side length of each rectangular fort unit is 
        96 inches
      
 and people assumed that all of the 2x4s could just be taken and used for assembly straight out of the pallet. In reality, while most 2x4s were accurately cut, a sizable percentage were 96.25” or 95.75” or some permutation of mildly incorrect that went unnoticed until the piece was measured. When all of our ground frames were assembled and placed onto the blocks we found that the overall width and length of the fort were something like an inch or so off each. We should have taken the ground frames apart and recut the lengths that were slightly off to ensure everything was completely the correct dimension, but at the time 
        we decided it was within our margin of error and chose to proceed with starting work on the second floor.
      


First, a little background about what exactly we needed to do to get a second floor unit in place. In recent memory, East Campus forts have been constructed from rectangular platforms we call fort units. They are supported by four 4×4 posts at each corner, and the posts are connected by girders bounding the sides of the top rectangle. Down the middle, perpendicular to two of the girders, we attach the center spine that splits the unit into two equal halves. The two girders parallel to the center spine are connected to it via 9 joists spanning horizontally across each half. After the joists are in place, we screw 3/4” plywood over the top as flooring and that forms the basic fort unit structure.



Beginning an upper floor means posts. Post raising is always the primary bottleneck with build because it requires a lot of hands to get the 
        massive
      
 4×4 post raised vertically, level on all axes, hammered flush with the ground frame, and screwed into place. We had to structure our priority schedule around post raising taking place during the times when the most people were onsite. This meant the mornings and afternoons were usually spent measuring and cutting wood to the correct length in preparation and the evenings were dedicated to getting as many posts up as possible. Another thing we changed this year was the length of the posts we would raise. In the past we raised three story posts in one piece from the ground and they required a lot of manpower. This year, we chose to keep some parts of the posts in components and raise them to just their second story heights at first. Then, once the second floor was complete, we would raise the top half of the posts and attach them to the components below. This made it possible to make substantial progress with fewer people. 

The first three units in progress.

We decided to reverse the classic East Campus tradition of procrastinating the 
        stairs
      
 until the last day and finish them very early on. Marlow T. ‘27, one of the other project leads, had taken point on the stairs during the design process, so she primarily led their construction. The main concern she wanted to focus on with the stairs design was to ensure we didn’t have to manually cut the side profile for each step into the 
        stringers.
      
 The stringers are made from 
        long
      
 2×12 pieces and we don’t use that type of wood for anything else so we buy very few of them. It’s difficult to cut the side profile accurately without weakening the wood. To avoid having to go through that time-consuming and difficult process for 2 out of the 3 stringers, we screwed 2×4 scrap into the side of the stringers at the correct height and angle so that the step ends could be supported on top of them. Stairs have a lot of small and intricate cuts that make them very time-consuming, so we set aside an entire weekend in our schedule to focus on their construction. This proved to be a great decision because having functional stairs that early on drastically improved our mobility while constructing the second and third floor.

After we finished the stairs, we returned to the main fort structure. It took about a week to get the components of the second floor frames up, and finishing that roughly corresponded with the first night prefrosh were here for FPOPs. One night, 
        Paola R. ‘27
      
 brought 20 prefrosh in one big group who all wanted to help build. We didn’t have enough tools for all of them at once, but we were able to set up an assembly line with half of them carrying the plywood sheets up to the second floor and the other half actually screwing the sheets in. I expected plywood flooring to take about a day to finish, but Paola’s army decimated the task in like two hours.

Second floor complete!

Third floor in progress (feat. our extremely helpful screw sponsor Simpson Strongties)

It may seem like it, but build isn’t entirely run by project leads and upperclassmen. Build is specifically designed to be beginner-friendly and an opportunity to learn basic construction skills and tool use, so freshman participation is encouraged. After the freshmen moved in for orientation week, we had them installing crossbracings to fortify the structure. There are two crossbracings in each corner of every unit, which meant this build required over a hundred total. Another task we used large groups of prefrosh to do efficiently was building and installing the railings. We built two jigs on the ground that made it easy to slot all of the appropriate pieces into place and simply screw everything together all at once. This allowed groups of prefrosh to mass manufacture railings on the ground before installing them on upper floors. With both the railings and crossbracings, we were able to parallelize multiple groups of prefrosh working at the same time to get those tasks done faster.

Enough of the overall frame in place meant we could start focusing on some of the more specific features of this year’s fort. We had our art leads Rory K. ‘25 and Jayna E. ‘27 paint the mural panels for this year on the ground and we raised the boards into place once they were done. The boards between the first and second floor were thick enough to be used as a bouldering wall, and the routesetters used the afternoon before the Eastside Party to mark and bolt in the wall’s holds. 

While some of the smaller elements of the fort’s structure were being finalized, I embarked on a sidequest to rig up the net in the center. It took me about 5 hours to rig the net, which was far longer than I thought it would be lol. I wove a continuous strand of webbing through the edges of the net and the u-bolts installed into the fort’s frame and tied the webbing into a closed loop with a tensioning hitch. Because the net was brand new, though I tensioned it tightly as I put it up, after a hundred people sat in it over the course of a week it sagged a lot more than I intended. Hopefully if this net is used for future forts that stretch will be accounted for already and it’ll better maintain its tension over the course of the week.

The final step for the fort’s visual appearance on the day of the party is for the lighting team to put up the projects they have been working on over the course of the spring and summer. While lighting and general themed decorations went up, the DJ equipment was set up on the third floor. Eventually, we opened the fort up for the Eastside Party and everything was all perfect and amazing for 
        the entirety of REX.
      


Finished fort right before the party :o

P.S. Every year we also have 
        small builds
      
 that are designed and carried out by separate small build leads. This year we had a treehouse with a dome on top of it designed by Jordan T. ‘25 and Hanu S. ‘26, a space trainer ride built by George J. ‘27 and Pablo H. ‘27, and 
        a substance wrestling pit
      
 led by Gage L. ‘26.

The treehouse topped with a geodesic dome.

a lesson in the feminine arts,Aiden H. '28,4,2024-09-30T00:00:00-04:00,"Last year when deciding which colleges I wanted to apply to, I had one priority over all else: living on a coast. I’m sorry all states from Utah to Virginia, but there was no way I could go four years without at least an ocean to walk to and ponder my melodramatic nature over.

And while MIT fit the criteria of being a) on a coast and 
        b) VERY close to a body of water
      
, the only things I knew about Boston before moving here were about the Celtics, the Boston Tea Party, and the accent. Growing up, I just had no preconceptions of what Boston was like how L.A. and New York have such distinguished vibes.

This is a tragedy. Having been here for only 38 days, I can confidently rank Boston higher on my list than other cities I’ve been to and have been eager to get off campus and actually go explore the city I live in. One of my first ~outings~ was when I took a
        blue bike
      
 down to Northeastern’s campus alone one Sunday to explore the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (MFA Boston). I found a museum-themed Spotify playlist and began to walk around alone to the soft pattering of classical music, and loved it!

So in an effort to encourage you to go around Boston (or just outside generally), here are my highlights from my trip and all the things it made me feel.

DALI: DISRUPTION AND EVOLUTION

Apparatus and Hand – Salvador Dali (1927)

The museum has a huge Dali exhibit right now until December 1, and even though I only got a photo of one painting, this was intentional to spark your curiosity about what could be. Just like with Dali and surrealism in general, I feel like the off-putting nature and seemingly no answers kinda pulls you in?

To combat this lack-of-answers in Dali’s content (at least, at first glances), the exhibit does a really good job of pacing the paintings and providing descriptions of how his life and the surrealist movement are shown in the works, helping to piece together whatever it means.

The exhibit ends with a quote that I felt like accurately represented the whole experience: “My audience mustn’t know whether I am spoofing or being serious; and likewise I mustn’t know either. Where does the deep and philosophically valid Dali being, and where does the bizarre and preposterous Dali end?” This kinda duality of man has been a constant throughout art history, but I feel like recently it has resurged into our young minds (albeit, in a slightly meme-ier way). Am I cottage core or dark academia? Should I cosplay as Brat or an Ultraviolence-era Lana Del Rey sad girl today? Am I secretly a gym bro? If I am a gym bro, when am I an academic gym bro compared to the stereotypical dumb guy? Can I write a blog post about serious art while making a stupid meta joke about the art itself? More importantly, how can my inherent stupidness and seriousness coexist in a way that doesn’t diminish the other?

 

MONET

Monet is my favorite painter of all time (I would decorate my entire house with just him if it wasn’t tacky), so it was unsurprising that I went into the Monet room for too long and just stared. My favorite part is that it is just…pretty? It’s not didactic, it’s not “intellectual”, there’s nothing to do except appreciate it for how good it looks.

I haven’t seen 
        these editions of the Rouen Cathedrals before
      
, so it was cool to check more off my list.

Nothing crazy, just my pretty favs.

 

ART OF ANCIENT EGYPT, NUBIA, AND THE NEAR EAST

This is the only photo I got and the tag wasn’t in frame, so I’m sorry to say it and I hope I don’t sound ridiculous, but I don’t not know this man, I am sorry to this man, etc.

This section of the museum has a lot of mummies/graves/caskets/tombs scattered throughout. I don’t include any photos here to a) encourage you further to go see them, and b) because I find it weird to take photos of a piece that is meant to represent the life and legacy of an actual living person. Walking through this part of the museum gave me the same overwhelming feeling of walking through a cemetery. It’s easy to walk past each piece and notice how wow! they look exactly like we were taught in elementary school!, but it can be both extremely emotional and important to walk through and understand the weight of the art around you and how it is meant to represent the lives of entire people we’ll never get to know through anything except these (essentially) decorative rocks. 

10/10

Over the years, my friends and I have developed a running joke about the importance of the “feminine arts”. With the meteoric rise of Pride and Prejudice (2005), Bridgerton, cottage core, and everything of the like into Gen-Z’s minds, we’ve romanticized what was the almost-definitely-awful lifestyle of the 1800s British. Why worry about Instagram or your finances when you could
        speak French and have tea outside in white linen clothes?
      


My Sunday at MFABoston definitely fulfilled the museum-aesthetic that I have been vying for. But while these leisures of “high society” can be fun to gawk over with others, everything mildly fancy feels like a competition. I simultaneously must prove my taste is high-class while disproving yours. We commodify art as a means to prove our worth to others, when really we are just organs with opinions who didn’t make the art in the first place. With such a vast extent of art and culture to be “known” at the museum, even writing this blog post is a daunting exercise in how to talk about and describe art in a way that is purposeful but not esoteric.

This is why I think being in the museum environment, or really anywhere in public alone, can be a really vital experience. And, shockingly, being alone in a museum isn’t difficult! (gasp!) I feel like there’s not much to say past “I like this one” or “what is that?” or “aiden stop trying to touch stuff or we’re gonna get kicked out”. Whether it stems from this internal idea that museums are elegant and you must be an intellectual to enjoy true art or just the societal pressure to make small talk in quiet rooms, the conversation is distracting from the actual purpose you could extract from walking around alone. Turns out, art is a lot harder-hitting when you’re forced to just sit there and think about it. 

So go sit there alone and think about it.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-2139754229-e1727737579168-400x518.jpg

this ain’t (not) Texas,Kanokwan T. '26,2,2024-09-29T00:00:00-04:00,"I step off my plane, and immediately spot this amusing sign adorned with cowboy hats:

 

I step outside and breathe in the toasty evening air. Hot like Vegas (where I flew in from), but much more humid.

I get to the parking garage, and my rental car agent greets me with a “Howdy, how can I help?” I meekly smile at the word usage, and answer his question.

 

These little things reminded that I was, indeed, in a new place: Austin, Texas.

Texas is not what I had expected it to be.

- The state is not just sand and cacti. Yes, Texas has ample desert landscape, but the irony is most people live in the watery areas. Austin is lush green. I found this extra ironic because I’m from Las Vegas, which is super desert-y.

- You do need a car to get around, but some areas are super walkable. My neighborhood and downtown were both easy on foot.

- The state is politically diverse. To be fair, I lived in the notoriously hippie-leaning city of Austin, but still. Though the state leans right, there’s much under the cover. Similar to California, which leans left, Texas has a strong presence of different political views across the board.

I spent this past summer working as a Product Design Engineering Intern at Apple. My job felt meta: working on MacBooks by working on MacBooks. I loved the (almost) annoying extent to which people focused on details. The company cares about every little thing, leaving no stone unturned.

Have you ever wondered how these products are really made? How do products go from idea to mass production? How are design decisions made? I have.

Here’s the 
        answer:
      
 people, lots of them. I can’t unsee the work behind these products. There’s a bajillion people for every nibbly little step. This job made me have a deeper appreciation for not just Apple products, but all products. With modern-day globalization, it can be hard to remember that every product we use is ultimately made by humans.

I learned a lot, and I even got a chance to fly out to the headquarters in Cupertino, CA to engage with the rest of our team and do my final presentation. My god. I’ve never seen slide decks be any more elegant in my entire life. Consequently, the slides I put together were the best I had ever made.

All in all, everything—products, buildings, machines—was beautiful.

Outside of work, I spent a lot of time getting acquainted with the local culture. Austin is awesome at three main things: water activities, food, and live music.

- There’s SO much water! Austin is a green city. You can go swim in natural springs, attend boat parties on lakes, and tube down rivers. Barton Springs Creek is one of the jewels of this city.

- Fooooooood. I feel that most places can claim some sense of pride in their food, but Austin really does. The food scene is so intense that locals have made their own app to pay for someone else to wait in food lines for you. I probably should’ve used it—my friend and I waited 2 hours for some Texan BBQ at a joint called Interstellar. It was so worth it, though: easily the best meal I had my entire summer. Austin is cosmopolitan, so there’s an international array of cuisine outside Texan food, too.

- Austin is nicknamed the “live music capital of the world.” As a concert junkie, I was very excited to attend shows here. I most frequented a bar named The Elephant Room, which had excellent jazz.

I’ve come to love Austin. It’s lively, yet also full of quiet nooks. It’s geographically central in the US, so friends from both the west and the east were able to easily visit. The city prides in locally-owned shops, which is where the phrase “Keep Austin Weird” comes from. It’s family-oriented, so I always felt safe.

Especially because this was my first time living fully alone, peace of mind is something I valued. I’ve never seen more dogs and babies in one place. My neighbors were sweet: they always greeted me when I returned home from work and even invited me to play dominos and swim at our apartment complex pool. Austin’s neat.

Here are some moments I had:

Texan things

art & nature

FOOD

sidequests

This summer was fundamentally different from last summer. I interned at a domestic big company whereas last summer, I interned at an international startup.

You can also think of my summers as nodes: points in which vectors flow in and out.

Last summer, I felt like a source node. Whilst living in the UK, I found myself traveling to a different country every other weekend. This summer, I felt like a sink node. I mostly stayed in Austin, and I was surprised to find that many friends wanted to visit me. A different friend flew in around every other weekend.



I’m grateful to have had both experiences: to have seen different places through my same two eyes (NW Europe), and also to experience the same place through the different eyes of my friends (Austin).

turning back time,Ellie F. '28,3,2024-09-27T00:00:00-04:00,"I spent this past 
        summer
      
 at Canada/USA Mathcamp, where I lived five weeks in Tacoma, Washington doing some math and a lot of camp. Mickey Mouse™ won’t tell you this, but Mathcamp actually beats Disney as the most magical place on Earth.

With a name like Mathcamp, you’d assume we do a lot of math. And you’re not wrong. But everyone can choose exactly how much and what type of math they do, and as a serious and dignified mathematician myself, I’ve learned to solve quadratics with origami, use the Axiom of Choice to win 
        infinite games against evil kings
      
, make mathy sculptures and embroidery, and become a master at advanced chickenology.

But we do a lot more than just math (gasp!). Let me tell you a story.

1. A story

One normal day, after my second class, I was very hungry and walking to the cafeteria. Suddenly, I was struck by divine inspiration, as does often happen when I am hungry and near cafeterias. Don’t believe me? I have proof.

On this day, I was wondering why clocks go the wrong way. I mean, any real mathematician knows that counterclockwise is the positive direction, right? I immediately decided it was too difficult a task to actually reverse the clock, but I did have another brilliant plan. I’ve outlined it in this image:

violence → ??? → profit!

2. they did surgery on a clock

The actual product was much cleaner. After we journeyed 40 minutes (and broke and superglued one shoe) to buy the clock from 
        Walmart
      
, we decided to disassemble it and get our hands on the clock’s internal organs with all the confidence of an improv artist pretending to be a surgeon.

Turns out, the clock has a permanent magnet that, when reversed, makes it perfectly counterclockwise. Rejoice! The next day, I created a custom face for the clock, one that started with 0 on the x-axis and went in the counterclockwise direction. We hung it up in the main lounge for the world to see, and a few days later, our work caught the notice of Eric, one of the camp directors. He proposed to us a business venture.

3. ⚠️TRADE OFFER ⚠️

Every year, Mathcampers can order shirts, and some years, money may also be exchanged for other goods and services, such as frisbees or bucket hats. What if this year, we sold special Mathcamp 2024 Counterclocks? We jumped at the offer, even though it would cost dearly in our own labor. To advertise our product, we wrote a live infomercial to present in front of the entire camp.

In all, over 120 clocks were ordered. In fact, demand was so high that we bought out the entire supply of red clocks from the nearest Walmart, prompting the Counterclock Cabal to have no choice but to ransack all the other Walmarts nearby. But just buying the clocks was the easiest part. 

4. The children YEARN for the mines clock factory

Now, we actually had to make the clock. We sent out a call for help by posting on the 
        schedule board
      
, and when it was time, a dozen Mathcampers descended upon the crafts lounge like vultures hungry for unpaid labor.

the job listing

We started by cutting out 8-inch diameter custom clock faces and cardstock. By the time we were done, we had piles and piles of hand-cut confetti. Then came the reversing itself. Eric had optimized every step of the process, down to the last screw. We even created a playlist featuring songs like “I’ve Had the Time of my Life,” “Time after Time,” and “Rock Around the Clock.” The first session ended up reversing 82 clocks, and after the second session, we had boxes and boxes filled with 128 certified Mathcamp Counterclocks.

5. I am a Serious and Dignified mathematician

I was blown away by the support and enthusiasm for the counterclocks, that a stupid idea I had one day could become actual, paid-for items in dozens and dozens of households. This is what I love about Mathcamp—any silly, strange, or otherwise unrealistic idea or event or project is not only allowed but actively encouraged and loved. That’s what let us enforce curfew on staff with Nerf guns and alarm the rest of campus by descending upon the dining hall like a flamboyance of flamingos. That’s why we made liquid nitrogen ice cream every week and went star tripping, staring at the sky and spinning until we fell down onto the wet grass. That’s how I got a fifth of Mathcamp to dress up as wizards and ended up running through Seattle trying to go to as many Starbucks as I could in 30 minutes. 

Mathcamp’s spirit makes me want to dream more, and to actually do and create the things I dream about. My Counterclock now ticks away in my dorm room, sitting with the Kermit puppet I made and performed with at Mathcamp cabaret, and the Boeing 787 model I bought at the Boeing factory field trip. Maybe it can’t actually reverse time and take me back to last summer, but it reminds me that this magic exists independently of camp, and that it’s something that I can seek out and create and grow here at MIT.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/straws-thingy-800x928.jpg

I Don’t Know,Emiko P. '25,6,2024-09-27T00:00:00-04:00,"I don’t know where I’m going to be a year from now.

That’s never really happened to me before. Preschool through college, it was kind of obvious that, duh, I’d be going to school next year. Maybe the only other time that would be comparable to what I’m feeling now would be when I was a senior in high school trying to figure out which college I would be going to. But still – at least I knew I’d be going to school somewhere.

As an undergrad senior who isn’t applying to grad school (yet) and has no concrete future plans hammered down, this feels different. The 
        pretty much linear direction of my life
      
has kind of exploded into a thousand different directions. Usually, I can think one year into the future, and there’s a fuzzy semblance of what my life will look like. 

Yet, right now as I sit and type this, I look a year into the future, and it’s a crystalline, pure nothing. Or maybe – better put – it’s a crystalline, pure anything.

A year from now, I could be:

- A mission operations engineer in Tokyo, flying a lunar lander to the moon.

- An English teacher back in Missouri, sharing my love of reading, creative writing, and mentoring with a bunch of high school students.

- A journalist for National Geographic, sailing along the coast of South Africa and witnessing the migration of dolphins, sharks, and whales.

- A sci-fi novelist, tucked away in a cabin somewhere in Michigan, where my days are filled with quiet days on a lake, inter-planetary battles, and cosmic magic.

- Part of the team trying to send humans back to the moon at NASA, imagining what the moon as the 8th continent of Earth would look like.

- Part of a community nonprofit, working to help energize and restore my home city of St. Louis.

- A world traveler, jumping from continent to continent with all my possessions fitting in a hiking backpack.

- A consultant in New York City, knowing the public transportation system like the back of my hand and rocking a blazer.

The possibilities are endless, and what’s truly crazy is that any of these alternate realities really could be me in a year. And as I continue this whole process of thinking about life post-grad, it’s unexpectedly led to a lot of internal reflection. 

I got lunch with a high school friend recently back in St. Louis, and she asked me something that really stuck with me: “Emi, if you stripped away every external expectation – your family, money, society, your sense of obligation – what would you be left with?” 

Without the expectation of earning a gargantuan amount of money, maintaining a stable and healthy work life balance, snagging a cool job to impress everyone – who am I, and what do I want? It only took a few moments of thinking about this before I felt an intense sort of clarity. 

I want to read books, creatively write, explore outer space, nurture the next generation, solve, create, imagine… Something in my body literally feels lighter when I dream of these things – as if a part of my soul has become sparkling and buoyant. I want to find that feeling on whatever of the one thousand roads ahead I take.

Something interesting that I’ve noticed is that I often write in other blogs about things that have already happened – classes and internships and soccer games – where everything has been tied up in a nice bow. Well, this blog is different. This is my official statement saying that I do not know yet.

I’m optimistic about this uncertainty, though, because with big changes and leaps of faith come unexpected and precious rewards. MIT is a perfect example. The night before my parents were going to move me in my freshman year, I sat on the brick steps of a restaurant on Newbury Street in Boston and loudly cried and sniveled for what felt like 30 minutes, because “I don’t know anyone here! I just want to go home.” Now, three years later, a part of me can’t bear to leave. 

It’s so funny how that works – when something you fear turns into something you can’t imagine you ever lived without. I’m kind of writing this as a reminder to myself and any others out there that even though the future is scary, once we venture into the unknown, what we find there may not be so scary after all.

This all being said, one year is a long time from now. For now, with two more semesters left, I’m looking forward to learning as much as I can about everything from satellites to Japanese literature to product design; having fun playing a sport where we kick an inflated synthetic leather ball around a field for 90 minutes; 
        promising my roommates we will go to sleep early;
      
 and trying to set a record with my friends for most soup dumplings consumed at Dumpling House ever!",,0
"In the Music Cubes, no one can hear you scream…",Andi Q. '25,1,2024-09-25T00:00:00-04:00,"… which just goes to show what a great job the acoustics engineers did on soundproofing the building! I got to experience it first-hand last week, and it was pretty mindblowing.

That’s right – the Music Cubes (
        otherwise
      
 known as Building W18 or the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building) are finally open! For those of you unfamiliar with the Music Cubes, they consist of three cube-shaped buildings arranged at odd angles between 
        Kresge Auditorium
      
 and 
        the sports fields
      
, and form MIT’s new music hub. They’ve been under construction since I started at MIT, and I’d often wonder what secrets those mysterious 90%-windowless cubes would hold. (Perhaps a prison for music students who played one too many wrong notes during a rehearsal? Or maybe they’re giant versions of Minecraft note blocks?) Like much of MIT’s brutalist architecture, the exterior doesn’t exactly scream “art is created inside this space,” but after three long years, I can confirm that art is indeed created inside the Music Cubes.

The Music & Culture Space is the smallest cube and the one I know the least about. As far as I can tell, it’s just one massive room that takes up the entire building. That room currently serves as the rehearsal space for Rambax (MIT’s Senegalese drum ensemble) and Galak Tika (MIT’s Balinese gamelan ensemble); I think it’ll also become a dance studio soon.

Rambax and Galak Tika used to rehearse in Building N52 – a 10-minute walk off campus. Now they have a space right in the center of campus.

The room is apparently also a small performance space (Galak Tika already has a concert scheduled there). Though I’m not entirely sure how that would work because there are no chairs inside, and you must remove your shoes before entering.

The Music Maker Building is the tallest cube and houses rehearsal rooms, offices, recording studios, a classroom, and even a makerspace! As such, it is also the only cube with windows. (Although the placement of those windows leaves much to be desired.)

This is how my Sims 3 houses used to look when I was twelve.

However, I think there’s a practical reason why there are so few windows – they’re just much harder to soundproof than solid walls, especially when even the solid walls require more than a foot of insulating material. As a result of this design choice, the soundproofing inside the Music Maker Building’s rehearsal rooms is insanely good. You really should go inside and experience it yourself to hear just how good it is, but to give you an idea, two musicians can play in adjacent rehearsal rooms and not hear each other at all. (Even with the door open, the sound you can hear in the hallway is quite muffled.)

But that’s not all these rehearsal rooms have to offer! Each one also has an array of microphones built in, which allow us to make high-quality studio recordings at the click of a button without worrying about setting up all the equipment.

Anyway, this building’s theme is music technology (hence the high-tech rehearsal rooms). The makerspace is equipped with electronics for tinkering with digital musical instruments, and FaMLE (MIT’s laptop ensemble) sometimes rehearses here.

Finally, the Performance Lab is the crown jewel of the Music Cubes – a brand-new concert hall modeled after the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin. Although it is not as big as Kresge (which seats almost twice as many people), it’s better suited for smaller ensembles, especially with its unusual layout where the audience completely surrounds the performers.

The Performance Lab is still under construction and will only open near the end of the semester, but it will be just in time for the MIT Wind Ensemble’s last rehearsal before winter break!

On a tangentially related note, the MIT Wind Ensemble is having an “open rehearsal” next Monday 9/30! If you’re an MIT student who wants to learn more about music performance at MIT (
        and also preferably plays the bassoon
      
), come to Kresge at 8:15-ish to sit in the audience, on stage with us, or even play along!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/music-cubes-800x600.png

必须好 – pt. 1,Jessica Z. '27,1,2024-09-23T00:00:00-04:00,"additional context: hello! the writing below was my first ever attempt at blogging—funnily enough, i only started this writing to apply to be a blogger. while i read it now and see 
        many things i would change,
      
i think i generally did an okay job representing my feelings, and i’d like to keep it in a more authentic state (even if i cringe reading it now). 

i remembered this draft’s existence when i found myself writing a similar-ish blog last week. i thought it’d be interesting to post this now—nearly one year later—and post a part 2 later reflecting on how MIT has both changed and not changed my perspective.

I am an angry crier. In high school, I stared blankly at a wall whenever I was hit with a wave of sadness. But when I felt a bubbling feeling of frustration build in my chest, I knew that a rush of tears would soon follow. 

I went through a rush of angry tears last Friday. 

 

Rising Waters

I spent Friday morning and early afternoon helping my friends move into their new apartment. I drove home at 3:03pm and made a mental plan of everything I wanted to do for the rest of the day in the spirit of productivity. If you know me personally, I am a notes app lover; I spent the next few minutes typing out a personal schedule for myself and started working on my first task. 

Roughly forty minutes later, my phone exploded with an onslaught of notifications from my parents alerting me that the restaurant was busy. For some background, my parents immigrated to America and opened a small Chinese restaurant back in 2003. There’s a
        deep history to Americanized Chinese food,
      
but in short, it’s a common business practice for Chinese immigrants to open small restaurants in America. In an all-too-familiar rhythm, I threw on my working clothes, chucked on my shoes, and went downstairs into the restaurant. 

Working in the restaurant isn’t light work. It’s surprisingly physically demanding, and it’s not exactly glamorous sprinting back and forth between the kitchen and dining area. I walked back upstairs roughly six hours later at 10:23pm. 

Entering my room, I took a look at my planned schedule, the unchecked boxes on my to-do list, and the stationary scattered on my desk from my unfinished first task. I felt my body tense, and my nose began to twinge with heat. A bubbling pit of frustration in my chest began to build, and soon enough, the tears started to fall. 

 

Going Under

My relationship with the restaurant is complicated. It’s my family, my culture, my identity, and admitting I harbor any feelings of resentment towards it makes me feel like I’m giving up on all those core aspects of my life. At the same time, however, it’s undeniable how much time it takes away from my life compared to other students.

For as long as I can remember, one of my deepest insecurities has been falling behind academically. Part of this is rooted in imposter syndrome, but it’s also rooted in knowing the long hours I spend in the restaurant are hours that I could have spent developing technical skills that would make me feel more confident entering college. It was easy to feel more “ahead” in middle school simply because I didn’t understand the vastness of the world, but my fear deepened as I grew older. Once the initial euphoria of getting into college wore off, my sinking fear of being unable to catch up returned. No, I didn’t take AP Calculus at 14, publish a paper at 15, patent a product at 16, present at a conference at 17…the list goes on. I always wonder what I could have become with more free time. I worry that, because of my family responsibilities, I missed a critical time in my youth where I could have molded myself to understand more, learn more, be more. 

I know that this is an unfair mindset and not entirely true. I’ve done meaningful work throughout high school that I’m proud of, including being able to support my parents. But it’s hard to tell myself that when I see people my age or younger
        completing internships at well-known companies or conducting professional research in laboratories.
      


It’s also not to say I don’t appreciate the restaurant or my parents—they’re the reason I have the opportunities I do today. It doesn’t escape me that I’ve been given an opportunity my parents were never afforded—I’m incredibly lucky. But it’s on days like today where I feel an unmistakable sense of jealousy for other people who don’t constantly have to be on standby. Who don’t have to put their priorities on the backburner for sudden schedule changes. Who don’t have to finish their homework between long phone calls and bustling customers. 

When I think about it for too long, the ache in my chest deepens, and it feels like I am choking. I become a worse version of myself: envious, spiteful, childish. 

 

Catching my Breath

I was able to think more clearly after about a half an hour of angry tears. I’m a bit embarrassed to admit how upset I was, but I think crying it out is sometimes necessary. Even after years of working chaotically in the restaurant and experiencing similar emotions, I haven’t found a fool-proof way to combat them. However, I have practiced some healthy ways to cope with these unpleasant feelings and ground myself from spiraling. 

One of those ways is to remember how the restaurant has helped me, even if unconventionally. When I become upset, I childishly tell myself that the time I lost to the restaurant is wasted time. But, I know that this isn’t true. It’s not the time I planned to spend, but it’s certainly not time that I wasted doing nothing. 

While preparing food every day doesn’t initially seem academically beneficial, it’s true that it’s taught me the importance of consistent work. The same way that speaking to disgruntled customers makes me want to scream, but it has also taught me the value of communication and conflict resolution. Instead of feeling annoyed at being suddenly called to work, I tell myself I am learning to be adaptable. Yes, sometimes I feel like I’m drowning and can’t catch my breath, but eventually, those feelings begin to fade.

 

Learning to Swim

When I think about my earlier angry tears, I can’t tell where my anger is directed. I’m not angry at the restaurant. I’m not angry at my parents. I’m not angry at myself. Maybe there’s a thinly blurred line between anger and general frustration. Or maybe I’m more upset that I have no one to blame. 

There’s a Chinese phrase, 必须好 (bìxū hǎo), that directly translates to “must be good.” In lieu of accurate direct Chinese-to-English translation, the saying basically means that life moves on because it has to move on.

The boxes on my to-do list are unchecked, but they will get done simply because they have to get done. And not having everything done today won’t create a setback so strong that I’m unable to catch up. It’s not that I’m not trying—it’s that life simply gets in the way sometimes, and that doesn’t necessarily mean that my time spent on another task is automatically useless because it’s not what I originally planned. 

The next four years at MIT are going to be filled with a much larger and diverse community than I know now. There will be people who are, objectively, ahead of me academically—I’ve never coded more than ten lines in Python, presented at a major conference, or taken an engineering class, even as a prospective engineering major. I fear being the only person in a PSET study group that just doesn’t understand. My fear of falling behind and not understanding is simply something I will have to get used to because it will happen in college. At the same time, though, I have to keep reminding myself I have other skills I can bring, and I’m at college to learn.  

In other words, you just have to keep swimming.",,0

I primarily use my iPad, SLP-F9FD20PWLMX0 to take notes during class. SLP is a tough, no nonsense master of productivity, with a work ethic I admire greatly. Offering me free academic tools and nothing more, SLP protested greatly when my friend tried to download Genshin Impact on them, and when I used their Apple Pencil to draw the Among Us version of Massachusetts.

Behold… MassachuSUS!!!!

Deep down, I think SLP believes in my ability to improve, despite my chronic inability to focus on my psets and my tendency to use their Apple Pencil for goofy doodles.

Marla

Imagine how much resentment you would feel if you learned your parents dropped you on the head as a baby. Now picture that resentment, times a thousand. That’s probably the amount of hate that my phone feels for me. Marla is the phone I got before freshman year of high school, and who I continued to use (and drop) for the next five years. The hall of fame of places where I have dropped Marla: the floor of an aquarium bathroom, a plate of chickpeas, the parking lot of an In-N-Out. If Marla were a person and not an inanimate object, I think I probably would’ve been strangled alive by now. I imagine she was a kind, gentle soul once. But after feeling my dirty fingers on the daily and wearing cheap phone cases and having her 
        storage pushed to the limit
      
, she’s become bitter with rage, her electric dreams filled with vengeance.

She finally snapped a few weeks ago. While in Yerevan, Armenia for my 
        MISTI
      
 internship, I participated in Vardavar, a festival where everybody–men and women, young and old alike–splash water on each other as a form of blessing. I got soaked–and so did Marla! In one last act of rebellion, she started restarting at random times, and her display constantly scrolled up like the reels of a slot machine. She was rendered completely unusable. Thankfully, after a panicked email, I received money from MIT-Eurasia to fix Marla. Khachatur, an MIT Physics Phd from Armenia, and also our MISTI-Armenia program ambassador, recommended Pixel, a repair shop in the heart of Yerevan. I took the bus from my AirBnB in the hills, walked into the store, and waited. Part of me didn’t think Marla could ever be fixed. But another part of me held out hope that my relationship with Marla (and her screen) could finally take a turn for the better.

“My phone’s broken,” I said to the clerk when it was my time to be helped, “I think it’s water damage.”

“Well, it’s definitely damaged,” he replied, unamused. He motioned for me to follow him down a flight of stairs.

I descended into what can only be called an “EE Chamber.” A man hunched over a desk, where he worked to fix a phone with a screwdriver, its internal machinery scandalously exposed. His work was illuminated by a skinny desk lamp, and various wires and electrical parts were strewn across the desk. Behind him was a wall of semi-opaque cabinets of phone parts and other electrical equipment. I asked him how much the repairs would cost, and told him that I would check out the other repair stores in the area before coming back. But those were empty words–the choice had already been made. The moment I laid my eyes on the EE Chamber, I knew that that was no better place for Marla to be fixed.

In just one and a half hours, and for just $64, I came back to a healthy, working Marla, with an unbroken screen. I wanted to jump and scream in joy, relieved that I wouldn’t have to settle for a cheap burner phone, or spend the rest of my MISTI experience without data.

The next day, I ventured into an underground mall to buy a screen protector for Marla, determined not to fall prey to my 
        old mistakes
      
.

I think my relationship with Marla is improving. Yes, I’m still the same clumsy person I was before. But I genuinely try to care for her more, to make sure she doesn’t fly out of my hands or careen out of my 
        comically small pockets
      
. I know 5 years of constant physical (and emotional) pain is a lot to get over, but to me, it’s worth it to try to overcome.

The Faucet

In my freshman fall, I was unfortunate enough to end up in a triple on the 
        tenth floor
      
 of Simmons. I was mildly dehydrated during the first few weeks of college simply because I was too lazy to go all the way down to the first floor, fill up my water, and then go all the way back up to the tenth. That’s where The Faucet came in. Ever kind and ever gracious, The Faucet was built atop a defunct minifridge by my Course 2 neighbor. Its creation left me with a deep seated desire to defect from Course 6 that still remains in my soul. The Faucet is friendly and sociable, always willing to give more, to help those in their times of distress. He’s the type of friend to buy you a tub of ice cream after a bad breakup, or to binge entire seasons of a show he doesn’t like, just because you wanted to watch it with him. Whether it be my dehydrated freshman self, or my Connor 2 friend using water balloons to fight back against upperclassman hazing, The Faucet continues to provide us with refreshing, cool, water. I only hope The Faucet takes a bit more time for himself.

Jacques

Jacques loves adventures. Whether those adventures are learning the guitar over quarantine, earning an MIT pirate certificate, or exploring a decrepit cabin in the woods, Jacques is here for it. As a flashlight, Jacques knows he’s especially suited for those late night strolls and those Things He’s Not Allowed To Be Doing. I don’t think he’s happy that I brought him to MIT “just in case” and I haven’t used him a single time. Especially with Marla’s flashlight, he hasn’t been able to join in on any midnight walks, 3am snack runs, or even a nocturnal trip to The Faucet to refill my water bottle. He simply sits on a cabinet in my dorm room, dreaming about the adventures we could’ve gone on together. One day, I hope Jacques’ wish can finally come true.

Edward

My parents used an extra $2,000 in outside scholarship funds to purchase 
        Edward
      
, a Macbook for me to use during college. Edward became a nervous machine after joining my Apple Ecosystem and hearing Marla’s tales of violence and abuse. But to be fair, the worst Edward has experienced is a bunch of cutesy stickers stuck onto his back, which have since faded with age.

Edward’s laptop stickers!

Yes, there have been moments where I have ALMOST dropped Edward, don’t get me wrong. But I’ve caught him in all of those instances. And I got Edward a nice 
        Magic Mouse
      
 as well. I don’t think Edward should have any HR complaints to file against me–not that he would actually file them if he did, he’s the type of machine to try and fly under the radar, performing his duties adequately and 
        not trying to attract any attention
      
.

Pauline

Whether I’m taking 2 hours to watch a 45 minute lecture video or unironically typing “edgy nightcore music” into the Youtube search bar, Pauline doesn’t judge. She is the trusty set of headphones that my mom got me in my sophomore year of high school, who I started to appreciate more once I started living with roommates. Pauline is apathetic, and a little bit jaded. Whether that’s due to my mildly cursed listening history, or whether that’s just the way that she was 
        born
      
, I’m just thankful that she doesn’t judge, like a cashier who scans your 
        nine packs of salami
      
 without batting an eye. Unfortunately, though Pauline’s got the best internet tea and the best songs, I’ve never really learned much about her. She doesn’t tell me about herself often, though I’m certain she’s got some interesting things to say.

get SLAPped!,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",0,2024-09-21T00:00:00-04:00,"last year, i got an email from sandy, the head of house at east campus. my tenure as a physical resident of ec had just ended due to the initiation of a two-year renovation plan, but house team was still emailing us from time to time about events, dining hall swipes, free covid tests, and cool opportunities around campus. this email was in the last category, and i’ve unfortunately since 
        deleted it,
      
 but it was telling us two key things:

1. we can get free art from mit for our living spaces, and

2. the free art is REALLY GOOD.

the program is called SLAP, which stands for the student lending art program, and i suspect they chose the name at least partially for the sake of an amusing acronym. at the beginning of every academic year, the mit list visual arts center offers a lottery to all students (grad or undergrad) for a chance to pick out a piece from their collection that they can hang up in their room or common area. if you’re selected, you pick a time to visit the gallery and claim an artwork.

it’s a bit competitive — art goes on a first-come, first-serve basis, and there are a few that get snatched up right away.

i think i was still half-asleep from getting up too early while i was looking through their collection last year, which consists of mostly original prints and photography, when suddenly:

THEY HAVE A JENNY HOLZER PIECE?????????

(i spent a considerable amount of time in my formative years reblogging art and poetry on tumblr, and jenny holzer was always a big hit among my mutuals.)

now wide awake, i clicked through the rest of their collection and spotted yoshitomo nara works, along with some really beautiful photographs by doc edgerton.

i made a list of pieces i wanted before i went into the gallery so that i could find them more quickly. i left with a painting by ria brodell that seemed to be part of a series called butch heroes. looking it up, i found that brodell, a boston-based artist, had actually written a book by the same name with more paintings and texts about queer historical figures:

I was thinking about what my life would have been like had I been born into a different century. […] I supposed that queer people of the past must have found other ways to live, and I wanted to find out how they did so. […] For this project, I was looking for people in history with whom I can personally identify—people who were assigned female at birth, had documented relationships with women, and whose gender presentation was more masculine than feminine. […] Each portrait involved extensive research into all aspects of the person’s life, social class, occupation, clothing, and environment. […] In addition to the term’s traditional associations of being masculine in appearance or actions, I chose to use “Butch Heroes” to indicate people who were strong or brave in the way they lived their lives and challenged their societies’ strict gender roles.

this year, i signed up again (thanks to another one of sandy’s reminders) and was lucky enough to be chosen. my appointment was actually scheduled on the day of the mid-autumn festival, so when i popped into my lab’s office to say hi and check in with my pi, a postdoc offered me a 
        mooncake,
      
 which made me very happy. i took this as a good sign.

and it was, because when i went into the gallery, i found one of the yoshitomo nara pieces i had picked out still hanging on the wall. i was almost shaking as i took it off the hanger. it’s a print, not the original, otherwise i wouldn’t even want to breathe on it — but it’s still SO COOL. i brought it to the entrance to fill out paperwork and chatted about it with the people there.

(“good find! it’s a little creepy though, so make sure you can still sleep at night.”)



there’s something mesmerizing about the contrast between thick and thin lines here, as well as the waves meshing in with the figure’s hair, and the story it’s telling about gender. getting to look at this painting up close in my room and noticing all the little details is…really special.

if you’ll still be at mit next year, sign up for the lottery!! the list center has such an incredible collection. whatever you find is going to add a lot of character to your room. get SLAPped!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screen-Shot-2024-09-21-at-6.30.32-PM.png

Pics from the WMBRBQ!,Kayode D. '27,8,2024-09-20T00:00:00-04:00,"Hello friends!!

The semester has started, and I have been SWAMPED with work. I got all excited with the new semester and joined some new clubs, but didn’t drop any clubs from last year, so now I’m kind of overbooked, but this is entirely of my own doing. I have a ton of blog posts that are half-written and I need to work on/post soon. These young’ens are showing me up!

Anyways, 
        today
      
 was the WMBRBQ!

WMBR (Walker Memorial Basement Radio) is MIT’s student college radio station. It’s located under Walker Memorial building (duh) and it’s a full radio station! I love music so so so much, and being part of this station is one of my favorite things about MIT. Today we had a barbecue (the WMBRBQ) in the lawn next to Walker, and I signed up to be a photographer! These photos will also go on the WMBR Blog, and on the website, which you should totally go check out!! You can listen to WMBR @ 88.1FM on the radio in the greater Boston area, and @ wmbr.org worldwide!

Me and my roommate have a radio show called Midwest Pizzeria that airs at 7pm on Sunday nights. There’s plenty of other great shows, like Bats in the Belfry, The Hot Rat Sessions, The…, and of course, Porcelain Cow. [Full show schedule with descriptions here!] You can also go back and listen to 2 weeks worth of radio archives, so if you miss something it’s no big deal!

During Covid, a lot of people began doing their shows remotely, and we’re still working on getting the number of live shows back to normal. This makes events like the WMBRBQ so epic, because you get to see all kinds of people that you didn’t even know were a part of the station!

 

Check out WMBR.org ! It’s pretty neato, bandito!

 

this took an incredibly long time to create. the camera i was using took photos in a format called .NEF, which is unique to the Nixon Camera brand. And it can’t be uploaded to this website in that form, so i had to convert every single one. God has cursed me for my hubris and my work is never done. have a good weekend, everyone, and listen to some good radio!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/k0LCqfNk.jpeg

things that made me happy lately,Kai V. '25,2,2024-09-20T00:00:00-04:00,"It was the morning of the second or third day of classes and I had brewed jasmine tea at the 
        pika
      
 kitchen counter and was sipping it while listening in on breakfast conversations. “The curse of this degree is that now I perceive every building I enter really intensely,” said our 
        GRA
      
, a PhD student in Course 4 (architecture). “How do you perceive pika?” someone asked. “It’s a little structurally alarming sometimes,” our GRA admitted.

It was early—8 a.m.—so only a few people were awake. People talked in low tones about physical chemistry and the recitations they had to attend or TA. pika gets much louder at night, and since our mealplan is open to anyone we can have upwards of forty people at dinner. But mornings feel cold and quiet and serene.

I moved into pika this fall, which makes me feel almost froshlike. I have a new roommate (hi Uzay), new room, new living group. I hang up all my posters on the brick wall facing my and Uzay’s desks. Every day, it seems, another poster falls, and I stick it back on grimly with another layer of masking tape. When I come home from classes I linger in the 
        CGE
      
 to strike up conversations with my housemates while they work or snack, about why small modular reactors suck or why we think another housemate gives Virginia vibes or our collective love for soy milk.

It’s sort of how I imagined my freshman year would go. Though my first year here didn’t end up going badly, it also wasn’t at all what I expected. Mostly I felt confused and disoriented—maybe because my prefrontal cortex hadn’t developed yet; maybe because I knew less than I do now about what was available to me at MIT; maybe because I entered college fresh out of the pandemic and it took a few months (or years) to feel like a productive, social creature again.

Whatever the case, things feel simpler now. pika held a zine-making workshop the other night as part of chill week, which is a week filled with events for new people to have an excuse to come over and get to know pika. We ate Trader Joe’s ice cream mochi together and cut out parts of magazines and glued them to folded cardstock. I had just made dinner for everyone, which included this strangely textured orange mushroom that someone had foraged. I was behind on all my work and the semester had barely even started. In some ways this is a simple narrative: friends, food, firehose. That’s what I expected coming in, and it wasn’t until very recently that I found it, but now it’s mine.

A few words about my classes, which are also making me happy. I’m taking:

6.2220 [Power Electronics Laboratory]: This class makes it trivial to manage my time. It takes over 20 hours a week and you can only do the high-voltage work in lab. Thus, I have no choice but to go to lab whenever I can, and when lab is closed I work on my other classes. Of course sitting in lab poking transistors into breadboard sockets for five hours straight is exhausting sometimes, but other times I look at the signals on my oscilloscope screen and think, this is awesome, I could look at oscilloscope signals forever.

18.404 [Theory of Computation]: For a long time I have thought in a non-rigorous way about how humans and machines process information. It’s probably one of the most interesting concepts in the world to me. I think this shows in what I like to write about, too: how things like memory and art and love flow through and are crystallized in our 
        information-processing pipelines.
      
 Now this class will help me rigorize my thinking, which I am excited for. I know it sounds like wishy-washy mysticism to be tying all these things together but they’re truly very intertwined in my mind.

18.112 [Complex Analysis]: This class is just okay so far. But it motivates me to read my very good complex analysis textbook, so I’m happy with it. The complex plane is quite beautiful!

21G.111 [Chinese Calligraphy]: In this class, we meditate and write pretty Chinese characters for three hours a week. I think handwriting is such an intimate thing—I wish it was more normalized to handwrite and send letters to friends. I keep everything people handwrite for me: a note on the front page of a novel, For Kai, From Amos. Or a years-old birthday card, Happy Birthday, From Joseph. It’s this very beautiful evidence of existence and intention. In particular my best writing is always, always done pen-to-paper.
 There’s something about feeling your fingers physically form the words that forces an understanding and rhythm that isn’t necessarily there when you type, instead watching your words form impersonally in front of you, in a pre-rendered font with predetermined spacings. Anyway—the point is—I’m so excited to take a whole class dedicated to studying and practicing handwriting closely and deliberately.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_20240917_1652376122-800x600.jpg

hokey pokey,Janet G. '27,8,2024-09-19T00:00:00-04:00,"The school year has begun again. I’m glad to report that some things never change: aside from all the frosh complaining about 
        why building 26 is bunched between 12 and 36,
      
 the massive flurry of dormspams as clubs begin to campaign for energetic frosh labour, there’s also the various ice breakers so that everyone can pretend to be friends with each other in a 30 person class. 

The icebreakers that I’ve done this year are somehow more interesting than usual; my anthropology class teacher asked us to say our name and a small story related to our name, and my 
        6.1210
      
 TA asked us for our favourite ice cream flavours. 

If you ever meet me, one of the first things you will figure out about me is that I’m a 
        Kiwi.
      
 I’m sure you’ve noticed the 
        spelling that feels slightly off,
      
 and people do often introduce me as the token 
        New Zealander.
      
 Throughout my freshman year, I’ve managed to collect a pretty sizeable list of “things that tip people off”. 

Some of these items include: 

- my accent (“can you say no for me?”)

- my confusion at what a 
        foot 
      
is 

- my confusion at what it means for a day to feel like it’s NINETY DEGREES (ah yes sometimes i too feel like a square, which is far more likely than me getting boiled alive in 90 deg C)

- writing the date the ‘wrong way’ (so apparently, 9/12 is september twelfth and not the ninth of december). 

Apparently, ice cream flavours now also belong on this list. My favourite flavour of ice cream is hokey pokey, which is vanilla ice cream dotted with these tiny balls of delicious golden crisp honeycomb toffee. I knew from previous experience that people here had no idea what hokey pokey was, and for once I wanted to be slightly more normal and surely choose a flavour that wasn’t as stand-out-weird. So when the introduction train finally came around to me, I was like, this is my chance. I’ll choose my second favourite flavour. 

“Hi! I’m Janet. I’m a sophomore planning on studying 
         6-4 
      
 and 
        7,
      
 and my favourite ice cream flavour… is boysenberry.” 
The room paused for a moment. The TA looked at me, and was like, 
“huh. boysenberry. haven’t heard that one before.” 
Somewhere in the room, someone snickered. “did she just say poisonberry?”

“Hi! I’m Janet. I’m a sophomore planning on studying 
         6-4 
      
 and 
        7,
      
 and my favourite ice cream flavour… is boysenberry.” 

The room paused for a moment. The TA looked at me, and was like, 

“huh. boysenberry. haven’t heard that one before.” 

Somewhere in the room, someone snickered.

“did she just say poisonberry?”

And that’s when I knew I fucked up. Apparently, Boysenberry is not an American ice cream flavour EITHER? 

My childhood was spent running barefoot to the dairy to buy a $2 ice block. I only realised that squirrels were real when I arrived in America. Even the night sky looks different: I’d never seen the Big Dipper before coming to New England. There’s a lot of moments at MIT that remind me of how different this school is from the place where I grew up. This is as exciting as it is daunting; when everything is different, you get the chance to become someone different too. 

Maybe this is the point of these icebreakers. Everything is about who you are now and what you will become. What’s your name? Where do you live? What do you want to major in? Who do you want to be? There’s no talk about what you’ve done. MIT is full of a particularly concentrated brand of academic overachiever. You’re not special if you’re smart, incredibly hardworking, or 
        incredibly lazy.
      
 When academic overachievement is no longer your defining feature, who do you become? I’ve seen friends who chill out and play minecraft until 3am; friends who fell in love with glassblowing and help make the prettiest pumpkins; friends who jump into poker and just earn a lot of money while having fun. My friends who are most assured in themselves are the ones who let themselves explore and try on different identity-forming things. 

I’ve explored a bunch too! I did a lot of debating before college, but when I joined I decided that I didn’t want to 
        feed the hyper-competitive part of myself. 
      
 Instead, I joined clubs that really work towards building things collaboratively, and now I work with many of the coolest people I know in 
        HackMIT. 
      
I learned to whittle things down and not try to do 7 extracurriculars at once, to not take on so much responsibility and delegate better. I’m a Kiwi, obviously, and I’m still figuring out that part of my identity; do I want to have it be so emphasised? 

I think it’s okay though. My friends know me more than just my labels. They know me as Janet, the one who they made grilled cheese with at 3am, the one who they shopping carted to the 
        5.111
      
 final, the one who they pulled an all-nighter psetting with. College is great! It’s really been a chance for me to explore and figure things out, and also to feel enabled to say cheesy shit like “yeah yeah but have you considered the real identity are the friends we made along the way”. 

Nice to meet you! I’m Janet. I’ve been thinking about what it means to be a Kiwi, I study CS and biology, and I want to find things I love in the world and highlight them. My favourite ice cream flavour in the world is Hokey Pokey, and you should come try it with me sometime!",,0
greta gerwig’s barbie and insecurity,Aiden H. '28,5,2024-09-19T00:00:00-04:00,"As of this weekend, I have watched Greta Gerwig’s 2023 blockbuster Barbie six (6) times. I have also cried to Greta Gerwig’s 2023 blockbuster Barbie five (5) times, almost always multiple times during the movie. Although the “I’m Just Ken” memes and bright pink were shoved down everyone’s throats enough for society to collectively forget about the movie after last fall, my obsession continues. 

So when walking back from dinner at New Vassar with my roommate, I was appalled to hear he missed out on the Barbenheimer craze. That same night, we hunkered down in the Maseeh basement media room and watched the movie. He thought it was fine, but I naturally rekindled my love of the movie and feel inclined to revisit it.

Now I know I’m far from the first person to talk about Barbie, and its importance to modern feminist movements is something I cannot comment on nor relate to. Still, like any piece of art, I find it impossible not to pull out my own interpretations and personal connection to the movie–how it perfectly encapsulates my feelings of self-doubt and attitude towards the “real world”. So having revisited the movie in my first month at MIT, the themes were stark and unavoidable reflections on how I’ve been feeling once again.

So here’s the (very long winded) beginning of my college experience, through Barbie.

 

***

 

“The real world isn’t what I thought it was.” — Barbie

 

Like a lot of high school students, I spent the majority of my senior year both stressing over and romanticizing college life. After my admission and with a summer countdown in full swing, this romanticization felt tangible. I spent hours watching MIT vlogs on Youtube, researching potential classes I could take, looking at majors I knew I would never pick (mechanical engineering) and comparing dorm options. Soon enough, MIT was the picturesque landscape for the indie movie I convinced myself I was starring in. And for the most part, I would argue these moments have existed for me at MIT.

 

What I forgot about was everything in between.

 

In Barbie, it’s unknown where the Kens go when the Barbie’s aren’t around–they merely sit and wait for Barbie to be in a plot relevant enough to need them there, too. In my head, I was yearning for the shiny, fake, and unattainable, too. So the moment I noticed that my life here would not be constant parties, trips to quaint Boston cafes, and doing world-changing research, my perception shattered. MIT, despite all its glory, is also just another place I live now. I’m still sitting in bed doom scrolling on my phone, binge watching sitcoms, and doing homework at my desk. Somehow, I’ll have to swap the idea of MIT for what is actually is–somewhere I love, but not in the ways I expected.

“I’m not pretty anymore” – Barbie

 

Just like anything that stays in its environment too long, I grew accustomed to the “role” and personality designated to me. In middle and high school, as pretentious as it sounds, I was always used to being close to the top of my class. After a while, I intentionally strived to maintain that not because I felt a fundamental necessity to, but because I wouldn’t know who I was if I weren’t that guy. It was the shiny box I put myself into not because I wanted to be contained, but because I was hoping people would notice me. 

As both everyone could guess and everyone did tell me, I am very far from the most talented person at MIT. And shockingly, I feel like I’m doing very well handling this newfound academic insecurity. Even though I took the high school equivalent of three of my classes this semester, I have already found myself a) lost on campus, b) crying over code, and c) demoralized at my inability to solve problems with the grace or speed of my peers. Suddenly, I was not the person people turned to, but the person begging for help. 

My insecurity stems less from not being able to ace every assignment, but from arriving in a new environment where suddenly the starting point to introduce my personality to others is lost. 

In high school, I would make jokes with friends that once in college I could completely change who I am–I could speak with a fake accent, dye my hair, and tell everyone I’m distantly related to a famous TikTok star. It turns out that in a weird way, I am being forced to reinvent my personality–to find a point of basic connection outside what classes I’m in or extracurriculars I joined because everyone here is in the same boat. This isn’t to say I think the only aspect of me in high school was my academics; however, it was the only part of me that most people knew.

Stereotypical Barbie is known for being just that: her stereotypical, picture-perfect self. Who are we if not what we are called by others? What happens when we lose the one thing we’ve attached to ourselves to put us apart? What happens when, in the middle of everything we could’ve ever wanted, we don’t feel special anymore?

“That’s life. It’s all change.” – Gloria

 

My beige flag is that I don’t really move on from things, for better or for worse (as proven by my continual use of ‘beige flag’). Like a lot of people, I act like I love to embrace change and go on crazy adventures, and then as soon as I’m confronted with it I become devastatingly nostalgic. At every corner, I look for the opportunity to become pessimistic and prove to myself that my decision for change was stupid and that I should retreat into the life I had. 

I got COVID the weekend before classes started (almost definitely from a frat party that wasn’t entirely worth it). With little options, I sat in my room demoralized and as melodramatic as ever waiting out my symptoms. mixed with the two-weeks-since-moving homesickness, it felt as if my decision to embrace change was being tested, like I was being shown I had made the wrong choice. 

But what about all the changes I’ve needed, and just decided I wasn’t going to focus on? Walking around Boston is far more entertaining than my street in Colorado, and sitting in classes with the most enthusiastic professors I’ve ever seen has reinvigorated a sense of passion for classwork that senioritis effectively killed. 

I have to remember that in 4 years, leaving MIT will be the change I dread, wanting to return to the life I have now.

“Even if you can’t make it perfect, you can make it better.” — Sasha

 

Despite Barbie’s attempts to fix her dreamland after seeing it destroyed by the Kens, Barbie remains notably apathetic and disappointed at the end of the movie. She created the world everyone else wanted, but after seeing through the facade, decided she couldn’t move on blissfully ignorant of what it truly was. 

This is a lot of what aging and being a person has felt like–becoming aware of awful shit and doing my best to tolerate it. My family calls this pessimism; to me, it’s my sincerest form of optimism. In being tested in my ability to extract what I can out of situations that inevitably will never meet the expectations I put forth in my head (whether it be for myself or the situation around me), everything begins to level out. The trophies and the punches are equal. 

While at MIT, I hope that I don’t treat it as a landscape where my level of perfection is tested, parading myself around to fit into a system I created in my head. I also hope that I find the balance of realism about how life will be and also an innate satisfaction about the beauty of being here. 

I guess all I’m trying to say is, I’m still trying to learn that I am Kenough, whoever and wherever I am.

"my first year, in slices",Veronica P. '27,3,2024-09-18T00:00:00-04:00,"“The muscles of my soul, longing for the opportunity to feel and fear and push, know they would otherwise atrophy.” 

 

I wrote this line roughly a month before move-in, in an effort to capture just what it was about the college experience that drew me. Fresh out of high school, with my hometown chapter tied neatly in a bow, I felt- quite honestly- bored. I craved excitement, wanted my life to take the shape of any proper coming-of-age novel: rife with unanticipated twists, huge thrills, daunting challenges, quintessentially adolescent intensity, and, ultimately, growth. 

 

Life doesn’t always work out this way, but, a year later, I can report that I got exactly what I was looking for. Amongst adjacent adventures, I had that “canon event” freshman year friend group experience: the chain of events- more precisely those of the powder keg variety- that unfold when a group of wildly different people, plunging into a wildly different life, cling onto the first people they meet and- seeking some sense of community- see those connections through far longer than they would under any other circumstance. 

 

Do I regret it? No, not at all. For every bridge burned, there were some incredible, genuine connections formed.  Even for those bonds that didn’t last, I’m a firm believer in the notion that people come into your life to teach you something; they aren’t always meant to stay, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing- or anyone’s fault.  

 

Besides, I don’t want to look back on this period of my life and fixate on the soap-opera-ness of it all. Those moments have a tendency to stick regardless, and how can you possibly expect anyone- yourself included- to know exactly how to react whilst confronted with a million changes at once? 

 

At the end of the day, the moments that I’d like to linger on- the moments I want to press gently against my chest and rerun in my mind- were the smaller quirks and joys. Those moments of my first year that made my life feel like a silly little slice-of-life sitcom, blessed with a cast of truly remarkable people.

 

And one of the best parts about a sitcom is that you can tune in at any moment. So, without further ado, here’s a nonlinear series of glimpses into my freshman year at MIT:

9PM. The first night of CPW. 

Our roommate- hosting two prefrosh- had the air mattress pump and her phone on DND.  In one last attempt to get a hold of her, seeing her Find My location somewhere within the Baker sphere, we took to yelling on the sidewalk:

 

“YOUR CHILDREN NEED YOU!” 

“HELLOOOOO” 

“YOU’RE A HORRIBLE MOTHER!!!!” 

 

Disheartened, we began our trudge back. 

 

A facetime notification. 

 

“Is that y’all screaming outside the 4W Lounge window!?” 

 

Victory.

“So you’re telling me if I listen to The Periodic Table Song all night I’ll pass my 5.111 final?”

 

“That’s not what I’m saying at all-” 

 

“Too late. Just watch me.”

“Wait, I know we all just met, but you can help me convince these Phi Delts guys I’m an MIT student, right? Like, give me a major.” 

 

“Omg yes. When we get to the door just say you’re a Course 6. Everyone’s a Course 6- they’ll never question it.”

‘SCREAM AT THE RIVER IN 5 MIN EOM.’

“I just feel like we keep going off on tangents, we need to focus” 

 

“Hmm, so essentially… we’re deriving, and you need me to integrate, right?”

“I think you’re like Flourine, you know? You just feel this huge need to be bonded to someone.”

Early bird runners slipped past us on the Harvard Bridge as the sun rose over the first day of finals season. The group of us, dreary eyed from an adventurous all-nighter but holding out for Baker Breakfast, leaned against the railing as Bruno Mars rang out of our handheld speaker. 

 

“Same time next year?” 

 

“Are we on PNR next year?” 

 

“Right.”

tunes of interphase!,Angie F. '28,14,2024-09-17T00:00:00-04:00,"I. Lift – Radiohead

I didn’t really have a good senior year. My hometown started closing in on me in October, and it would’ve kept doing so until I collapsed under the pressure had I not gotten an MIT acceptance letter in December. I held tight onto the breath of fresh air I took in that day for months, and the effort of it made me blue in the face by March. 
        Sin LiMITe
      
 and 
        CPW
      
 rolled around, and I left that sleepless, exhilarating set of weekends with a song stuck in my head–

This is the place Sit down, you’re safe now You’ve been stuck in a lift We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom This is the place It won’t hurt ever again

This is the place

Sit down, you’re safe now

You’ve been stuck in a lift

We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom

This is the place

It won’t hurt ever again

–and two main things on my mind:

- MIT really was everything I’d imagined it to be– and more. Somewhere out there, there was a place where I could finally breathe.

- A page in my notes app that just said 
        “Interphase”
      



  
          
        
      
          
        
      
          
        
      
      
      all smiles at Sin LiMITe :)

For months, all I’d wanted to do was leave. Now, I had a chance to do so early, and address my main worry about MIT in the process: I hadn’t taken physics since an algebra-based distance learning class during freshman year and didn’t really have a strong hold on chem, either, so I knew I’d have to spend my summer playing catchup. I asked my parents for permission, put my all into my application, and waited, holding my breath once more and only letting go once I got that acceptance letter in my email. I spent the month that followed feeling Puerto Rico turn into something like a waiting room: everything that I loved still stood out, but all the things that I disliked became easier and easier to shrug away. After all, I was going home.

I was still kind of nervous though– as I packed my bags, as I boarded the plane, as I walked to the front door of my dorm and felt Maseeh tower over me. If I didn’t like Interphase, then I wouldn’t be able to call what I was doing “moving out” anymore: instead, I would be running away from all the things that had made my hometown such an unpleasant place to be during my senior year. I’d be letting them win.

But as the people I’d be sharing a floor with for the next seven weeks began to filter into the halls, as I set up my bed and color coordinated my closet and put together my lava lamp, I felt some of these fears begin to subside. Passing by strangers who I knew would soon become friends, I breathed in and out for the first time in what felt like months, and Maseeh became a place that wasn’t quite home yet, but could be.

Today is the first day of the rest of your days So lighten up, squirt

II. This Charming Man – The Smiths

My time at Interphase turned from one of meek, apprehension-riddled excitement to a vibrant whirlwind of a life, a change that was as sudden and striking as the guitar riff that follows a second of silence at the beginning of this song. It blasted through my headphones during trips through the Infinite to get to class or the Edgerton Center and runs across Killian Court just for the heck of it. I listened to it during conversations about nothing and everything and all that lies in the nerdy in between in the Maseeh 2 lounge, p-set sessions in the basement, and most notably, while walking across the Harvard Bridge with two Interphasers who would go on to become some of my best friends, Carlos and Fabián. Something most people will (unwillingly) come to know about me is that I can do a mean impression of Morrissey, the widely and rightfully disliked lead singer of The Smiths. It’s something that my friends from home have honestly gotten kind of sick of, so I was incredibly surprised to hear Carlos and Fabián’s impressed reactions to me singing along to the chorus of this song. As silly as it was, it filled me with a weird sense of peace: all the things about me that had become commonplace back home were exciting and new here, and I could pick and choose which ones I wanted to leave behind and which I wanted to keep. No one at MIT knew about my Morrissey impression, and I didn’t know about theirs. There were a million things I couldn’t wait to share with everyone I was growing to love here, and even more I couldn’t wait for them to share back. On that bridge, the sun was already beginning to hide itself behind the Boston skyline, but to me, it looked like it was just starting to rise.

III. East Coast – Alex G

One of the first things I learned from upperclassmen at Sin LiMITe was that everyone at MIT will get many grueling but surpassable reality checks during their time there, usually starting in their first semester. And, of course, in typical prefrosh fashion, I nodded along while silently telling myself that it didn’t apply to me. I thought that, by accepting early on that MIT would kick my butt, the effects of the butt-kicking itself would be mitigated. After all, I’d already given myself a reality check: I’d repeated all the classic lines, about how MIT is meant to be hard and half of the people here go from being in the top 10% of their high school class to the bottom 50% of their college one, to myself over and over. Going into Interphase, I expected to struggle with physics and chemistry… but not math. After all, I’d always been good at it: AP Calculus BC was (mostly) a cakewalk, and I managed to test into Interphase’s Calc 3 class despite never having taken multivar. When I got my first p-set, I approached it just as I would’ve in high school, hunkering down over the assignment at my desk the day it was due with nothing but my class notes and my noise-canceling headphones. This went about as well as you’d expect, and as 11:59 PM inched closer and closer, it was my friend Daniel walking into the study room to find me approaching hysterics that stopped me from failing to submit anything at all, though what I had was still not enough to earn me a passing grade. As I uploaded my work to Gradescope, I sobbed to this guy I’d known for barely two weeks about how this was “the worst assignment I’d ever submitted.” He reassured me that, after this, I’d be way ahead of everyone else in 18.02 in the fall, but all I could do was shake my head: in that moment, I didn’t feel like I could ever be ahead of anyone. 

This, of course, caught up to me fairly quickly, with my professor reaching out to offer support shortly after the due date. As embarrassed as I initially was, I quickly realized there was no reason to be: he and the TAs were incredibly understanding, and all they wanted to do was help. It took me a while to accept that I needed it, and I worked through another p-set alone, listening to this song whenever I got especially frustrated. But I slowly let it sink in that collaboration was necessary at thrive at MIT, a realization that was easy to have once I started noticing all the things people around me achieved by simply putting aside their pride and leaning on each other, getting twice my results with only half of my struggle: the moment that pushed me to internalize this the most was walking out of the study room angry at myself for not making much progress on a problem on my second p-set, only to find that five of my classmates had been debating that same problem at a board in the lounge for the last hour. I accepted my professor’s offer to have one-on-one office hours with him and a TA twice a week and made an effort to ask for help even when it made me feel silly, both in and out of academic contexts (notable example: the time I looked around HMart for something for somewhere between five and ten minutes before sucking it up and asking an employee about it, only to find that they didn’t have what I was looking for at all). It is, admittedly, a massive work in progress, one I suspect I’ll be grappling with for a good amount of my MIT career, if not longer. However, being able to learn strategies to deal with it early on has been one of the most invaluable benefits of Interphase. I’ve already made more progress on this issue this summer than I had in my entire academic career leading up to it, both because of the support of the program staff and the presence of my peers, from Daniel in the study room to everyone else who showed me that even the smartest people get confused sometimes. 

One day in the dining hall, a group of wide-eyed high schoolers came up to the Interphase table, flooding us with questions about essays and stats and application tips. “Do any of you feel like you got in with a mid application?” one of them asked. I raised my hand, and was shocked to see every other person at that table– a table filled with robotics geniuses and cancer researchers and math magicians– do the same. The flip side of the MIT community’s commendable humility is that imposter syndrome is almost a campus-wide epidemic; however, this means that there’s never a shortage of kindness from your peers when the disease reaches you.

IV. Mr. Brightside – The Killers

A staple of Interphase 2024 is the vibrant party scene… ok, not really. Over the course of the summer, my friends Isa and Carlos took it upon themselves to host three “raves” that all of Interphase agrees were, in short, “a movie.” Prompted by jokes about the behemoth that is the thousand-person Boston Welcome Week Rave in the fall, they put together lights, a sound system, and the best Spotify queue known to man in the Maseeh 2 lounge, bringing the whole cohort (and a few RFAs) together for a night of singing, dancing, and karaoke. As I jumped around singing my heart out to this song, it struck me that none of the things that usually would have mattered to me in a situation like this– whether I knew the lyrics or not, my criminal inability to dance (expect a blog post about my learning experience at the Latin Dance Club at some point), who was or wasn’t watching– were on my mind at all. 

Over the course of the summer, I picked up on something a little odd: my laugh had started to change. It started with just my closest friends, but over time, I found the same barely familiar sound coming out of my mouth at every joke or funny story, no matter where I was or who was telling it. It was the sound of someone without a reserved bone in their body, the unrestrained laugh I’d usually kept deep inside me save for the most special occasions. Now, though, I heard it constantly, and it was at one of these raves that I realized with a start why: I didn’t have to hold myself back here. Not only was I happier, I was also just more me. With all the p-sets and late night Cambridge Pizza runs and bellyaching laughing fits taking up my days, I hadn’t found the time to water down the parts of myself I usually made sure to squash meticulously. The deep breaths I’d worked so hard to take on my first day at Interphase were shallow compared to the ones I took every second now, staring right at the person I was becoming and realizing I was excited to see what I’d turn into. 

Another thing I realized at one of these raves: I cannot sing for the life of me. But when I was pushed into the middle of a dance circle during “Creep” by Radiohead, I delivered nonetheless. Here’s a video of that for your viewing… pleasure? Displeasure? Watch it and see for yourself.

V. Scattered Blue Light – September

It was Sunday past 8PM and I still had $60 of my weekly Interphase TechCash stipend left. Unless I wanted to eat leftover Cambridge Pizza for the next week, the only place where I could reasonably spend the money that was still open was HMart. I slipped on my headphones, put this song on loop, and began walking over there. 

The first half of the summer had fallen behind me and I was watching the second one rapidly follow suit. My recent midterm grades, my upcoming p-sets, the next steps for my Edgerton project, the friends I already had and all the ones I was still making, my room and our raves and all the countless laughs I’d had with people who I could trust to hold me up when I needed it, no matter what– the song’s soft guitar intro and the constant horn honking and chatter of Cambridge blended together to score my rising stream of thoughts, finally allowed to wander after being walled off by yet another day of constant activity. By the time I got to HMart, my whole summer was rushing through my mind, rising in intensity with the song’s melody before they both fell to a lull as I came to a realization: I didn’t need anything. From HMart or anywhere else. I already had everything I wanted.

I asked my friends if they wanted anything and ended up leaving the store with a towering bag of fruits for Carlos, guava candies for Daniel, and an unreasonable amount of instant ramen for everyone else, the song starting over as I stepped out into the hush of Cambridge at twilight. As I looked up at the impossibly deep blue sky, it hit me that I was walking through a city, my city, alone with a towering bag of groceries. That every waking moment I had belonged to me, taking place in a little world I’d carved out all for myself. I’d failed a p-set and gotten a new laugh and found people who liked my Morrissey impression, and in doing so, I’d lived a life that was truly all my own for the very first time.



It’s all beginning to end It’s all beginning to end

It’s all beginning to end

It’s all beginning to end

In a few weeks, I’d pack my bags and leave my summer room, feeling a slight apprehension at the thought of returning home and putting my new life on pause. But even then I’d know that, no matter what, I could always dig up those experiences from the back of my mind and breathe. In the days that hung between our early move-ins to our fall dorms and my brief departure from campus before orientation began, I’d run from dorm to dorm with my friends, feeling my little corner of the world grow slightly with each laugh-filled step. We’d choose one to end our adventure at, curling up on a lounge couch to watch some stupid TV show none of us cared about nearly as much as we cared about the fact that we were watching it together. And they’d get up to play pool but I’d stay there, closing my eyes and letting their newly familiar voices and laughs guide me to sleep. I’d hear them say look, she’s asleep a few minutes before I actually was, and catch a few words of them debating the best way to wake me up when it was time to leave. Like a kid falling asleep on the way back from a grownup party, pretending not to wake up when the car stopped and one of my parents picked me up, tucked me into bed, and gave me a kiss on the cheek, I’d stand somewhere outside my little world and let a warm feeling fill my chest at the sight of how everything unfolded when I wasn’t around. And I’d feel ready for another eternity in it, though, for now, four more years would do.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6651-400x414.jpeg

dance dance dance!,Ellie F. '28,6,2024-09-17T00:00:00-04:00,"Anyone who knows me from high school or Mathcamp or 
        SSP
      
 knows that I have the tendency to do everything. I’m in clubs and choirs, running events, and starting (and sometimes even finishing!) silly side projects constantly. Doing things makes me happy, even though it makes my schedule a bit claustrophobic. But hey! PNR exists for a reason, and now seems like the best time to try everything I can.

If you’ve ever seen me near music, you’ll quickly learn that I love to dance. I’m a Minecraft parrot—put any kind of music near me, and I start grooving and schmoving. I’ll bop to classical, rap, and the hold music that plays when I try to call customer service. I’ll nod along to songs I know by heart, and much more often, music that I’ve never heard in my life.

actual footage of me

I’ve been dancing my whole life, but when Covid struck, I stopped taking classes. For all of high school, I danced at home for fun, twirling through my kitchen in socks and pulling so many pique turns and pirouettes in my backyard that I wore holes into four (4) pairs of tennis shoes. But I really miss dancing with other people, and I want to improve! So, on the first weekend after classes started, I decided to try every dance audition or event I could fit into my schedule.
 Why? Why not? 

It begins

My auditionmaxxing weekend started with the DanceTroupe showcase. I rolled up with a cup filled with cereal because I didn’t have time to get breakfast, and settled back to enjoy the show. We got to see the choreographers show off all their dances, in hip-hop inspired, contemporary, ballet, and tap styles.

Speaking of tap, the next item on my agenda was an miTAP audition! Having not tapped in half a decade (!!), I was definitely pretty underprepared—I was the only person that didn’t have tap shoes. After warm-ups, I discovered the joy (not) of trying to do pullbacks in tennis shoes. But the miTAP officers were so sweet and let me adapt. Then, we learned a short routine. Even though my final rendition was very far from perfect, I was so happy to try tapping again with such talented dancers. 

Afterwards, I had a serendipitous run-in with Jorge, a current sophomore who taught our friends and I some Latin dances at CPW. He mentioned he was going to his club’s Casino Rueda class, and I had free time, so I joined the circle and learned moves like guapea, dame directo, and un fly.


non-dance break (but it’s still musical!)

Between all the dancing, I also auditioned for the Video Game Orchestra (VGO) as a violist! It was the chillest and most enjoyable audition I had ever been to. I just had to play a scale and do some sightreading, and I even got to play The Legend from Deltarune for my prepared piece. 

Okay back to dancing :) This time, I went to the Ballroom Dance Team’s team match event, where members of the ballroom dance team were paired with rookies in six dances: foxtrot, waltz, rumba, cha-cha, and swing. Because of my VGO audition, I arrived late, so I wasn’t competing. Instead, I got to admire the pairs dance very beautifully around the floor and cheer for the even numbered team.

Immediately after, I went to Bhangra! Bhangra is a style of dance from the Punjab area of India, and it is so joyful and energetic. I’ve definitely never tried anything similar to it, but the team taught us the basic moves really well. The room was really really hot (⅔ of the fans were broken), and we were jumping and double-bouncing constantly, but the music and dance were so purely fun and happy that I didn’t even mind (okay just a little). Still, I deserved SO MUCH ice cream after that much exercise.

Dawn of the Second Day

The biggest part of Sunday was auditions for DanceTroupe. My first audition was for contemporary, and we learned a routine to Torn. I realized that I missed dancing contemporary a lot! I love getting to be dramatic and trying to convey emotions through my movements.

how i probably looked

After my contemporary audition, I went to ballet. I did barre for the first time in years and am still sore from 
        adagio.
      
 We also did all sizes of jumps and leaps! Wheeeee! Overall, the DanceTroupe auditions were very relaxed and not stressful at all, and I think they’d be a great experience for anyone interested in dancing, at all skill levels.

Bonus round!! I also auditioned for Next Sing, an acapella group. It was short and sweet, with some range tests as a warmup, rhythm and pitch matching tests, an optional sight-reading, and a short excerpt from a song I chose (part of Killer Instinct from Bring It On)

5/5 Stars, would recommend!

Auditioning, or any way of putting yourself out there, is kinda scary. I felt a bit intimidated many times over my weekend of auditions, but I bet I’ll feel the same way a lot while I’m at MIT. More than that, though, I felt welcomed at every audition I went to. I’m taking that as a sign to keep trying a little bit of everything that interests me, like an easily distractible kid in a candy store. Maybe I’ll find a new hobby, a new friend, a new community, or maybe I won’t. But that’s alright, because either way, I’ll keep dancing and doing the things I love.

wahoo!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/groovin-400x225.jpg

LET ME COOOOOOOK 🍳🍳🍳,Fiona L. '27,4,2024-09-16T00:00:00-04:00,"“On a scale from one to ten, where one is ‘Eat to Live,’ and ten is ‘Live to Eat,’ where would you rate yourself?”

The question was asked at a fancy restaurant in Republic Square, Yerevan, after I and some other 
        MISTI
      
 interns had returned from an excursion to Dilijan, a neighboring city in Armenia.

I thought about how I would rate myself. I had grown up in a family of people who loved to eat. Whenever I went out with friends, I would always want to do something food related. I saw these hangouts not just as an opportunity to spend time with my friends, but also as a chance to get poke bowls at the mall, try out a new restaurant downtown, or indulge in desserts. I’m easily tempted with cake and bribed with chips or candy. Sometimes, during particularly stressful or loathsome days, my meals were the main thing I looked forward to. In fact, in the past overeating was a problem for me: sometimes I’d have a particularly good meal and then experience an “ohmygodimgonnagetatummyachetomorrowwhydididothat” kind of thing.

(Even as I’m writing this blog post, I’m eating a particularly tasty bowl of pho.)

“I’d probably be a nine,” I replied. “Or maybe a ten.” 

With all this in mind, it’s a surprise that I never learned how to cook. My parents were never that big on cooking: I remember my high school meals being comprised of microwaved food and Chinese takeout. My mom and dad both worked demanding jobs, and didn’t have time to cook for my brother and I. Apart from one summer where I mastered only a single simple dish–the glorious sunny side up egg–I also didn’t find time to learn how to cook. Most of my time was spent on school, extracurriculars, and preparing for the 
        impending reality of college decisions
      
.

Still, I don’t want to seem like I’m ungrateful for my parents. Speaking from a college student’s perspective, I really, really miss being able to 
        sit down at the dinner table with my family
      
. All the time that my parents spent working was time they sacrificed to keep me and my brother fed and comfortable.

Unfortunately, I didn’t make any progress on my cooking last year either. I spent my freshman year at Simmons, where I relied on the mandatory meal plan for food, and, not wanting to waste money, 
        I used up all 225 of my meal swipes during my freshman fall
      
. I found that I didn’t get what I wanted out of the meal plan. Not only was it expensive, I didn’t like the food in the dining halls much or the constrained schedules telling me 
        when I could or couldn’t eat
      
. To make matters worse, I ate alone in the dining halls more often than I would’ve wanted to. I sometimes couldn’t coordinate meals with my friends because of our conflicting schedules, so if I couldn’t find somebody in the dining hall I knew well enough to eat with, I would sit alone, losing myself in the blue glow of my computer screen.

(Though, I’ve recently come to realize that I shouldn’t let my own social awkwardness get in the way of getting to know people. Asking people to eat lunch/dinner together is a really good ~friendmaking~ tactic I plan to employ more.)

That, combined with 
        Simmons’ lack of floor/wing/suite community
      
, drove me to switch into 
        MacGregor
      
 at the end of my freshman year. I felt that if I wanted to thrive in MacGregor, I would need to learn how to cook. My mom doubted my abilities to do so, offering me a meal plan and Doordash/UberEats money. However, she only strengthened my resolve. I wanted to prove her–and my own doubts–wrong, showing her that, yes, I COULD learn how to cook.

First, I had to learn the theory of cooking. It’s my personal opinion that even if you know how to cook a specific recipe, that 
        doesn’t mean you know how to cook
      
. Just being able to recall and go through the motions of a recipe doesn’t necessarily mean you know how to handle a knife, how and when to season, how to make meat the tenderest it can be. I didn’t know any of these things, so I knew I had a lot to learn.

How I currently feel when I hold a knife

As a freshman, I took advantage of my new freedom and developed an assortment of random hobbies: crochet, embroidery, drawing, etc. Simply searching for helpful tutorials on Youtube was my substitute for private lessons, and a large part of the current foundation of my skills. I figured that I could tackle cooking in a similar way. I searched up videos about cheap cooking, meal prep, and cooking as a college student, then added those videos into a playlist I could binge whenever I wanted to feel hungry.

My cooking playlist! I get so hungry when I watch this, so I think I should only watch it while I’m eating.

The next step is the practice of cooking. I decided I wouldn’t start practicing until I came to MIT, since there was no place to cook in my 
        AirBnb
      
. To make matters a little easier for myself, I signed up for a Hello Fresh subscription after finding a promo code in a Youtuber’s video, with the intent of canceling after the generous first-week discount.

Learning how to cook has gotten me excited, as I mentally plan and envision what I’m going to make next year. Whether it be traditional Chinese mapo tofu to experimental cheese waffles, no dish will be out of my reach as I attempt to become a master chef during the remainder of my MIT career. I love sampling new dishes, new methods of cooking, new ways of adding a unique kick of flavor to my food. I also want to see if I can recreate some of my favorite Armenian and Georgian dishes from this summer–
        khinkali
      
, 
        dolma
      
, and my beloved 
        lahmajo
      
. There’s a bakery next to my AirBnb, and I try to peek through the windows from the other side of the street every time I walk back from work. If I see a stack of lahmajo on the bakery counter, I cross the street and buy a lahmajo, sometimes paired with a bottle of spicy tomato juice. Now that the summer is nearing its end, the cashier’s started to remember my face and my order. “One lahmajo?” she asks, before the words can even stumble out of my mouth.

Other than my love of food, I want to learn to cook for the health benefits. This summer, I’ve been trying to health-ify my lifestyle in order to lose the weight I gained during freshman year and get back to a healthier weight. I walk to work, take full advantage of the company gym, and eat in more reasonable portions. I figured that home-cooked meals, with their more reasonable portion size, inclusion of meat and fresh greens, and lack of ultra-processing or artificial flavorings, would help me maintain a healthy weight next semester.

Yet there’s one last reason I want to cook, a reason I can’t bear to ignore. When I was very young, my grandmother still lived in the US with my parents and myself. Before the microwavable meals and the stained Chinese takeout containers, there was fried rice, fragrant meat, and lots and lots of spices. I never knew where my grandma learned to cook, where she went to school, what she did as a career. My Chinese was never good enough to communicate with her, let alone the fact that she spoke the regional dialect of her hometown. But I knew without a doubt that she loved my brother and I. I could taste it in the undertones of flavors in my meals, see it in the hours she hunched over a wok, even as walking became harder and her joints started to ache and ache with age. I still really miss all those days and all those meals. Even though, with the passing years, it all seems to blur together in my memory.

But I have a lot more good memories to make in the future. In the same way I experienced love through home-cooked meals, I want to show my friends I care about them by nourishing them–and making SURE that they enjoy that nourishment. Next semester, you can find me inviting my friends over for dinner-and-movie-nights, asking for constructive criticism on my latest cookie experiment, and trying to rope as many unsuspecting victims potential friends into my culinary endeavors.

I can’t end this post without talking about a central part of my food fixation–spice. There was another way in which my family showed their care through food, although this example is a whole less sentimental and a lot more… unique(?). When I was young, my dad tried to train me to be able to eat spicy food. I would eat rice stained with sriracha, interspersed between scoops of ice cream to ease the flames on my tongue. My dad’s logic was that, if I learned to eat spicy food, I would be able to eat spicy and non-spicy food alike. I’d say it mostly worked out. Even though I can eat both kinds of food now, I ended up strongly preferring spicy food due to my “training.” I’d constantly order the spiciest item on restaurant menus, and reach across tables to add chili sauce to my food. But I suppose this is also a cultural thing: my dad is from Hunan, a province of China known for its dry-and-spicy cuisine. When I went to China in middle school, I discovered that virtually every dish in Hunan, whether it be a main course or a humble appetizer, was spicy. 
        I was in heaven.
      
. I’m sad that my spice tolerance has decreased because of dining hall food, but I hope that these next few years can fix things back to normal. Cue the mapo tofu, hot pot, zha jiang noodles, and spicy Samyang ramen.

So, here’s to a delicious sophomore year! My hope is that I can feed myself, and all the people I’ve grown to care about here, properly. I’d be overjoyed if others like eating my food, even more so if they could handle the spice I put into my own meals. I also hope that when my mom comes over for Family Weekend, I can show her some of my new skills. I want to see the surprise on her face when she learns that, yes, I actually am cooking for myself. But I also want to see her happiness–when she tastes the hours I spent learning some classic Chinese dishes, when she realizes that I included mushrooms even though I can’t stand the texture because I know they’re her favorite food.

Oh. One last thing.

Let’s pray I don’t burn this place down.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-2.16.30-PM.png

how not to be a mathematician,Fatima A. '25,5,2024-09-15T00:00:00-04:00,"By the end of my freshman year, I was convinced that I had not learned anything in my classes at MIT. By the end of my sophomore year, the belief cemented. If anything, I felt like I had gotten less smarter than before. I felt lost and unhappy, wondering if I truly did not belong here, if I would have been better off someplace else. In classes, I thoroughly believed that I just could not learn the content deeply, no matter how hard I tried. Although for many people, MIT convinces them that nothing is impossible (and in some ways, it did that for me), for the most part in terms of math academics, I had fallen to believe something completely different. I was running away from any true interactions with math peers and professors, people I respected and admired, solely because I thought they would find out how little I know and how stupid I was and I didn’t want that to happen. 

The question of whether I wanted to do math began to nudge me more often. I wondered if I was doing it purely out of ego and stubbornness and not because I actually wanted to. I didn’t do a math UROP for the first 2.5 years of MIT, I went to office hours less often than I should’ve for my math classes, I did not participate actively in any of the math clubs, and barely made any friends in my math classes. Yes, I knew people who did math, but I knew them despite it and not because of it, and for the most part, our conversations were sanitized of math. 

I accepted the lack of belonging I felt towards the math department. I didn’t think it was a big deal; I had friends and other communities I cared about. In my head, I had divided my math vs. HASS classes, classes where I will never talk to anyone new and classes where I could have deep, meaningful conversations just as a consequence of the structure. But, taking a physics class my sophomore spring, I realized that even science classrooms don’t have to be quite as cold. There would be many people in office hours working together and although I didn’t do too well in the class, there was a sense in which I didn’t feel utterly hopeless.

Eventually, I decided to study abroad. I was going to be at Imperial, meaning that I could only take math classes. It felt like a bit of a graduate school preview in many ways and I wanted to find out whether I would like that at all. I also wanted to see what the math community looked like there, somewhere that wasn’t MIT. Overall, this experience impacted my graduate school decision positively. The more time I had to learn math, I just wanted to learn more. I knew I wasn’t done. 

I reached out to two of my old mentors, Paige B. ’24 and Pam S. ’23, both of whom have helped me with classes and who I admired a lot but never had the courage to really reach out. It turned out, they did not hate me (inconceivable). In fact, they were unbelievably kind and we chatted about math and physics and general anxiety regarding life after MIT. Frankly, the only thing that helped me be less afraid to reach out in the first place is realizing that my time at MIT is so limited and I valued the people around me a lot more than I value any perception they have of me. 

During this time, I began to strongly feel my lack of participation in the math department. Though I had complained about it far too much, I had never done anything to cause the change I had hoped to see. In hopes to remedy that and in hopes of feeling more like a part of the math department, I signed up to help with Discover Mathematics, the math pre-orientation program. 

In the summer, I went back to Chicago, where I had been for the summer after my freshman year. Two years ago, I was one of the youngest people there and the most lost. I had no algebra background (first isomorphism theorem who) and generally felt confused talking to one of my mentors. My main goal for this summer was to become slightly more fluent in my mentor’s language, that is to say, learn a little bit about the terms he uses quite often. As I went through this exercise of jumping from topic to topic, I realized how far I had come. Although some of the concepts still made little sense, I could follow a lot of what I was learning. That weird phrase people throw about, mathematical maturity, I had some of that! As the summer proceeded, I got to meet some of my friends from the REU two years ago. We had fun, socialized and talked about math. They told me about opportunities that might be interesting to me and gave me advice about graduate school. In addition to that, I derived a lot of motivation from our conversations. I began to wonder how differently things would have turned out if I had talked to more people who did math, if I had been less afraid. 

I don’t think I have a lot to show for this summer, mostly because I hopped around so many different topics I couldn’t do one in depth, but I came out feeling a lot more hopeful for the future. I learned a lot and got a lot better at reaching out to people. And, although I never felt this before, ever in my MIT career, I finally feel like I have learned stuff from my classes at MIT. I may not remember every proof and every statement, but it is easier to learn now than it used to be. Most importantly, the deep curiosity lives on. 

It is still scary to think about the future, if I will survive graduate school, but I feel more excited about how the next years unfold. I am optimistic about learning math and finding people who will support me. How bad can it be.  

It really took me three full years to even begin to feel like I could be a math undergraduate, even though that had always been my major. I had hoped to get here by the end of my freshman year but I am here now. If you are a current underclassman in the same boat as I was, feeling lost and confused and out of place, I am sending lots of hugs and care. It does get better, learning math takes time and wells of patience. Each person has their own place in math and you will find a weird niche topic you care about and a weird community that cares about that weird niche topic and suddenly, everything will not feel so scary anymore. My only advice to you would be to let yourself take that time, do not look at what others are doing, be unbearably patient with yourself, talk to many, many people, simply never be afraid, and most importantly, fuck around and find out.",,0
learning how to drive,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",6,2024-09-12T00:00:00-04:00,"STEP 1: FAIL TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

This requires some luck based on your circumstances. It’s going to be a bit harder if you live in a more suburban or rural area and local bus routes don’t pass by your house. However, if you live in a big city or within walking distance to your high school, DING DING DING! You’re in a prime position to complete the first step.

Take driver’s ed, that’s fine — it’s a rite of passage to sit in a classroom after school with a dozen other kids and watch a bunch of scary car crash videos. This will heighten your anxiety and make you even less certain about learning how to drive, especially if you don’t need to.

If you have to get around, hitch a ride with your friends who do know how to drive. Impress them on aux with your highly curated playlists, and realize on the highway that there’s a little piece of paper stuck to the windshield. Is that a ticket??? Time to panic. Oh my god is it going to fall off??? Time to panic some more. Get off the highway with the paper still secured and pull over. Realize that it’s a handwritten note:

You saved $500 today. You’re welcome for not being towed for blocking my driveway. Buy your friends a drink w/ your savings.

You saved $500 today. You’re welcome for not being towed for blocking my driveway. Buy your friends a drink w/ your savings.



Have your friends drop you off at your home at the end of the night, but don’t get out of the car immediately. Instead, drive around your block slowly while you talk about being sixteen-seventeen-eighteen, confused and hopelessly romantic and angry at the world. Cherish these nights while you still have them.

 

STEP 2: FAIL TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE IN COLLEGE.

This is a little easier than step one, because if you didn’t learn how to drive in high school, you’re probably not going to learn how to drive in college. That’s okay. It’s likely that the public transport around your college is pretty good, especially if you go to MIT.

React with some alarm when you hear that you have to submit an ID photo, because you’ve just graduated high school and you’re still shy about pictures of yourself. Spend half an hour in the backyard trying to take a head-on selfie in direct sunlight because it’s 2020 and golden hour selfies have been all over Instagram these past couple of years. End up with a result you’re mostly okay with except for the fact that you’re squinting because you were staring into the sun. That’s okay. Blink away the sunspots and manually edit the picture to have a white background. Now it looks like a passport photo.

Obtain an MIT ID upon landing at freshman orientation with that awkward photo printed on it, and be told by very nice people that it also serves as a public transit card — a CharlieCard. You catch glimpses of other people’s ID photos and realize that 1) it was fine to submit a picture that wasn’t strictly front-facing, you could have had your head at a 3/4 angle, and 2) it didn’t even need a white background.

You will now spend four years swiping your CharlieCard in and out of MBTA stations. Visit New York City and be impressed by their credit card tap systems, and wish for that to happen in Boston so that you’re not screwed if your card isn’t charged and the entrance you went through doesn’t have a fare machine. Your wish will be granted eventually.

You’ll turn 21 and realize you don’t have a license for getting into 21+ spaces, only your passport, which you bring along a couple times before everyone convinces you that it’s a BAD IDEA. So you apply for a Massachusetts resident ID card instead. Even if you spend a lot of time doing your makeup, you will somehow end up with a half-frowning expression on your ID photo. That’s okay. At least you won’t lose the ability to travel to other countries at bars now.

Your mother will likely nag you to learn how to drive the summer between your junior and senior years, but you will not do anything about it. You just joined a research lab where almost no one drives, or they just learned how to drive very recently — including the PI. This makes sense in your head because it is a marine ecology lab.

Talk to one of your supervisors and hear that she’s learning how to drive from a driving school in Boston. You ask about which school it is, and try to get in contact to schedule lessons, but you’re told that you need to get your learner’s permit first. You’ll register for an appointment at the RMV to take the permit test, but forget to study for it because you were so immersed in your research, and figure that you’ll learn how to drive some other time.

 

STEP 3: REALIZE THAT DRIVING IS PROBABLY A GOOD SKILL TO HAVE.

A year will go by, and you’ll get a crazy idea to do a cross-country road trip the summer after graduation. Tell everyone about this, but also, you don’t know how to drive, and chances are, that’s an important part of going on a road trip.

It’s time to lock in. Register for another appointment at the RMV. Study the Massachusetts driver’s manual furiously. Graduate. Give your final research presentation to your group and cry because you loved everyone in your lab so much.

Take your permit test a couple days after graduation and shock the RMV worker because you went into the testing room and came back less than five minutes later. Receive your paper permit and call up a local driving school, but you will quickly realize that it’s summer and the population of people wanting to take driving lessons includes you and all the high schoolers in the area. Schedule your lessons a month out and decide that maybe you’ll fly for most of for your trip instead.

Your lab supervisors give you a copy of the Mechanic Shop Femme’s Guide to Car Ownership as a graduation gift. You cry a little more.



 

STEP 4: GET BEHIND THE WHEEL AND DON’T CRASH.

It’s July. It’s the day of your first driving lesson. It’s raining. On the way to where you’ll be picked up, you watch a motorcyclist slide and crash into the curb at a stoplight. People check on him and he’s fine, he gets up and drives away, but you wonder if that’s a bad omen.

Arrive at the pickup location. You will probably end up on the wrong side of the street at first. That’s okay. You’ll spot the car with the giant STUDENT DRIVER sign on top eventually. Emanate nervous energy when you get into the car, but listen attentively when the very nice and patient driving instructor tells you all the things you need to do. Shift gears and press the gas pedal (nice and easy) and…you’re driving. You’re going to be so intensely focused on trying to pay attention to everything that you won’t notice how tightly you’re gripping the steering wheel until you get to a red light and your entire body sags a bit when you finally let yourself breathe.

Leave that first lesson a little more confident in yourself, and very grateful to your instructor.

It’s the day of your second driving lesson. You get in the car, still nervous, but you think you understand the basics now. It’s a different instructor this time, and he doesn’t say much, but he seems a little annoyed at you. You’re being kind of slow while you make sure everything’s in order.

“DRIVE!”

You drive. You make a lot of mistakes, which your instructor does not hesitate to point out. You tear up a little as you wind through residential routes but you don’t want to seem weak. You leave feeling kind of deflated. Maybe it was beginner’s luck on the first day?

It’s the day of your third driving lesson. It’s the instructor from yesterday. You’re a little wary when you get in the car, but you know what to do now, and you’re making fewer mistakes, and you’re even cracking a few jokes. By the end of it, you think you’ve won him over.

More lessons fly past, and eventually, it’s time to take your road test. It is at 9 AM. You have an international flight later that evening. It’s now or never.

It’s raining again, just like the first day. You line up next to a group of other people and wait. You chat with the high school kid in front of you for a little bit, and then it’s your turn. You think you’re doing pretty good, until you almost forget to put the car in park when you’re asked what to do when you park downhill with a curb because your brain goes blank, but you remember at the last minute. When you circle back to the starting point, the examiner is so expressionless that you’re not even sure if you passed or not, but you see the cursive letters on your permit.

You get on the Green Line to head home and you are SO HAPPY.

 

STEP 5: BECOME A LICENSE-CARRYING MEMBER OF SOCIETY.

You get back from your trip and your shiny new driver’s license is in the mail. Unfortunately, it’s the same half-frowning photo as your Massachusetts ID, but it’s fine. You’ll have the chance to retake it eventually…right?

Summer ends and it’s time to start your MEng. You feel so old now. The halls feel different — they’re alive with an energy that no longer belongs to you. A new chapter in the institutional memory book.

You’ll probably want to print a new MIT ID because your old one is pretty beat up and it doesn’t really look like you anymore. You uploaded a new picture a while ago, so it’s all updated in Atlas. You go to a printing station in Stata and wait a couple minutes for it to print.

…

…

You do a double take.

IT LOOKS SO DIFFERENT.

oh how times have changed

There’s no longer a holographic MIT logo flashing on your card. Instead, it’s a simple flat white background. And it’s RED now, because you’re no longer an undergrad.

(Your friend says you’re looking more and more like your cat Coffee.)

coffee giving me major side eye

Things have changed so much, and you’re still reeling from everything that’s happened — everyone you’ve met, every class you’ve taken, every experiment you’ve done. The dust is just now settling from the whirlwind of graduation, and so many of your friends are scattered all over the country.

You miss the way things were. But you’ve come so far.

And now you know how to drive.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3404-scaled-e1726186492602-1000x915.jpg

From First Visit to First Week,Richard O. '28,2,2024-09-12T00:00:00-04:00,"Last week I started classes at MIT. A simple 7-part sentence that would’ve meant the world to freshman me back in high school. But as I prepare for my 4-year journey that will probably include a lot of late nights and interesting experiences, I want to reflect a little on my first trip to this campus which I think really changed the way I’ve viewed my preparedness for this next stage of my life. More specifically, the independence that came from visiting MIT the first time.

 

Looking back, there’s something about traveling that I think can be fulfilling and scary at the same time – especially traveling alone. On one hand, I think it’s really cool that in today’s world, you can press a few buttons on a screen, and in a few months a large cylinder with wings can take you halfway across the east coast to a state you’ve never set foot in. But on the other hand, traveling alone is also an experience that I think can change the way you see yourself – at least it did for me. 

 

Probably like most of my peers, I don’t live near Cambridge. And the last time I was on a plane was when my family went to Ghana back in 2017. So visiting MIT last April for the first time for 
         CPW 
      
 was something completely new to me – not just because I had never been on the campus before but also because I don’t travel that much. And this time, I was traveling by myself. No parents. No Siblings. No friends. Just a backpack, a carry-on suitcase, and a newly purchased MIT sweatshirt that I probably wore to school a few too many times prior. 

IAD airport at 6 AM which I hadn’t seen for 7 years until my trip to MIT

 

But I very vividly remember the moment I said bye to my dad at the airport after he helped me check my ticket before leaving. In that moment as I was waving and watching him walk back towards the entrance after dropping me off, I began to realize that I was really on my own – not just in the fact that I was flying by myself, but more importantly in the fact that I had reached a point in my life where I truly had a sense of autonomy in my life decisions. Neither of my parents had made me go on this trip. The flight had no credit requirement that would show up on my high school transcript or worksheet that had to be submitted for a grade. Applying to MIT wasn’t even an expected activity for a club or anything like that. The whole thing was the culmination of decisions I made about my life – for myself. And that for me was…different. I was so used to living with frameworks and expectations from school and the people around me that the realization of me having this much responsibility over my life decisions was a weird thing that hung in my mind the whole time I waited for my flight.

But after the short 90-minute trip (filled with regret after finding out that cellular plans don’t actually work on planes and I should’ve downloaded my music playlists before taking off) I realized that this independence, as weird as it was, could also be empowering. In the next 3.14 days, I had the chance to meet people who came from all over the world (literally) and were amazing in their own way – some of which were people I had met on Instagram and it was really great to finally meet them in person.

Some photos with said amazing people:

 

But looking back I now notice that it’s okay to feel lost and alone sometimes. It’s okay to feel nervous about being independent and making decisions. Because at the end of the day, you aren’t alone. Yes, I took a flight by myself to somewhere completely new in the middle of exam reviews. But I wasn’t the only one experiencing this – I was among 1,000+ other students also leaving their homes to come somewhere that may have been completely foreign to some of them – and that’s okay. Because making these decisions is what life is all about – regardless of whether or not things go the way you plan. 

 

And just like the several thousand people here on campus as well as the millions of students on other college campuses have found their way up to the start of classes for this semester, I’ve somehow managed to navigate my own journey up to where I am now and hope that as I continue through MIT I’ll be able to embrace this independence and learn more about myself and what I want to do and be after college. 

 

Because after all, thanks to this independence, I got to experience MIT and all its unique aspects from its underground tunnels to its famous Great Dome…by myself, in the middle of Cambridge, almost 500 miles away from home.

a year of counting fish,Kai V. '25,9,2024-09-11T00:00:00-04:00,"When I was a freshman I joined a plasma physics lab. Plasma physics is beautiful stuff, magnetic flux tubes and reconnection and turbulence, which I came to appreciate over the two years that I did this research. But I first became interested because if you figure out those beautiful things, then you can write down equations to plug into a simulation, and that simulation can give you a better idea of how plasma behaves in a fusion reactor. Then, of course, you build the perfect fusion reactor and you save the world.

That isn’t how it turned out, though. I started the project—and college—thinking there were just a few big problems in the world, and I would pick one and work on it. With the endless opportunities and resources that MIT promised, I was excited to start doing “real work”, and the straightforward pipeline from equations to simulations to nuclear fusion seemed as real as anything I knew at that time.

Two years later I felt pulled apart in every direction. I quit the plasma physics research: to get any good at theoretical plasma physics you have to know a lot of things that I didn’t, or else be willing to put in time that I didn’t. And we’re a long way off from fusion power, even farther from commercial-scale fusion. The remaining challenges mostly lie in engineering, not esoteric plasma physics phenomena. 


Nothing else I tried was any better. Twiddling with dimensions in SolidWorks for engineering teams felt even bleaker than reading opaque plasma physics papers. One policy class and then another showed me that I liked learning about policy, but politics felt depressing and unproductive. The more I explored, the more the very notion of “real work” became confused. In clubs I designed machines and built things with my hands, but then I ached for the process of research, of venturing into the unknown. In math and physics classes I made pretty discoveries about functional analysis and quantum mechanics in my psets, but then I felt a resistance to truly hunkering down and getting good at it, as if I was holding out for a better goal.

In my mind theory and impact existed on two sides of an impenetrable divide, what had once been a hairline crack before college but which now yawned wider by the day. In every field I turned to, the same question reared its head: in industry, how do you incorporate scientific discoveries into your work? Or in academia, how do you make sure your research will eventually benefit people? How does anyone ever get anything done?

When I asked the adults I knew who were scientists and engineers and policymakers, they all said that’s a really good question! and not one of them answered it. Would I not find, at MIT, a single anecdote from a single person who felt deep down that they could do not only good work, but real work for the world?


It’s been a bit over a year since that spring. Now, I have an anecdote.

By a strange twist of fate, in my junior year I found myself working on a project to count salmon. Here’s the idea. Salmon spawn in rivers and swim out to the ocean to spend their adult lives before returning to their home rivers to spawn the next generation of salmon. This is really important to the ecosystems surrounding their home rivers: spawning salmon provide food, and their bodies fertilize the rivers when they die. But their populations have waned with habitat loss and warming waters.

also they look like this when they spawn which is a lot freakier than how they usually look

 

To see if a certain conservation measure (like taking down a dam, or releasing juvenile salmon into the wild) is working, we need an accurate method for measuring population. Currently people put sonar cameras in rivers and count the number of salmon swimming upstream or downstream when they return to spawn. This is very time- and labor-intensive, and it costs a lot to hire the technicians who do this counting, meaning that only a few rivers employ this sonar technology. Six years ago, some scientists including my PI asked, what if we apply computer vision to this problem? That’s the project I joined.

I thought a computer vision lab would focus on theoretical ML, but in fact, most of the work looks like this: given a problem, what data do you need to solve it, and how do you construct that dataset? How do you account for—a big problem in ecology—long-tailed distributions, where many classes of interest are sighted rarely, where 40% of your dataset is gazelles and 40% is zebras and the other 20% are a gazillion other species you want to identify correctly? How do you take a model which works well on data from one domain and develop some way of preprocessing or fine-tuning or unsupervised learning to help generalize the model to a new domain?

In group meetings for this salmon project we get even more concrete. Four dams are being removed on a big river this fall and they want to use our model to help count fish populations, before and after. Each Zoom call is a frenzy of discussion: we could give them our model as a web tool, but cloud GPU time is expensive; we could send it to them packaged in a Jetson (a little Linux box with NVIDIA GPUs), but it would be difficult to debug if anything went wrong during, say, a software update; we could buy them iPads and have them download an app, but then we’re getting into iOS app development. “Maybe Apple would sponsor us,” one professor muses. “They could have this slogan, ‘Apple saves the fish!’”

They’re not being facetious; iOS app development isn’t outside of the realm of possibility! My grad students are thinking of building a raytracer to generate synthetic fish data and modifying open-source annotation software. They build web apps to display multimodal data in sync, to query our database and collect clips more easily. I thought I might feel out of place as a physics and math student who, at the start of the project, had only used programming for plasma physics research before and barely knew what a class was—but everyone in the lab was picking up skills on the fly to cobble together applications, and I was no exception.

At the end of June, I flew to Seattle for a conference our group had organized. The idea was to aggregate all the people who were involved in this salmon counting project—my mentors at MIT, the other half of the group at Caltech, and for the first time, the people actually sitting watching the sonar video feed while fish swam by.

In the conference hall, we set up our model on a desktop and tested it on people’s hard drives of sonar clips. One guy had sorted his clips into Easy, Medium, and Hard. Our model failed miserably on the Hard ones, somehow predicting over a thousand fish swimming by because the water was so turbid that the same twenty fish kept flashing in and out.

My head felt fuzzy—my flight had been delayed by 12 hours overnight, and in the end I got just three hours of sleep—so I drifted out of conversations to refill my paper cup with coffee, conversations with an eclectic mix of ecologists and computer scientists, a short girl with dark hair and sure eyes who simulated fish populations in rivers, a tall skinny guy who’d pulled our code from GitHub and run it beforehand and was waving around a see-through red water bottle with an I Love Fish! sticker on it, a stocky man in a baseball cap who complained about how the NOAA wouldn’t fund the digitization of the decades of salmon counts they had yellowing in drawers.

The next morning we drove to a nearby river and stooped over inside an RV to watch sonar clips of fish swimming by while technicians explained how they found these clips in the video feed. In one clip, a beaver swam by and caught a fish, its great shadow bulging over the conical surface of the sonar field of view.

I could go on and on about how beautiful and green everything was and how the whole place felt alive and how everyone cared about it being alive. The more people I met in Seattle who were deeply invested in the wellbeing of the river and ocean ecosystems, the less I cared for my previous standards for “real work”.

Because there is care and beauty and impact in all different kinds of work. As a freshman wholly unused to the problems I’d encounter in the real world, my mistake had been to conflate “real” work with physical, engineering-type work, neatly quantified as increases in efficiency or quality of life; then, as a sophomore affected by the intellectual prestige climb, I conflated “real” work with whichever type of work felt hardest and most technical. But you can feel dissatisfied whether you’re building a solar farm or reading math papers. What matters is finding something to bridge the crevasse you can’t help but see.

Just like other people can’t help but want to code or make music or, I guess, think about topology, there’s this gaping chasm between theory and impact that I know I would be sneaking desperate glances at for years if I don’t try to bridge it now. In Seattle I peered into the chasm once more and, for the first time, caught a glimpse of the bottom. Learning from different people, collaborating with my mentors, driving a project from start to finish to the hands of people who will use its results—to me that’s the real work: real not as in physical or technical or even legitimate, but as in the work that makes my life feel richer for each moment I spend on it.

It felt fitting that my first-ever visit to Seattle was in the context of this salmon project. Wherever we walked, salmon iconography appeared in sculpted totem poles and colorful shop faces. By the time I left my heart felt very full. My mentor and another PhD student waved us goodbye as I stepped into the bus back to the airport with a member of my group who was flying out that night. “I’m glad you’ll be working here full-time this summer,” he said, sitting next to me. The air outside filled with orange as the sun sank below the skyline. “There is so much for us to do.”",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BIGSALMON-1-400x210.jpeg,1

[joint post] a guide to mit gyms,Gloria Z. '26,10,2024-09-04T00:00:00-04:00,"intro

Gloria: Contrary to popular belief, MIT students actually do exercise! We lift, run, dance and generally touch grass. One feature of MIT student life is that every dorm comes equipped with its own gym, which residents can tap into 24/7. Since the 
        Zesiger Center
      
 and 
        Wang Fitness Center
      
 have limited hours, those looking to squeeze in a quick 2AM lift often turn to their in-building fitness facilities instead. Each dorm gym has its own pros, cons, and personal quirks, and there’s something there to suit any and every workout routine. We’ve visited and lifted in (almost) all of them and chronicled/tier-listed them below for your convenience :).

Kano: Boston is an active city, and the gyms reflect it. Students get complimentary access to campus gyms, so it’s easier to take part. In addition to the confinement of hours like Gloria noted, campus gyms can also get quite busy. As someone who has worked the front desk for them, I’ve seen that space can be limited. So, dorm gyms come quite in handy!

the tier list 

we are not taking feedback

institute gyms

We didn’t write detailed reviews of the institute gyms because they are just objectively the best. They have the most equipment, are thoroughly cleaned daily, and are huge. 

Z Center

Located in west campus, where most student dorms are, so the Z’s facilities are by far the most used.

Wang Fitness Center

Located in 
        east campus,
      
 attached to Stata, so very convenient for those living in 
        East Campus
      
 and grad housing.

 

dorm gyms

Burton-Conner

the Equinox of MIT dorm gyms

GOOD: The BC gym is new and clean (post-remodel!), with everything you could want for your workout: three squat racks, an assisted pull up machine, a cable station, various leg and arm machines, and a good amount of cardio equipment (treadmills, erging machines, bike). It also has a large dance/yoga room attached, with wraparound mirrors.

LESS GOOD: If we have to nitpick, the gym doesn’t have mirrors in front of the squat racks, which could be useful for checking form.

pretty spacious :)

S: New House

small but mighty

GOOD: The New House gym is smaller in surface area but highly functional. It has one rack, some benches and free weights, a cable station, and some miscellaneous other machines and cardio equipment. It also has a speaker system you can connect your phone to to blast your music overhead, and a water fountain with nice cold water.

LESS GOOD: There isn’t a huge variety of targeted machines, so this gym is better suited for free weight workouts. Because of the small surface area, it feels quite full when more than 3 or 4 people are using it at a time. And–the gym has floor-to-ceiling windows facing the street down dorm row, meaning everyone walking by has a crystal-clear view into it at night.

look at that comforting burgundy flooring

A: MacGregor

channeling dungeon chic

GOOD: This is one of the largest dorm gyms in terms of pure surface area. It comes equipped with a rack, plenty of free weights, and various machines.

CONS: As the subtitle suggests, the gym is a little… scrappy in terms of its equipment. Not all of the plates match, and many of them are the raw metal kind, not the rubber-coated ones. But this isn’t necessarily a con–I feel like the gym’s vibes are very conducive to locking in and pretending that you’re battling demons in order to get a better pump.

this pic really captures the vibes

A: 
        Simmons
      


two glorious floors, many windows

GOOD: The Simmons gym has the essentials. It’s split across 2 floors: bottom for cardio and top for weightlifting, connected via a metal spiral staircase. For cardio, there are 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, and 3 stationary bikes. For weightlifting, there are 2 power cages, 1 cable station, 1 bench press, and an array of dumbbells. There are miscellaneous items like a punching bag, bosu ball, and foam roller. The windows tie the gym together well because you always get bright, natural lighting, unlike most dorms that have theirs located in the basement. 

LESS GOOD: It’s located on the 8th and 9th floors, so it can only be used in certain hours due to noise to nearby rooms. Additionally, the high floor makes it so that we can’t drop weights. There are no targeted machines, so weightlifting focus here is mostly on free weights. 

B: New Vassar

neat and clean

GOOD: This gym is clean, has pretty nice and new equipment, and has a water fountain inside. It also has huge windows and nice natural light.

LESS GOOD: The dorm is not that big and could definitely use some more machines. It also faces right onto the road, so you can make eye contact with everyone walking past.

B: McCormick

a tiny baby in the sky

GOOD: The view is AWESOME, perhaps the best, because it is on the rooftop. You get a panoramic view of the city, with, of course, great lighting. It’s mostly cardio and has some light weights: ellipticals, stationary bikes, treadmills, yoga balls, and some weights. 

LESS GOOD: Because it is on the top floor, the gym doesn’t have a power rack or any other “heavy” forms of lifting equipment. The location also make it such that it can get really loud on windy days.

this view at sunset 😍

C: Next House

new house if it was aged like 5 years

GOOD: The Next House gym has a pretty good suite of equipment, including a couple benches, a rack, and some machines. It’s also got one of those climbing grip training boards, which is kinda fun, and enough mirrors.

LESS GOOD: This gym is pretty small, so everything’s quite close together. It also feels a little musty, though maybe that’s just me (Gloria).

C: Baker House

modest brick gym

GOOD: It has great upper lighting. There are a few essential machines: treadmills, ellipticals, stairmaster, calf press, cable machines, and an array of dumbbells. 

LESS GOOD: It’s small and cramped. While it has several good machines, the lack of space makes it hard to do much beyond them. 

D: 
        East Campus
      


channeling dungeon grunge (grungeon)

GOOD: If you’re looking for a dystopia survivor-core gym, this is it. Located in the basement, filled with old pipes and loose weights, this gym elicits a particular “bunker” vibe. It’s under renovation right now, so I (Kano) can only tell you what I recall: there’s a calf press machine, power rack, leg press machine, bench press, stationary bike, and an array of dumbbells. 

LESS GOOD: There isn’t much stuff. The gym musty, rusty smell is real. The pipes were also low, so I couldn’t do jumping exercises without hitting them or standing in particular sections of the room (ex. jumping jacks). Feels like a sauna—not much ventilation. 

D: Maseeh

technically a gym

GOOD: The Maseeh gym is almost always empty, so you can sit on your phone as long as you want between sets without feeling embarrassed.

LESS GOOD: This gym is equipped with exactly one rack, one bench, and one set of free weights, along with a few cardio machines. It’s also located right next to the ping pong and pool tables, so sometimes your workout or run is punctuated by the click and conversation of gameplay.

live love basement gym

E: Random

four pieces of equipment

GOOD: The gym is set up with free weights, a weight machine, a treadmill, and an exercise bike. There’s also a mini trampoline! So, two weightlifting machines and two cardio machines. This gym meets the bare minimum, but it at least meets it.

LESS GOOD: It is very small and crowded. Good for when you want to work out in the dorm in a jiffy, but worth going out to larger, campus gyms if you’re looking for more specialty equipment. 

last and unfortunately least

our gym preferences

Gloria: As for our personal gym preferences, my top choice is almost always the Z. I really like having a slew of specialized machines to choose from, and I like working out in an environment with lots of other people focused on their own lifts. I find that when I work out in more secluded environments (like the Maseeh gym), it’s so easy to just sit on my phone or get distracted; being around others in a dedicated gym vibe keeps me locked in. The Z is also extremely close to Maseeh, where I live (it’s literally a straight line across the field). The one downside is that it can get extremely crowded at peak hours, so I generally try to go either between 10AM-1PM or from 10-11PM. If the Z is closed, I’ll either ask one of my BC friends to tap me into their gym or make do with what we have in Maseeh.

In the summer after my freshman year, however, I was working a UROP at the Media Lab, so I mainly used the nearby Wang Fitness Center instead. Since it was summer, it was mainly populated by grad students, and I did enjoy that the Wang center had a really large and generally empty dance/yoga room, where I could stretch or (attempt to) do calisthenics.

Kano: My gym location has depended on where I’ve lived. Though my routine has remained pretty constant: I prefer to go in the mornings, like 7-8am, because the machines are always available, and it’s harder for me to make excuses to not go. At night, when caught up with problem sets or projects or something, I found myself deprioritizing my workouts. I guess it also helps that I’m more of a morning person. I also get an energy burst after gym time, so it’s nice to start off rather than end my day with that. I lift most days. But, if I really didn’t feel like thinking about my workout, then I would let myself do a 30 min run instead.

For a few years, I did power rack and cardio stuff, so most gyms were fine for me. In freshman and sophomore year, I lived at East Campus, so I defaulted to the Wang Fitness Center and used the dorm gym when I was in a time crunch or when we were snowed in. During summer after freshman year, I lived at pika and frequented the Z by biking over. In junior year, I lived at Simmons and defaulted to the dorm gym. 

These days, I’m using more targeted machines, so I’ll be headed to the institute gyms more often. I’m still at Simmons for my senior year, so I’ll continue using the dorm gym with some visits to the Z/Wang for specialty machines, as needed.

What I’m taking this semester!,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",2,2024-09-04T00:00:00-04:00,"Classes start tomorrow! today! I started writing this at 11:55PM and now it’s 12:45AM.

I haven’t done a “what am I taking this semester” post in a while, because I think I jinxed sophomore fall last time. I shudder every time I look back on 
        6.3700.
      
 Although 
        6.1200
      
 was fun! But I digress.

This is the first upcoming semester that I haven’t felt so apprehensive about. It’s mostly because I have a lot more freedom to choose what classes I want to take now that I’m close to finishing my major (which is surreal), but it’s also a mindset change that’s come with becoming a senior, I think. I haven’t necessarily become “smarter”, I’ve just become used to working on assignments for longer periods of time. I’ve also grown an “idgaf if you think I’m stupid, I’m just here to learn” vibe to cope with imposter syndrome, and that’s generally improved my state of mind.

And honestly, there isn’t a single class that I’m not looking forward to! Which is also a first for me. There was always at least one class that I was reluctant to take.

Overview

- Robotic Manipulation [6.4210]

- Computational Cognitive Science [6.4120]

- Digital and Computational Photography [6.8371]

- Art of Comic Book Writing [21W.744]

- Intro to Film Studies [21L.011]

- Archery, for the first quarter of the semester

Robotic Manipulation [6.4210]

CI-M 
        (Communication Intensive in Major)
      


Introduces the fundamental algorithmic approaches for creating robot systems that can autonomously manipulate physical objects in unstructured environments such as homes and restaurants.

Introduces the fundamental algorithmic approaches for creating robot systems that can autonomously manipulate physical objects in unstructured environments such as homes and restaurants.

I have to take one more CI-M, and I’ve really wanted to take a robotics class. Robotics team was one of my favorite parts of high school, and robotics is the main reason why I ever got interested in AI in the first place. I’ll be lying if I say I’m not a little apprehensive, but I don’t have anything else to say other than that I’m quite excited for this class.

Plus, I could end up becoming a cool super villain or something.

Computational Cognitive Science [6.4120]

EECS elective

Introduction to computational theories of human cognition. Focus on principles of inductive learning and inference, and the representation of knowledge.

Introduction to computational theories of human cognition. Focus on principles of inductive learning and inference, and the representation of knowledge.

I picked this class on the basis of “I have no idea what this is going to look like but it sounds dope” + good class rating.

There’s an alternate universe out there where I kept following my 6th grade interests and majored in brain stuff instead. Think about it, I’m writing this blog post because a meat blob full of electricity and chemicals is telling me to do it. That’s neat. Since the class is going into probabilistic and statistical modeling, I won’t be straying too far from what I’ve already learned.

Digital and Computational Photography [6.8371]

AI+D_AUS (Advanced Undergraduate Subjects in AI + Decision Making)

Presents fundamentals and applications of hardware and software techniques used in digital and computational photography, with an emphasis on software methods. Provides sufficient background to implement solutions to photographic challenges and opportunities.

I’m going to be honest, I just picked this class because its rating was really good. The more I think about it though, the more I’m looking forward to it.

I begrudgingly took Advances in Computer Vision [6.8301] last spring because I had to complete a CI-M by the end of junior year. Despite the issues that came from the unprecedented number of students who enrolled in the course, I ended up liking CV so much that I’m considering it as a possible field to delve into. 6.8371 is going to be a neat addition to that knowledge.

Art of Comic Book Writing [21W.744]


        HASS
      


Students create short scripts and full-length comic book narratives across a variety of genres, while analyzing a wide range of comics (corporate and independent, print and web).

I’M SO SO SO SO SO EXCITED. I’ve wanted to publish a comic longer than I’ve wanted to do anything science and engineering-related, but I’d intimidate myself out of it every time. The longest comic I’ve worked on is this Harvard x MIT fanfic my friends and I made in freshman year, but I would like to create things that won’t get me sued by the Ivy League.

I had no idea 21W.744 was even offered this fall until a friend told me that she was taking it. Since it’s a limited enrollment class and I didn’t pre-register for it, I was nervous that I wasn’t going to get in, but I did!

Intro to Film Studies [21L.011]

HASS 
        (CI-H)
      


Concentrates on close analysis and criticism of a wide range of films, including works from the early silent period, documentary and avant-garde films, European art cinema, and contemporary Hollywood fare.

I’m taking a second HASS to nurture my arts-loving soul. 1/4 of my YouTube recommendations are video essays made by film students, and there was a period in elementary school where I thought I wanted to become a movie director. We also get to watch a movie every Monday night!

Although, this is probably the class that I’ll drop if the semester gets too hectic. Every CI-H is built different, but they typically involve a good amount of writing. I have no problem writing essays, but they can be a time sink.

Archery

I put off my last PE requirement to senior year, but I decided to get that out of the way. I used to do archery back in middle school, so this is a fun throwback.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screen-Shot-2024-09-04-at-12.22.08-AM-800x847.png,1
4 comfort songs for your first day,Kanokwan T. '26,0,2024-09-03T00:00:00-04:00,"The first day of classes is tomorrow. 
        I can’t believe it.
      


The past few days have been the shortest window I’ve ever had between the end of my summer commitments and the start of the school year, so I’ve been very precious with preserving my energy. Even then, I’m not particularly stressed about day 1 of my senior year.

I was, however, feeling lots of emotions for day 1 of my freshman year. Thoughts ran like mad in my head. Nerves tightened. I couldn’t quite get myself to bed.

The first day of anything can always feel a bit stressful—but that must accompany excitement.

When I’m wrapped up in feelings, I turn to two things: silence and song.

Moments of laying down on my bed, looking at the ceiling, breathing in and out.

Moments of sitting reclined in my rolling chair, talking with myself to work through some thoughts.

Moments of dilly dallying on my phone while songs flood the space.

Moments of dancing alone in my room to some tunes.

Here are 4 songs for you, with some of my favorite lyric excepts:

Back To Life by Soul II Soul & Caron Wheeler

tbh i mostly listen to this one for the sound and general vibe than the lyrics

Back to life, back to reality [..] Back to the here and now

Preseason Kickoff

Preseason for fall sports is a span of two weeks in the summer before the semester starts, where women’s and men’s soccer, football, women’s volleyball, cross country, field hockey, and all the other fall sports come back to campus to prepare for the fall season. This period of time is when the hyphenated word of student-athlete flips and you become the mystical other thing: an athlete-student. No school – just a soccer practice at 8 am and another at 2 pm, mid-day naps, ice baths, and hanging out with all your friends you’ve been missing over the summer. 

We had a team meeting to kickoff the start of preseason. Here are two of our sophomores with our team’s mascot: Hood Beav. He’s about 15 years old and has been passed on to an energetic freshman each year to lead the team in spirit. Yours truly was the bearer of Hood Beav freshman year :)

Meet the 2024 Women’s Soccer Team!

2. Team Bonding

Women’s Soccer Bonding

We have 34 people on the team this year, so preseason is the time to get to know each other better.

3. Friendly Scrimmages + Our Home Opener

Harvard

Our third day of preseason we scrimmaged Harvard! As some of you may recall, this same scrimmage last year is when I got into a tackle that broke my foot and ended my junior season. But don’t worry – I emerged from this scrimmage healthy and with all bones intact! In fact, our team actually did pretty well, with a loss of only 1-2. Harvard ended last season ranked 17th in D1, so I was really proud of how our team competed against one of the top D1 teams in the nation!

Southern New Hampshire University

We also played a scrimmage against a D2 team called Southern New Hampshire University. We won this game 5-2, and it gave the team some solid confidence for the start of the season.

Gordon College: Home Opener!!

We had our very first game of the season on our home field! I’ll let the pics show you how it went, but let’s just say we started the season off with a bang :)

4. Boston :)

I am so so so happy to be back in Boston, where I get to explore with my friends and get to witness a glorious sunset over the Charles River every night. Over the past three years, Boston has nestled its way into my heart and joined one of the many places I now call home.

This preseason was awesome – I’m so grateful to finally be healthy again and to be playing soccer with my teammates. Shoutout to the women’s soccer team, and as always, ROLL TECH!!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC00243-400x267.jpg

Painting by number,David duKor-Jackson,0,2024-09-02T00:00:00-04:00,"image generated by pbnify.com

In a rant post many years ago, I referenced the concept of students completing elaborate “paint by number” applications that could often be appealing at first glance, but ultimately turn out to be woefully short on substance.  I want to revisit and elaborate on that notion because it remains apropos today as students continue to seek ways to unlock the secret formula to secure admission.

For starters, I can not argue with the logic of trying to discover the formula for admission, (even though there isn’t one).  This is MIT after all.  We love formulas.  When you combine the idea of creating an image based upon numbers, surely this is kismet.  Because the only thing we love more than formulas is numbers, or at least that is what people think.

There are actually quite a lot of things that we love.  We love learning.  We love solving hard problems.  We love to collaborate.  We love to express ourselves creatively, and perhaps most importantly, we love to do all of these things, and many more, simultaneously.

As such, the very idea that one can somehow orchestrate and compile a specific sequence of events, activities and accolades that will guarantee admission is completely antithetical to everything that we are about.

Let me go back to the concept of painting by number.  While the finished product could resemble a masterpiece, generally the best that it can aspire to be is a convincing counterfeit, which is typically not what we are going for when selecting students for our class.  It is also worth noting that many may take inspiration from the same idealized portrait of excellence, which frequently delivers a collection of submissions that are virtually indistinguishable from one another.  In those situations, a new interpretation, spawned either by creative license or necessity, given the available resources, may stand out from the crowd.

I know that this is difficult to reconcile for many students (and their parents) who have carefully curated portfolios designed to impress.  On the surface, they have done everything “right,” but the “how” and “why” are just as important as the “what.”  So when the fundamental response to “how” is that it was facilitated by parents and their connections rather than through individual initiative on the part of the student, or the “why” is because it will look good rather than because students are pursuing an area of genuine interest, the “what,” regardless of how impressive it may seem, loses a lot of its luster.

Institutionally, we aspire to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind, working with others to bring knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges. None of that is achievable by simply following a path that has been blazed by others. It is essential, therefore, that students who aspire to be the creators and innovators of tomorrow engage in pursuits today that lay the groundwork for the challenges ahead. 

A few things that I would suggest:

- Learn to prioritize and balance. YOU CAN NOT DO EVERYTHING! So you should not try to. If you have trouble figuring out what you should do…

- Pursue areas of genuine interest (or dare I say, passion). If there is not anything that you are genuinely interested in, then you probably need to keep looking. Try new things. Keep investigating and exploring until you find something meaningful to you. And finally…

- Achieve more than is expected of you.  Do what is achievable, rather than what is simply sufficient.  Don’t limit yourself by asking what do I need to do (which can also be read “what is the minimum that I need to do”) in order to earn this grade or gain admission?  Do what you are capable of.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PBN-Dome-400x225.png,1
Pre-Sophomore Year,Jessica Z. '27,1,2024-09-01T00:00:00-04:00,"Today was my first full day back on campus! This summer was a whirlwind of finishing finals, flying to DC, driving home to Pennsylvania, visiting family in Delaware and New York, and traveling to Cape Cod with some MIT friends before officially arriving back to my very-not-unpacked dorm room. We had a fire alarm go off in
        BC
      
this afternoon, and it truly felt like home <3

Despite the bulk of my traveling for this summer being done, I haven’t quite settled in yet. In fact, as I’m typing this now, I should be packing for my Chicago flight that leaves in a few hours. Instead, though, I’ve spent the past few hours thinking about this upcoming year.

It feels brighter on campus with a
        new class year
      
, and their excitement is infectious. It’s made me realize how excited I am for sophomore year.

I’m trying to be more conscious about the time between my drafts and actually posting, and part of that requires not thinking so heavily on each word, so bare with me as I’m trying to get back into the comfort of writing :’) That being said, here’s a quick ~brain dump~ of all the things I’m excited for this year!

Brass Rat & RingComm

We’re getting our
         class rings
      
 this year!!!!!!! It almost feels wrong if I didn’t list this somewhere near the top of my list. I am so, so, so, so excited. I remember being in high school reading the blogs about the brass rat, and I feel an infinite amount of excitement about getting one this year. Equally as important to me, this year marks the more conscious journey to being halfway through my undergraduate education, and that is something I’m really proud of.

I’m also part of RingComm this year! We’ve been working together over the summer, and it’s quickly become one of my favorite experiences. When I applied to be a blogger, I partially wrote about how I enjoy capturing memories in creative ways and am learning to better understand different communities. To me, being on RingComm really helps fulfill both of those desires in a new way. I can confidently say it’s one of the most unique experiences I’ve been able to be part of :’)

 

20.110 & 17.307

Excited for a class is a… strong term… but I choose to have optimism! I’m taking 20.110: Thermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems this semester. Thermodynamics isn’t necessarily the field that I’m most interested in, BUT it will be my first Course 20 class since declaring my major! In an all-too-optimistic state, I tried studying for 20.110 over the summer but quickly stopped once my internship started picking up. I vaguely remember something about isothermal systems, gas expansion, and heat capacity? Regardless, I’m hoping that taking a Course 20 class will help me better understand what I want to study in the future.

I’m also taking 17.307: Public Policy for Washington Interns, which is a small class in coordination with the other MIT Washington DC Summer Internship Program interns. The class involves writing a policy paper, which I’ve barely read many of, let alone written one. I’m excited to see what the paper-writing process looks like—sans biological materials, laboratory methods, and yield percentages—from a public policy perspective.

 

Declaring Course 20!

Speaking of 20.110…I declared Course 20! I have
        a not-yet-posted blog
      
 about how I’m still feeling slightly ~conflicted~ about this but submitted my Choice of Major Form to the office happily last Spring regardless.

I recently went through some journal entries from my freshman year, and I wrote about several moments where I felt academically inferiorer or not smart enough to confidently declare a major. I can’t say I’m 100% confident in declaring Course 20 now, but I can for sure say that I feel the most confident I’ve been, which is a huge step from last year.

I recently got my Course 20 advisor, too! She focuses on studying biomaterials for medical therapeutics and devices. I have admittedly spent too much time learning about her interests in biological engineering, and I’m really excited to learn more from her. I’m not a huge fan of straight molecular and cellular biology, which is largely why I chose Course 20 over Course 7. I also had loosely considered Course 3, but ultimately decided that Course 20 better suited my interests. I feel a lot more relieved entering my second year knowing my advisor is also interested in biomaterials, and I’m excited to meet her in September!

 

Writing, Journaling, & Blogging

At some point last Spring, I threw all my blog drafts into a massive Google Doc that I’ve been
        slowly
      
chugging through to post in hopes of catching up to my current life. For example, I have a good chunk of almost-done, backlogged blog posts from the end of Spring semester that never surfaced after school ended.

I mentioned briefly above that I’m trying to be more confident in my writing to reduce the amount of time I spend between drafting and posting. I’ve spent more time this Summer casually journaling, which has helped me become a bit more comfortable with writing. I’d like to think I’ve gotten through the
        first-year-posting jitters
      
 and the fear of being perceived; I’m hoping to be on my way to posting more thoughtful posts like I originally wanted.

 

Balancing Friends & Clubs

I think during your first-year there’s a lot of
        pressure to talk to everyone at any chance you get
      
simply because you want to tackle the school year with as many friends as possible. This was nice to meet new people but also definitely exhausting for me. Some of that pressure has finally worn off, which makes going out with friends to events and around Boston feel a lot more natural.

I’m also finding myself enjoying the activities and their communities I’m involved in this year more. It’s nice to be able to take a more active role in certain clubs once learning what really interested me about them. For example, I joined Student Events Board Exec this year, and it’s been nice to feel more comfortable with the team and help plan bonding activities!

 

Arts & Crafty Things

When my senior year of high school kicked in, my brain began to register that I would be going to school out-of-state with limited storage capacity. I spent most of that year with friends before leaving for college, and some of my art-related hobbies slipped to the side. I ended up giving away a lot of my art supplies since I knew I wouldn’t bring them with me to college, but I started painting again this Summer.

I’m hoping to stay in Boston this Summer, so I’m feeling a bit more optimistic in my ability to keep up with painting, especially since I’m having a lot more fun with it now than ever before. My roommate has also recently gotten into scrapbooking, and I was quickly sucked into the world of stationery yet again. I also want to try crocheting, pottery, and embroidery at least once during this semester!

I know the sophomore slump™ may be inevitable, and that this whole blog has been incredibly optimistic. To be clear, I’m still ~very scared~ of college, classes, and psets, but those are just a couple of things I’m looking forward to this year :’)

I talked mainly about school and my own interests, but I’m also excited for my friends and family. My brother is in his final year of undergrad, and my family will be attending our first college graduation ceremony! It feels poetic that I’ll hit the half-way mark when he’s walking across the stage graduating, and I can’t wait.",,0
“What the hell is water?”,David duKor-Jackson,0,2024-08-27T00:00:00-04:00,"In his 2005 commencement address to the graduates and assembled guests at Kenyon College, noted author David Foster Wallace began… “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’”

(DFW went on to deliver a timeless and celebrated address that is well worth checking out when you have the chance. )

I find that I am frequently referencing that story as I think about the challenges we have getting applicants to share information and insights about their lives in ways that help us to contextualize their achievements.  We have struggled in the admissions office to craft questions and prompts that elicit substantive and meaningful responses. While I accept the possibility that we just haven’t gotten the prompts quite right, I think it is more likely that a) applicants simply don’t understand what information we are looking for, and b) even if they understand what we are looking for, most people, including those who apply to MIT, have a difficult time thinking about and articulating what is most meaningful about their own lived experiences. 

Within our large and exceptionally talented pool of applicants, students routinely produce impressive academic portfolios of achievement and distinction.  There are, however, important qualitative considerations in how we assess and evaluate what we determine to be exceptional,  and it is partially up to applicants to help us to identify the true trail blazers. As I have said repeatedly over the years, “the factor that is both most salient, and most likely to swing an admission decision in a highly selective process, is what an applicant makes of the opportunities that are available to them.”  A corollary is that “…we may look just as favorably on the trajectory and distance traveled as we do on the heights achieved.”

This is all to say that in order to best evaluate applicants it is helpful to have an understanding of the “water” in which they are swimming, or context as it is more commonly referred to.  DFW explains “The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.”

Ultimately though, we are dependent upon what applicants choose to tell us, and if they choose not to share anything of substance, we have a lot less to base our decisions on.  So while I wish that I could leave you with something more concrete along the lines of “do this” or “don’t do that.”  Instead, I have to hope that making you aware of our interest in the water in which you are swimming gives you sufficient inspiration to think more deeply and share more readily, the contextual insights that help us to better understand you and your achievements.",,0

 As this post goes up, prefrosh are jumping right into Residence Exploration (REX!!), where they’ll explore MIT’s many different residential communities and make their final choices about where to live.

REX is fun, and REX is exciting, but REX can also be a bit of a stressful time. People talk a lot about how important your living group is to your “college experience,” whether it’s becoming best friends with your roommates or being super involved with your dorm. And they’re not wrong about how great residential community can be–it’s a big part of many MIT students’ lives, and living with your friends means you see them organically every day. This is particularly useful when the rest of college is… not super conducive to that. There’s no single cafeteria where everyone eats lunch, and no shared bell schedule that determines when everyone is free, so if you don’t literally live with your friends, it takes effort to organize time with them.

Residential communities are the cheat code, so finding a good fit for yourself can feel high-stakes. I was super nervous about this during REX, and even more so after I realized that my dorm floor wasn’t 
        the best fit for me
      
. Some people have zero problem with this, whether they’re just great at planning things with friends or don’t really need to be around people all the time. Unfortunately, though, that’s not me, and I was really worried that I would miss out on the closeness of those residential friendships.

But fear not! As I’ve learned over the last year, residential communities are absolutely not your only option. There are so many ways to find your people in college, and I want to talk about one specific option: friend groups.

As middle school as that phrase feels, my “friend group” has been the best part of my MIT experience. Of course, 99% of the reason for this is that MY FRIENDS ARE AWESOME AND I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. But I’ve already talked about this, and also you’re not allowed to steal my friends, so I want to focus on something much smaller but still pretty cool: When it comes to finding consistent opportunities to spend time with friends, the “group” part of “friend group” can be great at mirroring the dynamic of residential friendships. If of my friends didn’t know each other, I’d have to constantly coordinate disjoint times with each of them independently just to hang out, and with the way our schedules interlock, that’s tough. Sith a group, we still coordinate stuff one-on-one like this when we can, but since we all do know each other, we can unlock so much more hangout time just by gathering whoever is free at any given time.

Again, since we’re focusing on the “group” part of “friend group,” you’re on your own when it comes to 
        finding the friends
      
. What I’m more interested in is how that nebulous initial cluster of half-strangers becomes an actual, solid friend group that replicates the closeness of residential friendships. The social engineering! The cult formation! The manipulation!

RE: social engineering: I was very annoyed to discover that this term is usually used to describe advanced phishing techniques, which is… not what I’m talking about. The more relevant definition is this: “the use of centralized planning in an attempt to manage social change and regulate the future development and behavior of a society.” Which… does sound very manipulative, and I swear I’m not trying to promote manipulating your friends 😭. Or at least, not unless you’re all doing it to each other. To spend more time together! So it’s really just… persuasion. For an excellent cause.

Anyways. That’s what I really want to talk about (although you’d never guess from how it took me 700 words to get to the point…). You have a group of people who like each other, but you all live in different places, and there’s no organic impetus for you to assemble. How do you fix this?

Group chat group chat group chat

First of all, group chat. I mean, you don’t need me to tell you that, but let’s go deeper.

I feel like group chats are such a defining feature of our generation’s social structure–and by structure I mean structure. There’s nothing as cut-and-dry as being in the group chat or not being in it. That really, really sucks sometimes, and I imagine that people pre-internet had much less 
        rigidly defined
      
 friend groups than we do now.

As exclusionary as group chats can be, though, they’re also one of the best resources for facilitating opportunities to hang out. Without a group chat, the 
        only way
      
 you’ll all end up in the same place again is by pure chance. Even if it’s awkward to start one, I suggest making group chats early, and often.

Group Chat Architecture

While we’re on the topic of making group chats, though, I want spread some personal propaganda: I really believe that group chats should be constructed with the same attention you’d give to crafting a physical living space!! Most people make group chats on Instagram, or Whatsapp, or 
        Facebook Messenger
      
. This is perfectly fine for smaller groups, but once you start getting more than [insert arbitrary number… 7??] people, you might have more conversation than a single thread can handle.

Say you’re in the middle of planning an outing to Boston Commons, and you have to confirm that Person A is free on Saturday at 12:00. In the meantime, though, person B has a funny story from class, and person C wants to know where everyone is eating dinner. Boston Commons gets buried, person A doesn’t see the message, and on Saturday you find out that person A can’t make it, and now everyone is sad :(

This is why I’m a pretty big fan of Discord, because with a Discord server, you basically have one group chat with many different “channels”, or threads of conversation. You can have one for announcements, so people don’t miss that Boston Commons is happening on Saturday at 12:00. You can have one to post group dinner receipts, one to collect quotes, or even one for 
        extremely scientific polls
      
. Then you can go further and make sub-group chats–for example, a temporary “thread” that everyone going to Boston Commons can 
        add themselves to
      
. Discord servers also allow for concrete manifestations of inside jokes, whether it’s through custom emojis, channel names, wonky bots, or stupid nicknames. Just like how you’d decorate a physical living space!

Leveraging Group Chats

Thinking about group chats as living spaces isn’t just an infrastructure thing, though–it’s even more relevant when you’re actually using them to gather people. With residential communities and their physical living spaces, one of the best things is that you can just pop into the hallway or floor lounge to find dinner companions. But with a non-residential friend group, there’s nowhere you can reliably find everyone.

That is, except for the group chat!!

Looking for a lunch buddy? Text the group chat. Need some homework help? Text the group chat. Want someone to do something very stupid but very funny with you? Text the group chat. The group chat can function just like a physical floor lounge or hallway in terms of gathering people together, and in fact, in some ways a group chat is even more useful, because you lift the need for physical & temporal alignment in organic interactions. If you have a random thought, or see something funny in the hallway, or just feel like talking, you can message the group chat at any time. More importantly, you unlock the ability to plan group activities without having to gather everyone in person. I seriously have NO IDEA how people did this before smartphones…

Planning Shenanigans

Even with a group chat, though, it can still be a bit tricky to plan things. (After all, residential communities have funding and social chairs whose job is planning activities.) We’re all still figuring this out, but here’s a few observations from last year: First, MIT has so many free student events going on all the time! Look at posters, keep an ear open, and most importantly, check your 
        dormspam
      
. It’s a lot easier to gather folks to go to a pre-established event. Also! Make sure you know what times people wake up. We never did anything on a weekend before 
        noon
      
, because all of us were asleep. Even when we said we’d wake up for something, we did not 😭. Finally, proposing shenaniganery in person has been slightly more successful, even if the details are worked out online. You get a better gauge of people’s interest, and humans are very bandwagon-y, so if we see each other interested in an activity, we’re more likely to go.

Routines

Ok, so shenanigans are awesome, but people are busy allll the time, and consistently planning things still takes effort. This is where routines come in! Every day, as classes wind down, my friends and I always gather in the 
        same space
      
 to study together. From there, we grab dinner together around 6:00, and after that a subset of us will even branch off to study in one of the dorms. We try to send location updates to the group chat so that even more people can join, but at any point in this journey, someone might send a variant of the “where (are) people/ppl?” text (>100 of these show up in our chat). More ways to leverage the group chat! Hooray!

It genuinely makes such a difference to have this routine, and to know that I can find people to hang out with if I need. I might have club meetings every Tuesday afternoon, and others may have classes or rehearsals or very necessary naptime, but if I’ve had a rough day of classes, I know for sure that at least one person will be in our study space to goof off with between 2:00 and 6:00 pm. We don’t need to plan days in advance every time we want to study or grab dinner together, we just do. Like clockwork. And that consistency means a lot during the chaos of the school year, so if you’re able to create some group routines, they can be great.

Andddd now you have a cult!

Or, well, maybe you’re 10% of the way there. Kinda.

Jokes aside, these structures really have helped me feel just as close with my friends as if they all slept two doors down the hall. I’m actually glad that my residential community didn’t quite work out, because that’s partly what lead me to the friends I have now. They really are absolutely the best part of MIT, and getting to see them almost every day means the world ☺️.

Then again, everything I’ve described here is very anecdotal and specific to my friends and I. The structures that work for you could be completely different, and besides, structures can only do so much. It’s really just about finding your people, which you can do through your dorm, but also so many other ways that aren’t right here, right now. You will find your people! You will find your people, and you will find whatever dynamics work for you, and you will make plenty of mischief together :D",,0
MIT after SFFA,Stu Schmill '86,20,2024-08-21T00:00:00-04:00,"Today I spoke with MIT News about the impact the Supreme Court’s decision in the SFFA case had on the composition of the Class of 2028, why it matters, and what we plan to do next. You should read that interview, as well as an accompanying message from President Sally Kornbluth. 

Here, on the blogs, I want to share some personal reflections on what this means to me, both because I am ultimately responsible for the makeup of our undergraduate student body, and also because MIT has been my home for more than forty years. 

One hot summer day, many years ago now, I packed a green Army surplus duffle bag full of all my clothes and boarded a Greyhound bus to Boston. I arrived at South Station, took the Red Line to Kendall Square, and walked along Memorial Drive until I got to Killian Court. I remember standing there, seeing the Great Dome for the first time, 
        all on my own
      
 and feeling just 
        enormously intimidated by the place.
      
 It was freshman orientation in August 1982, and I — a skinny seventeen year old Jewish kid from a public high school in Queens — was about to begin my college education at the most famous institution of science and technology on the planet. 

I moved into New House — a dorm known even in the eighties for its multicultural community —  where I shared a 
        forced triple
      
 with Scott from New Jersey and Victor from Lynn, two guys I met by chance in the barbecue line and 
        with whom I became fast friends.
      
 In those days, 
        Paul Gray was the President of MIT,
      
 and could often be seen trundling across campus making spirited conversation with freshmen and faculty alike. Because I was small, but loud, I was 
        recruited to be a coxswain of the crew team.
      
 I figured out pretty quickly that I was practical and liked working on projects with my hands, so I declared Course 2, where I took 
        2.03 with Jim Williams,
      
 
        2.70 with Woodie Flowers,
      
 and 
        2.72 with Ernesto Blanco,
      
 among others.   

Jim, Woodie, Ernesto, and the rest of my professors taught me a lot, but like most college students, I learned even more from my friends. Like many MIT students before and since, I could not believe my good fortune to be surrounded by such incredible company. When I think back, most of what I learned at MIT and its value wasn’t even really in the classroom itself. The laws of physics are the same everywhere, and 
        I could have picked up the basic principles of engineering from a textbook at the New York Public Library.
      
 It was my fellow students — who hailed from Georgia to Guyana and everywhere in between — that made being at MIT so special. 

I found myself surrounded by smart, kind, creative people, who came from around the country and the world to attend MIT because we all wanted to 
        solve hard problems in the company of brilliant peers.
      
 What we didn’t realize, but soon learned, is that what enabled us to actually teach and learn from each other was that 
        we had such different ideas and experiences,
      
 but were united by a 
        shared standard of academic excellence,
      
 a 
        collective interest in science and technology,
      
 and a 
        sense of mission to use our interests and aptitudes to serve the nation and the world.
      


I wasn’t all on my own after all. I had all of them, from every walk of life, with me every step of the way down the Infinite Corridor. 

My classmates and I benefited from the fact that, even back in 1982, MIT already had a 
        long history
      
 of advancing equal opportunity and racial integration in STEM education. Seventy years ago, in May 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education; a few months later, MIT hosted what is believed to be the first national conference on the topic of anti-discrimination in higher education. During the early days of the Civil Rights Era, the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid (CUAFA) directed more recruitment at predominantly minority high schools, and the 
        student-run MIT Science Day Camp
      
 evolved into the federally-funded national program Upward Bound. 

Then, in 1968, MIT launched the Task Force on Educational Opportunity, chaired by then-Professor Paul Gray and including faculty, staff, and 
        student leaders.
      
 The Task Force had a 
        clear sense of purpose
      
 and moved rapidly to greatly expand MIT’s 
        recruitment
      
 and 
        financial aid,
      
 incubate the student-led programs that became MITES and Interphase, and 
        undertake other bold initiatives,
      
 including student-run tutoring programs for Cambridge youth that exist to this day. In a report reflecting on the early years of these initiatives, Paul described the vision and values that guided these initiatives in his plainspoken manner: 

We undertake these actions and adopt these policies not because we are required to, but because it is right and proper that we do so, [for] we are persuaded that the Institute becomes a stronger, more effective place as it draws on the full range of human talent and experience.

We undertake these actions and adopt these policies not because we are required to, but because it is right and proper that we do so, [for] we are persuaded that the Institute becomes a stronger, more effective place as it draws on the full range of human talent and experience.

Decades later, long after his presidency and subsequent chairmanship of the MIT Corporation, Paul led the search committee that hired me as the Dean of Admissions in 2008; he also served on CUAFA. In my first few years in this role, he and I got lunch several times a semester, and I have always been grateful for his mentorship, guided as it was by both his mind and his heart. Paul never stopped being an MIT professor, first and foremost; he helped teach me everything I learned about the important work with which I had been entrusted. 

What sticks with me most from those invaluable conversations was Paul’s personal conviction that 
        his initiatives to diversify MIT
      
 constituted the most important work he had done in all of his time in our leadership. Paul knew, as well as anyone ever has, that the key lesson an MIT education teaches is the skillful self-confidence that no problem is too hard to tackle, and he thought it was crucial that this lesson be made more 
        broadly available.
      
 He impressed upon me that carrying on this legacy of meritocratic pluralism — the synthesis of diversity and excellence — was an essential responsibility for the Dean of Admissions at a place like MIT. 

This responsibility looms large in my mind, and weighs heavily in my heart, as I contemplate the change to MIT brought about by the Supreme Court’s decision in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (SFFA) case last year. In an interview with MIT News today, I discussed the impact of the Court’s decision, why it matters, and what we plan to do next. I encourage you to read the full interview, but here are the five key things you really need to know:   

- After the SFFA decision, we expanded our 
        recruitment
      
 and 
        financial aid initiatives
      
 to further improve access to the Institute for students from all backgrounds, led by a new policy whereby 
        students from families earning less than $75,000 a year pay nothing to attend
      
 

- Despite these initiatives, and 
        as we expected,
      
 there was still a 
        decline in the proportion
      
 of enrolling first-years from 
        historically under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds
      


- This is because the SFFA decision 
        effectively bans our ability to consider race and ethnicity
      
 to assemble a broadly diverse class, and students from historically under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds are under-represented due to 
        persistent and profound racial inequality in American K-12 education
      
 that is 
        especially pronounced in the areas of math and science
      
 most important for 
        preparing students to study STEM in college
      


- This significant change in class composition comes with no change to the 
        quantifiable academic characteristics of the class
      
 that we use to predict success at MIT

- However, if MIT cannot 
        find a way
      
 to continue to draw on the full range of human talent and experience in the future, it may threaten the qualitative strength of the MIT education, both by a relative reduction in the educational benefits of diversity and by 
        making our community less attractive to the best students from all backgrounds.
      
 

For a very long time, there has been no topic in college admissions more controversial than the consideration of race. In my sixteen years as Dean of Admissions, I have heard every complaint and critique you can imagine from every political, professional, and personal perspective. There are those who believe that MIT has cared too much about diversity, and there are those who believe we have never cared enough. There are those who believe we have been racist by using race-conscious admissions to enroll diverse classes, and those who believe we have been racist by reinstating our testing requirement. These viewpoints are so diametrically opposed, and so deeply held, that it can feel impossible to reconcile them and 
        persuade people to find common ground.
      


So I’m not going to attempt that in this post. 

Instead, I want to tell you what I believe. 

I believe that every student we have admitted on my watch was admitted because they were demonstrably well-qualified for, and well-matched to, the MIT education, and because we saw how their presence in the class would improve the collective experience for everyone. We have long valued 
        potential over pedigree,
      
 and our 
        egalitarian approach
      
 to evaluating 
        excellence across contexts
      
 has enabled us to select students whose potential might have been 
        otherwise masked or limited
      
 without compromising the quality of the class. I believe this not only because I have read applications, 
        seen what we demand for academic standards,
      
 and advised generations of first-year students, but also because as MIT has become more broadly diverse, 
        academic outcomes have improved for all students
      
 and we have simultaneously 
        become more attractive to the most talented students from all backgrounds.
      
 As in metals and magnets, the strongest materials are alloys, where many different materials are mixed together to achieve composite strength that can collectively withstand the greatest challenges. The same is true of our student body. 

I believe that MIT’s longtime strategy of 
        using standardized tests to recruit students and validate academic preparation,
      
 combined with the 
        narrow consideration of race before SFFA to draw from the full breadth of human talent,
      
 had long helped diversify and strengthen MIT, as well as the industries and institutions downstream of the Institute. I believe this because according to the American Society for Engineering Education, 
        over the last decade
      
 MIT has graduated more engineers from 
        historically under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds
      
 than 
        any other private college or university (and the vast majority of public universities) in the United States.
      
 These students have gone on to thrive as leaders in 
        academia,
      
 industry, government, and many other fields. We should be proud of this legacy and the alumni who constitute it, and we must find ways to continue to educate future generations of diverse STEM leaders in this new legal landscape.  

I believe that the answer to the question of “how much diversity is necessary to benefit the MIT education?” is fundamentally 
        qualitative, not quantitative.
      
 However, I also believe that when there are now fewer African-American first-years enrolling at MIT than when I was a freshman more than forty years ago, that cannot possibly be the right outcome for our community; not in a country as large and increasingly diverse as ours, and not at an institution with our history and our values. While we must comply with the law, we also must also find a way to hold our 
        pathways to leadership open,
      
 or we may all experience 
        long-term downstream consequences concentrated in the already-unequal area of STEM,
      
 where we most need the 
        creativity and insight generated by broadly diverse teams
      
 inventing the future of the nation and the world. 

These convictions underpin our recommitment to the institutional mission — articulated in the message that President Sally Kornbluth sent the MIT community today — that 
        Paul defined for the Task Force
      
 more than half a century ago: 

The Institute has much to offer in terms of the kind of education that elevates, empowers, and liberates people, and it seems to me that we must not fail to make those opportunities accessible on a broad scale [through] the development of programs [that include] persons whose promise, talent, and potential have been masked or limited by second-rate educational experiences, by poverty, or by social prejudice and discrimination…[We must recognize] the limitations of any educational environment that fails to come to grips with problems growing out of a long history of inequality of opportunity [and our] responsibility to contribute toward the ultimate resolution of the social crisis which divides this nation and imperils its future.

As I told MIT News, throughout the last year, my team and I have been meeting with student leaders, faculty committees, and President Kornbluth and her team to explore what we can do to uphold this mission while complying with the law. In addition to the expanded recruitment and financial aid initiatives we launched last year with their support, we have also created new pathways for students to demonstrate their math and science preparation beyond what is locally available. These initiatives proved necessary, but not sufficient; we are dismayed, but not discouraged. We believe, as generations of MIT’s leaders have, that no problem is too hard for us to tackle as a team. 

We do not know, yet, where these initiatives will take us. When navigating unknown territory, we must often rely on compasses over maps: guided not by a well-trodden path to a certain destination, but instead oriented by the powerful magnetism of our longstanding institutional conviction that MIT becomes, as Paul put it, a stronger, more effective place as it draws on the full range of human talent and experience. 

This compass point remains, as I wrote last year, “the North Star by which we will steer through uncertain waters ahead.” Like any long, hard voyage, we will need favorable winds, an able crew, and a steady hand at the tiller to make the passage together. My four decades at MIT give me confidence that no matter what else is happening in the world, on this matter, we will all be rowing together, hard against the current, until we reach the shore.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GCP-00008711.jpeg

Home Under the Dome,Emiko P. '25,3,2024-08-14T00:00:00-04:00,"Now that it’s August, the fall semester is right around the corner – which also means sorority recruitment will be here before we know it. Because sorority recruitment inevitably has some confusing aspects – What is a sorority? How do I sign up? When is recruitment? What’s the commitment? – I thought I’d explain what Greek life at MIT is like, especially as someone who was at first hesitant to the idea. Despite the 
        initial hesitancy,
      
 joining my sorority has ended up being one of the one of the best and most impactful decisions I’ve made regarding my MIT experience. 

Whether you are interested in joining a sorority or are just curious, I encourage you to read and learn more about the process!

Intro to Panhel

What is Panhel? MIT has six sororities, and the MIT Panhellenic Council (Panhel) is the umbrella organization overseeing these sororities. It is basically an organization that encompasses the sorority side of Greek life at MIT. Panhel is the largest women and non-binary community on campus (making up ⅓ of all undergraduate women at MIT!), and it helps cultivate, support, and guide the sorority experience.

My Experience During Recruitment

- Year One. I have been involved in Greek life since my very first year at MIT. My freshman year, I was a Potential New Member (PNM), which, as the name suggests, is someone who is looking to join and be a new member of a sorority. I participated in Fully Structured Recruitment (FSR), which is the main recruiting event of the year and always occurs in fall the weekend before classes start. FSR is over the span of four days, where you get the opportunity to talk to every single sorority at least once. It was admittedly pretty intense because we talked for hours straight, but I met some people during this process that I am still friends with, and I found my chapter and home for my 4 years at MIT. It was a cool experience starting classes the very 
        next day
      
 after recruitment ended, wearing my chapter’s shirt, and seeing girls all around school in my sorority. It was comforting for newbie frosh Emi to know that she had another community along with the soccer team.

- Year Two. My sophomore year, I helped from the sorority side and talked to the Potential New Members myself. There was a lot of preparation and decoration that needed to be done to make sure the PNMs felt welcome, were comfortable, and could have fun. It was honestly such a bonding experience with my chapter, and it was super cool to be able to meet and get to know the new class. I vividly remember the first time I talked to my eventual little during this process – we clicked instantly.

- Year Three. My junior year, I was a Panhellenic Recruitment Counselor (PRC)! That means I temporarily disassociated from my sorority chapter and helped guide PNMs through the crazy ride that is the recruitment process. PRCs are meant to be an unbiased sounding board, and we are your partners in crime for the week. I was on the orange PRC team, and it was awesome because we were all in different sororities. This process really helped me appreciate the Panhel community as a whole – it’s cool that, when joining a sorority, you not only join that community, but the entire Greek life community. My PRC team spent the 4 days of recruitment week taking care of all of the Potential New Members. We coordinated and made sure not a single mistake was made in terms of lines, time, and schedules, we helped them find hard-to-reach recruitment rooms, and we danced to 2010s throwbacks in the hallways.

- Year Four! This year, as a senior, I will be doing what I did sophomore year again and talking to the PNMs with my chapter. Hopefully, I’ll end up talking to some of you reading this during recruitment!

Orange PRC team!

Recruitment Week Info

Overall, recruitment is a huge organized effort. The PRCs and sororities train and prepare an entire week before recruitment actually starts, and each sorority’s recruitment team spends a ton of time over the summer to get everything ready. 

Here is a link to more information that has everything you need to know about recruitment: https://www.mitpanhel.com/recruitment 

It has the site for registration, a booklet that talks about the recruitment week schedule, specifics about each chapter (their cost, values, mission, etc), FAQs, and more. Definitely check it out!

 

Screenshot of the 2024 schedule. Note that a “party” is where you get to meet and chat with a new sorority.

Some Tips for Recruitment

- Keep an open mind! In high school, I would’ve never guessed I’d be in a sorority, but I’m glad I gave the process a chance. Also, if you are remotely interested, the best way to learn more about sorority life is to go through recruitment, talk to the girls, and see what the vibes are like yourself :) Some people realize that recruitment might not be for them during this process, and that’s totally okay! There are no consequences or problems if you decide you want to withdraw.

- Don’t be afraid to voice concerns. Ask your PRC or the chapter members if there’s anything you’re confused about regarding recruitment or sorority life in general.

- Be prepared for some long days! You will talk to every chapter here, so that’s a LOT of conversations. It’s totally doable, and while it does take effort, trust me, it’s worth it. The PRCs will help you get through these long days – they’ll have fanny packs stuffed with mints and cough drops just for you.

- Focus on the values of each chapter! Maybe you care about academics, passion, humor, or family. Try and see if any chapters reflect the same values, because that’s how you’re really going to figure out which chapter fits you and what you care about best. 

- Follow your gut. There are a ton of people that go through this recruitment process with you. It can be easy to want to join the chapter that your friends really like, but let it be a personal decision. Everyone I know has friends in every single chapter – you’ll be just fine if you don’t choose the same one as your buddies! Panhel as a whole is a community, too, no matter the specific sorority you’re in.

- Take lots of notes! Literally so much happens during the day that I would’ve forgotten everything if I hadn’t furiously typed it down in my notes app. 

- What should I bring? You should bring a few outfits you feel comfortable in, but there’s no real dress code (although the last day tends to be more formal). Each day you should also bring a water bottle and something to take notes with. No letters of recommendation or anything like that is needed. 

- Have fun with it!

My Experience in a Sorority

So, now that you know a bit more about the recruitment process, let me give you a quick run-down of the things I’ve loved about my MIT sorority experience over the past three years.

- My friends. After my freshman year at New Vassar, I moved into the sorority house in Boston, which would end up being my home for the next three years. Living with 60 girls meant that my roommates, next-door neighbors, and housemates are all girls that have become my close friends. I genuinely can’t imagine living anywhere else. 

- My roommates. I’ve lived with them in the house for the last two years, and we are running it back again together for our senior year. They’re the best roommates ever (shoutout Avani N. ‘25 and Eva O. ‘25!! Yap session soon, please). Glad they tolerate the ever-present pile of laundry by my bed.

- My famline. In a sorority, there’s a tradition where an older girl in the sorority (the “big”) mentors a younger girl in the sorority (the “little”). The cycle continues when the little chooses her own little. This creates a long chain of relationships, known as a “famline.” My famline is amazing: my big has been like the older sister I never had from day one, and my little makes sure my life always remains spontaneous and fun.

- The wisdom of the older girls. I have had so many mentors who’ve helped me with everything from mapping out my Course 2 classes, to prepping me for internship interviews, to guiding me through college sports. It was comforting to know that if I was struggling or confused, as one often is in college, I always had a sister to hold my hand and navigate me through the uneven and overwhelming terrain.

- Building empowering female relationships. It has genuinely improved my life to surround myself with hardworking and inspirational women who have similar interests as me. My biggest female role model has always been my mom, and a lot of my sorority sisters remind me of her. I feel like that unapologetic, confident energy has definitely rubbed off on me over the years.

- Studying together. We have a library in our house called The Study, and there’s always someone in there working. It’s very reassuring to know that if you’re grinding on a hard PSET, someone else in the house is, too. It’s also way more fun to do work around other people. 

- Taking a break from the grind. Life isn’t all about work, so it’s nice to be in an environment where having fun together outside of school is encouraged. This comes in the form of study breaks (strawberries and whipped cream desserts, writing letters to each other, watching movies in the basement), organizing mixers with other social groups, hosting events at our house where we invite all our friends and professors to hang out, retreats like apple picking, and just talking to one of the 60 sisters in the house.

- Homemade dinner. We have a personal chef who makes dinner 5/7 days of the week and sandwiches every day for lunch. I’m usually starving after soccer practice, so coming home to a warm, home-cooked meal is a blessing.

- LIVING IN BOSTON!!! My sorority’s house is across the river from campus (to get to campus is a 5 minute scooter ride, 15 minute walk). Let me tell you, this is prime real-estate, people. I live a 5 minute walk from Newbury, one of the most iconic streets in Boston. I can see – and hear – Fenway Park from my window. Cafe 472, an MIT classic for ice cream that gives you like six scoops per serving, is right across the street. Life is good.

- It’s what you make of it. You can be as committed as you want to a sorority or as laid back as you want (to a certain extent). In terms of requirements, we have a meeting once a week on Sunday and a few mandatory philanthropic and sisterhood activities, like volunteering at a fundraiser or supporting fellow members at a sports game.

- Instant community. I literally had a support system before my first day of school even started, and my sorority is a community I continue to lean on to this day. 

Each experience has its ups and downs. I had my doubts at times, and nothing is ever perfect, but I’m truly happy with how this decision of joining a sorority has turned out for me. I am in no way saying that everyone needs to join a sorority, but I am saying that finding a living group and a community has enriched my MIT experience. If you find something at college – a club, a dorm, an athletic team, a friend in one of your classes, a UROP team – that evokes a similar feeling to what I just talked about, then nurture those relationships and hold on tight.

I can’t wait to see so many new faces on campus this year, and I hope everyone has a fun last month of summer before we’re back on campus in August!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor9-7-400x533.jpg

[Guest Post] a space for women at mit,Kanokwan T. '26,2,2024-08-12T00:00:00-04:00,"- In 1870, 
        MIT admitted its first woman: Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards.
      


- In 1882, MIT officially began admitting women to all departments. 

- Throughout the 1880s, +100 women enrolled as students at MIT.

- In the 1950s, women made up 1-3% of the MIT student body.

- 
In 1964, Katherine Dexter McCormick—a MIT biology graduate—funded the construction of McCormick Hall: the first women’s dormitory at MIT.


- Fast forward to 2023: MIT’s admitted students was comprised of 48% women. 


        The history of women at MIT is long and rich.
      
Originally, women were not allowed to enroll—which was normal of universities back in the day—
        but much has changed since then.
      
One thing that’s changed is dedicated physical space. I’m thankful that there’s a lounge carved out on campus for us: the Margaret Cheney Room.

I’ve studied at a lot of lounges around campus; few have impressed me as much as this one. It feels cozy yet spacious. There are rooms for both the quiet and the conversational. In this space, you can do most anything: I’ve taken naps on the couches, grabbed coffee from the Keurig, and had good work sessions at the river-facing tables. To top it all off, it’s located in the heart of main campus. I thought to highlight this space, so I asked Nandini, one of the main staff members who runs the lounge 
, to tell you more about it.

Hello! My name is Nandini Choudhury (she/hers), and I am the Assistant Director of the Women and Gender Services (WXGS). Today, I’m guest posting about the WXGS Office and the Margaret Cheney Room, a study/social space accessible to all women and non-binary undergraduate, graduate, doctoral, and post-doctoral students at MIT. 

Our space is located in Building 3, Room 308. The Cheney Room is a lovely space, and if you want to learn about the Cheney Room and the WXGS Office, check us out at studentlife.mit.edu/womenmit!

History of the Margaret Cheney Room

In 1884, recognizing the importance of providing a space dedicated to women’s needs, especially in the context of the STEM fields, MIT founded the Margaret Cheney Room. In light of its founding mission, the Cheney Room underwent a large renovation that was started in 2021 and was completed in February 2023. 

Before the renovation, the Margaret Cheney was smaller and many repairs needed to be managed. WXGS received the Margaret Cheney endowment that allowed the renovation to occur, and working with MIT leadership, allowed the space to be expanded to women and non-binary individuals.

The space now exists to promote community and empower all students at MIT who experience gender-based systems of oppression as it relates to being a woman, the experiences of womanhood, and/or the complexities of gender diversity. Gender is nuanced and complex in ways that extend far beyond the original understanding of the 1880s. WXGS welcomes you wholly as you are and encourages you to be your authentic self with us and with others who use the Cheney Room.

Current usage

The Cheney Room is a beautiful, open space with natural light filtering in through the large windows located in the 4 zones: WXGS Office, multipurpose space, kitchen, and the lounge suite.

- The WXGS Office is where the Assistant Director of WXGS primarily works.

- The multipurpose space is primarily used for events and programs, and has a smart TV with streaming capabilities and can be used to project presentations from a laptop.

- The kitchen has tables and chairs for sitting, a fridge/freezer, microwave, and toaster oven that the students can use.

- The lounge suite has a private Zoom room, conference room with a smart TV, a quiet/lactation room, and lockers. The lounge suite also has a Keurig for free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate.

Student organizations

The space is used by over 970 women and non-binary students for studying, attending events, and socializing. 20 student organizations including, but not limited to, Taara, CRWN, MEGAWomen, Shift + W, UWiP, and BWA have hosted their own events and programs in the space as well.

Library

The Cheney Room has a library with 138+ fiction and non-fiction books. The books are curated to foster intersectionality and belonging, and include MIT authors and alumni. The fiction and non-fiction authors are women, women of color, LBTQ+, non-binary, and gender diverse. The genres include, but are not limited to, science fiction, fantasy, comics, non-fiction, and biographies.

art pieces

The Cheney Room also has 22 art pieces created by women and non-binary artists, and a hybrid digital piano donated by Women and Gender Studies.

How to get access

The Cheney Room is open to all women and non-binary undergraduate, graduate, doctoral, and post-doctoral students who are registered at MIT. You can gain tap access to the Cheney Room by filling out the tap access form. Once you fill out the form, WXGS staff members will be notified and will give you access in 24-48 hours. 

We hope to see you in the space soon!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Before-2-800x618.jpg

TESS Science Conference III,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",2,2024-08-07T00:00:00-04:00,"This summer, I started a new 
        UROP
      
 with the MIT Kavli Institute of Astrophysics and Space Research, and it’s one of the coolest things I’ve gotten to do at MIT so far.

The project is involved with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, which is a NASA/MIT-led satellite that monitors and sends pictures of the sky for signs of exoplanets.

One of the methods that scientists use to detect exoplanets is the transit method. When an exoplanet orbits a star and passes in front, it causes the light coming from the star to the Earth to dip, which is a possible sign that there could be an exoplanet in that area.

Sometimes, stray light from the Earth and Moon and reflects off of the lens hood and camera lenses. This is called scattered light, and it can cover up possible signs of exoplanets and other cool space phenomena in TESS’s images.

An example of scattered light in the top right, and a piece of the Milky Way in the bottom left

The project that I joined aims to remove these scattered light effects from the images with the power of machine learning. The ML model is given information about the actual image, as well as TESS’s relative position and orientation to the Earth and Moon, and then gives a prediction of what it thinks the image would look like if the scattered light wasn’t there. Researchers already have ways to remove unwanted noise from light curves, but hopefully this project can show how ML can help preserve the quality of the image data before light curves are generated from them.

Joey, who built up this project for a whole year under the supervision of Dr. Roland Vanderspek and Dr. Daniel Muthukrishna, just graduated and is off to get his PhD. He helped catch me up to speed with the code this summer, from pre-processing data to generating predictions. Luckily the third TESS Science Conference was being held this year, so we got to present a poster! Considering that this was my first conference, and that I got my registration fee waived, I was stoked to go.

My conference name badge, and SPACE PEN

The TESS Science Conference is held every three years, where researchers involved with all aspects of the TESS mission gather and share their research. I met all sorts of people, from undergrads to post-docs, from astronomers to data scientists. I got to talk with people who came from places all over the world, such as Hawaii and Switzerland.

Block schedule (six exoplanet sessions!)

Each day, there were presentation sessions grouped by topic that were hosted in Kresge Auditorium. It was my first introduction to the world of astrophysics. Coming from an EECS background, I had to Google some of the astro-related terms—concepts like hot Jupiters, sub-Neptunes, and asteroseismology, as well as missions like CHEOPS and 
        ARIEL.
      
 Whenever someone who’s well-known in their field came up on stage, Joey leaned over and whispered to me, “That person is a BEAST.”

SPACE POWERPOINT

Who said scientists don’t have a sense of humor?

Either coffee breaks or poster sessions, both of which were hosted in Sala de Puerto Rico of Stud 2, were interspersed throughout the week. Other than how long they were held, they were pretty similar. Posters were displayed throughout the room, and people would grab whatever snacks or coffee were being offered while chatting with people, either explaining their own poster or asking others what their poster is about.

I was intimidated at first to be in a room full of super-smart people. But these sessions soon became one of my most favorite parts of the conference. First of all, the food? Delectable. I definitely took too many lemon-icing pastries.

Joey did almost all of the talking because he’s been with this project for a year, and I’d alternate between standing by the poster and checking out other people’s research, occasionally grabbing an extra raspberry-lime seltzer. When I asked him how he’s so good at public speaking, he said 
        6.UAT
      
 helped him improve, which I’m going to try to take before I graduate.

I also got to talk with people who I never imagined I’d get to interact with. When a NASA researcher came up and asked us about our poster, I got so excited when I saw “SETI Institute” on his badge (“Like from Contact!”) and asked him about what it’s like to work there. I chatted with several astrophysics researchers and asked them questions that have been bouncing around in my head since the start of the conference 
        (“Why do people keep talking about hot Jupiters?”).
      
 I even met two other rising seniors who are majoring in physics and astronomy at Dartmouth, and I got to learn about what their coursework looks like (“Linear algebra also kicked my butt so hard that I had to take it again.”).

This week, it’s back to work. My new model just finished training after an eon as I write this sentence, so I need to add some code to the evaluation/prediction process tonight. But it was really inspiring to hear astro researchers talk about how they could see this UROP project being integrated into exoplanet research.

You could say that this whole experience has been a sweet memory.

Christianity at MIT,Kayode D. '27,4,2024-08-07T00:00:00-04:00,"I’ve been trying to write a blog about Christianity and Cru at MIT for literal months now. Every time I start writing it I feel like I’m not doing it right, and then push it to the backburner. But now this just feels TOO IMPORTANT to NOT share with incoming freshmen that might be interested!

Before I came to MIT, I was often asked by my parents about the Christian groups on campus and churches in the area. I knew next to nothing and would have LOVED a blog about that sort of thing when I was coming in. I knew Cru existed but not much about it, and after coming to after spending a year with the group I would 1000% recommend it to anyone interested in God and staying connected to Christian community.

 

What IS Cru?

Cru is a caring community of individuals committed to sharing the love of Jesus Christ with people on campus. We do tons of events throughout the year to connect students and grow together. We do our weekly meeting on Tuesdays (called Cruesdays) in the student center, and it’s a highlight of my week. It’s a time that I carve out of the chaos of MIT to do no work and hang out with believers and friends. We have speakers come and talk about different topics, and I get to play drums on the worship team. We also do Life Groups, which are small groups outside of Cruesdays where you can grow with a group of people. The people are amazing, the lessons are great, and it has definitely been one of the best things I’ve participated in since coming to MIT. 

 

Christianity and Boston

One of the really cool things we’ve done in the last year has been connecting with other colleges in Boston and their Cru groups. In the fall, we hosted an event called Cru Boston Citywide where we invited students from across Boston to meet up and connect. People from Harvard, Wellesley, Babson, Tufts, (and a bunch of others that I’m probably forgetting) came and hung out at MIT, and we shared testimonies from each school and how the Lord was working on our campuses. I played on the worship team for this event and practiced for like 20 hours leading up to this.

In the fall we also went to a retreat with these students to New Hampshire, and that was ALSO great! A lot more students came to this, and it was here that I found out that MIT has one of the biggest Cru groups of any school in Boston. We had speakers come to talk about Shalom, or the peace of God. 

We do lots of events across Boston is what I’m trying to say. Some students even come from their college to MIT regularly to join us for Cru!

 

Life Groups 

While doing things with the large group of Cru has been great, one of my favorite things has been life groups. People describe life groups as the people that you do life with. You meet up once a week to read the Bible together, ask questions, and learn more about life. It’s usually made up of people from your own or surrounding dorms, but you can really go to any group you want. It’s a great way to get connected to people and grow together. I initially thought that it just sounded like extra work, but it is genuinely so rewarding and fulfilling when you pour into it. It’s great to have that smaller support network, and there’s plenty of groups to attend. A (non-comprehensive) list of life groups includes Athletes in Action, Ignis (focused on the Afro-Caribbean student community but legit anyone’s more than welcome to join), New Vassar, BANANAS (Believers at New and Next and Simmons), and even one dedicated for freshmen!

The freshmen life group has already started doing online meetings on Wednesdays to get to know one another (led by someone you might know 👀), and you can get involved through: cruservants@mit.edu

Cru is also very flexible about creating new or different life groups depending on the need or interest (e.g. we’ve had Big Questions-type groups in the past, where people of any or no faith can gather to talk about the big questions of life and the universe). One of the great things about this fellowship is that it is very student-led, so if there is something you want to start or join then you can definitely take the initiative to do so!

For example, I forget what the motivator was, but me and a few friends who all live in Simmons Hall wanted to start meeting in the mornings to pray and read the Bible together. I’ll admit that I’ve never been good about consistently setting aside time to read my Bible and in the beginning this was a struggle. We wanted to meet at 8 AM (which is earlier than you think) and I had to start going to bed earlier and committing to waking up when I really didn’t want to. I learned so much during these times (Matthew 8:18-22? Crazy!), and it has been a game changer to have people I can grow in faith with. 

 

Reason for God

During IAP we do a series called Reason For God. During this event (and also at various points throughout the year), we have speakers come to MIT and give talks open to the entire community. Anyone who is interested in the topic or has questions can come listen and it’s one of my favorite parts of the year. These people aren’t just random people either. They are professors and scholars and astrophysicists – people who can relate to the thoughts and questions that an MIT student might have. We’ve heard talks on finding proof for the Bible, and the credibility of the Gospels and the Christmas Story, and on the question of whether Christianity is delusional or dangerous. It’s led to some great discussions, and I’ve always looked forward to these talks.

Churches, because I know I wondered

Students in Cru attend a number of churches in the Cambridge and Boston area, and most are either a walk or train/bus ride away. Thankfully, most have multiple services so you don’t have to wake up at the crack of dawn. Groups leave together on Sunday mornings, too, so it’s not as daunting as I initially thought. 

 

To summarize, there is a strong Christian community at MIT and Cru has been my favorite part of it. I am SO ECSTATICALLY PUMPED for this coming semester and to get to meet all of the incoming freshmen if you choose to visit Cru! We’ll have events throughout REX week and the start of the year, and if anyone has any questions about Cru or something relating to MIT, you can feel free to message cruservants@mit.edu or reach me through dada@mit.edu!

feelings from the summer I wish I could describe more accurately,"Alan Z. '23, MEng '24",4,2024-08-05T00:00:00-04:00,"I’ve been living on campus, working on finishing my MEng thesis this summer. It’s been an interesting summer; I’ve really enjoyed being able to put my head down and sort of dig into the work, and although there have been ups and downs, I think it has been, on the whole, a pretty good summer. One thing I’ve noticed this summer is the presence of what I will call Big Feelings™, in the sense that I feel like many of the experiences and emotions I’ve had are actually broken down into these fractally spiraling, smaller thoughts and feelings. Here is my best attempt to describe some of them:

the feeling of accompanying musical theatre rehearsals on piano

a satisfaction in being able to play decently well, surprisingly, after years of not having practiced; a continuous panic to try and reduce the impossibly difficult scores that they give players on Broadway to something you can actually play while still allowing the actors to follow you; the satisfaction of executing that reduction live; the enjoyment of letting the singer lead while you follow them through whatever tempo changes they’d like; the frustration of trying to help read difficult rhythms out to the singer, which is somehow impossible despite your best efforts and years of musical training; the challenge of (or failure to) playing six different vocal lines at once in different octaves; the nice and simple joy of learning new tricks for running rehearsals while being a useful and minimal part of a fun process

the feeling of trying seven different things on your research and having none of them work

a surprisingly common feeling; one that feels like riding a stationary bike, which is, you know, not fun unless you’re into that kind of thing; an increasing sense of desperation as you get closer and closer to the end of the day; a relapse into bad code management, that despite knowing you should individually commit and test each change you make, you just want to get something working and you can unravel it later (you can’t); a questioning about whether you know anything, actually, about what you’re doing; the toxic cocktail of knowing you should step away from your computer and take a walk and try something else later and yet not being able to put things down until you’ve actually made progress; checking the time on your computer and realizing it’s three hours later than you thought it was and you should probably be asleep, but the laptop is so tempting…

a cardinal I saw on campus while leaving work :0

the feeling of buying a discounted membership to a rock climbing gym

a fear from self-knowledge that you’ve never successfully exercised regularly, despite your best efforts; the wondering if you’ve somehow been psychologically scammed by the discount; the calculation about how many times you have to go for it to pay off; the calculation of how many weeks, exactly, you have left in this town; the tentativeness of watching the bill hit your credit card; the excitement of heading to the gym for the first time afterwards and getting a little key tag with a barcode on it

the feeling of revisiting places you’ve seen before, but a long time ago

the nostalgia of spending the Fourth of July in Boston again, of all the memories you’ve had there in years past; the fact that, driving up I-95, you somehow spot all the places you went on during The Long Walk from Maine to Boston, and you also kind of miss that walk despite all the pain it caused you; the fact that you’ve been to Portland three times with friends and have done so few things beyond the art museum and Peaks Island; the knowledge that that art museum is one of your favorites, and, yes, having a “favorite art museum” is incredibly pretentious but the first time you went to Portland you had just discovered you liked art museums at all, and how much we have changed in the past three or four or five years, but the places we visit look the same

the feeling of wearing a hoodie in an air-conditioned building in the summer

a simple feeling: the comfort of being warm in the cold, like cuddling up in a blanket in the winter, but also the annoyance of it being way too cold in the buildings, all the time, when you wish you could just wear a T-shirt and shorts instead

the feeling of making a one-line change to your code which gives you a 30% improvement

the excitement at finally making progress; the frustration that the seven other things you spent twelve hours yesterday on only gave you at most a 10% benefit, but here you are; the forgetting that sometimes you need to take the seven other paths to learn enough to get the progress from that eighth path; the satisfaction of watching runtimes go down; the acceptance that sometimes this is how progress is, plateaus followed by cliffs, and at least the cliffs go up instead of down in this metaphor; the questioning of what amount of improvement will finally be enough for me to feel satisfied with all this work

the feeling of going to a book store and actually buying books

the enjoyment of looking through the things on the shelves, some of which you actually recognize and have a context for; the weird joy of being a poetry snob; the irredeemable desire to own more things that you might not finish reading (though you have finished the last three plays and poetry collections you bought); the wonderment about how people actually find books they didn’t already know about; the adventurous feeling of buying a book you have no context on because it sounds cool, even though you are about as far from adventure as a person can physically be (i.e., the book store), if you subscribe to the conventional definition of adventure; the just sheer joy of walking out into the night, holding three books in your hand like a student; the knowledge that each of these books was individually cheap but together they cost way more than you would have liked; the smell of all the paper, the feel of the texture as you thumb through the side of each book, the sound of the words as you read the first poem aloud: “To the Fig Tree on 9th and Christian…”

some books from the harvard book store

the feeling of going to a rock climbing gym regularly

the satisfaction of having that discounted membership pay off, for some sense of the word; the feeling that this might actually be the one tolerable form of exercise to you, because 1) you’re tall and that’s a “loophole I’m gonna exploit the hell out of” and 2) it’s kind of fun to treat it like puzzle solving; the wondering hesitance of whether this habit is going to last once you move; the knowledge that you should probably also be working on other things as well (cardio); the observation of the incredible things that other people can do with their body that you will still probably never be able to do; the excitement of having a friend to go with who can point out things to do or try and who you can do your best to help as well; the weird social environment of people at so many different skill levels and whether or not to offer/receive unsolicited advice from them; the immense satisfaction of being able to do things you weren’t able to do last time; the feeling of having your forearms puffed up at the end of a session, barely able to hold on to anything anymore; the fear of falling off the wall and the elation in the conquering of that fear

the feeling of signing a lease for the first time

the instant question of “why is this document over sixty pages long”; the fear of missing something in those sixty pages and knowing that this is probably the most important Terms and Conditions that you’ve ever signed; the comfort of knowing that you’re going to have a place to live when you move; the bittersweetness of leaving town, and semi-permanently, knowing how much you’ve grown to love the whole New England vibe, the way the towns and parks and streets have a certain poetry to them; the excitement of starting a new chapter with a friend; the gratitude towards your roommate for managing the whole process and the shame in not contributing as much as you ought to have; the worry that you now have to start actually cleaning your room so that you can move across the country; the wonder about exactly how long you can survive without buying a bed if you already own a couch

the feeling of going to the same Japanese restaurant every Wednesday

the unsettling calculation about how much money, exactly, you’ve spent at this place; the shame and pride that the waitress now recognizes you and doesn’t even wait for you to sit down before she’s placed your order (which is always the same); the awareness that you only have one more Wednesday left before you’ll have to wait months to go to this place again; the overwhelming love you have for their food because it just brings you comfort in a way that food has scarcely ever done; the fact that it almost made you cry once; the freedom of having a schedule where you can, in fact, take the train three stops to eat at a restaurant on a weekday; the fact that no matter how many times you have the pork cutlet curry, it always reminds you of your freshman year, making curry with strangers in an East Campus kitchen, feeling truly at home and welcome at MIT for the first or second time

the feeling of watching your friends play League of Legends

the disappointment in yourself for actually knowing things about this game, now; the unsolicited opinions about the gameplay that you now have and which try to keep to yourself; the elation of watching your friends win and the uncertainty of the in-between moments where it feels like it’s inevitable that one team will lose, but it takes another twenty or thirty minutes for that to happen or sometimes they mount a comeback; the weird feeling that you could never really commit that much time to playing games but you spend just as much time on YouTube if not more; the mild shame that right now the only video game you’re playing is Minecraft, where all you’re doing is digging out a 16×16 hole and then filling it with dirt, which is surely even less productive; the joy in just getting to spend time with friends, even if it’s online, watching them play a game, because they still play the game in subtle ways that match their personality, which is what made you friends with them in the first place

the feeling of understanding something more deeply than you ever have before

the feeling of looking at a problem in your head like mentally visualizing all the nooks and crannies of your own room; the satisfaction of being able to spin that system around in your head despite that phrase not really having semantic meaning; the shame of knowing there are still corners of this algorithm you have treated as a kind of “black box” even though you have already unraveled so many layers of this particular onion; the calmness that you imagine from someone meditating at the bottom of the pool, the heavy and fruitful waters of knowledge gently splashing above you

the feeling of playing in a pit orchestra again after two years of conducting

the joy of following a conductor again; the comfort in knowing that, no matter how lost you are, you can always find the downbeat at the podium; the re-invigorated section leader instincts to breathe in and lift your head before entrances despite the fact that you are playing piano, not violin, and there is nobody else in your section; the uncomfortable fact that you aren’t watching the conductor quite as much as you would like a player to be watching the conductor if you were conducting; the feeling that music is so much more collaborative than you remember it being, and that somehow you know things now, funnily enough, between helping with sound equipment and knowing what the parts of a drum kit are and baton management; the thought that maybe you should start a band some time, because this is just plain fun, making music with friends, but that is perhaps a dream for a later you with more time and practice

the feeling of having people mention your writing to you in a non-writing context

the mortifying ordeal of being known; the excitement that “somebody actually reads all this junk I make”; the genuine heart-warming of people liking it, especially people who you know (through virtue of the context) are much more intelligent than you; the wonder about what writing you’re going to do next and who will see it, and whether you need to live more to be able to write more, and “what does that even mean, anyways?”; the reminder that your writing is important and impactful, writing is important and impactful (it is important and impactful)

the feeling of loving and knowing many things

(but also not knowing many more things); the feeling that “I’m so lucky to have all this,” to be decent or maybe good or at least okay at computer systems/architecture, and writing, and music, to varying levels, but certainly to love doing all of them so much; the fear that I will let the desire to be good overtake the enjoyment of it; the sadness about all the things I could’ve learned more about but never got the chance or time to, like chemistry and biology, all the branches pruned off the tree of possible paths; but, man, I am so happy to be who I am and to have learned so much and to have so much more to learn, and so soon (but I do have to finish this thesis)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240719_224022270-EDIT-1-1000x750.jpg

Home is where the Heart is,Anika H. '26,5,2024-08-04T00:00:00-04:00,"Featuring my sister’s drawings cuz she’s awesome.

 

I went to China for the first time in 6 years this summer. Although 9th grade of high school didn’t feel all that long ago, I could only remember a few blurry memories of restaurants, relatives, and a zoo.

I flew over to California a Monday afternoon and stayed there with my family for a day before heading out together for China the next morning. While I packed pretty light, bringing just a few clothes for the week, we brought 8 suitcases in total, many filled to the brim with gifts for our relatives. When mom couldn’t fit everything, my suitcase was eventually used as overflow. We hauled ourselves and our bags onto the 14 hour flight. The best part was that not many people took this flight, and nearly everyone on the plane got an entire 3 or 4 seat row to themselves. My sister, parents, and I all took turns entertaining my little brother, and somehow, I managed to get him to sleep for an hour or so. Exhausted and jetlagged, we then caught a train, and got picked up by an auntie to go to my grandparents’ house in Fuxin, a small city in the Liaoning Province of China.

My grandparents have gotten visibly older and weaker, and it sucks seeing them like this, knowing that they’re only gonna get older. Grandpa’s gone deaf, and grandma needs help walking now. They raised me since I was born and stayed in the US with us until I was 14. The last time I visited them was in the 9th grade of high school, so I was super excited to see them again.

We got visits from relatives, many many many relatives. So many relatives I don’t even remember how they’re related to us anymore. I’m just going to refer to them as uncles, aunties, and cousins for the rest of this blog.



The first few days, it felt a little awkward getting back into the habit of speaking Mandarin. My vocabulary was more lacking since the last time I last went, and I had a very slight, albeit audible American accent. Despite being guests ourselves, we spent a lot of time entertaining the other relatives that all decided to meet up at the same time.

One of the aunties that lived in the area tried to take us clothes shopping, and with my sister and I being socially awkward nerds in another country, we just ended up trying on weird outfits at the behest of the employees. I caught my sister throwing them some bombastic side eyes for their tastes in fashion, and I had to briefly excuse myself to snicker off to the side where they couldn’t hear.

The next few times we went shopping were a lot more casual. I ended up learning *fashion* from my sister and getting styled up in clothing stores. She thinks I look better in oversize clothes. Everything is ridiculously cheap. For maybe the price of a weeks worth of groceries, we got two massive bags of clothes and shoes, totaling around 60 items. I think we did an entire year’s worth of clothes-shopping that day. Besides that, I found it really funny that the stores had NKTE and NZEK shoes. They stocked Daidsa instead of Adidas, and ENT RONEH TACE instead of THE NORTH FACE. I had a ton of fun snapping photos of off-brand names.



my sister dreaming up an outfit for me

While I could engage in polite conversation with our relatives and my sister was hiding from human interaction, my little brother was having a blast, making friends left and right. It was quite the scene watching my little brother harass a distant cousin and playfight him until the poor guy was out of breath. Between our cousin threatening to toss him off a bridge and simultaneously begging for mercy, I had to intervene at times for the sake of my brother’s safety and our cousin’s sanity.

my cousin carrying my little brother like a sack of potatoes

Every morning, grandpa and I would get up early to go to the breakfast market. There were people selling fish and fresh meats, steamed corn and tofu soup, fresh fruit, steamed buns and desserts galore. In other words, all the flavorful food and groceries you can’t find in the US for dirt cheap. Then again, I’m biased towards Asian cuisine. The cost of a batch of tofu soup for 5 people is less than that of a bag of chips in a Boston vending machine.



For 3 days in a row, I helped my grandpa haul a giant watermelon across the entire market and up 6 flights of stairs because there’s no elevator. Grandpa’s quite fit for his age, but he’s 90 and his age is catching up to him, and his legs aren’t getting him anywhere with that watermelon. When we got back, he told my parents that I was pretty much as reliable as a son, which made me very happy because that’s high high praise coming from an Asian grandpa.



We ate out at restaurants with family style meals and spinning center tables. Unlike the US, where everyone orders their own dish, people order a bunch of food to taste and share together. The entrees were mouthwatering to say the least. The two times we went, I ate until I had no space left for dessert.

As we were living there, I helped bring grandma food, trim her fingernails, carry things up the stairs for my grandpa, and do other little things around the house. It felt nice to be depended on. Whenever they told me that I’ve grown, I became more acutely aware of my future responsibility to my family.



I didn’t know enough engineering vocabulary to tell grandpa in detail what I was learning in school or tell grandma about the fun community I found, but I knew enough to let them know I was doing an internship, excited about learning, and generally doing pretty well. Grandpa looked really proud every time a neighbor asked if I was his grandkid, gloating about how I just came back from the US. He kept trying to buy us more popsicles.

Grandma can’t go down the stairs, but we were more than happy to hang out with each other inside the house. I showed her my fire spinning videos, and she kept asking me whether I had a boyfriend yet. Then I hear grandma’s cousin tell my 9 year old little brother that he should find four wives when he grows up. There’s a bit of a cultural disconnect, but I see they care for us all the same.



 

 

by the way, my sister’s actually really good at art.

my STORY of helping Wyoming students shoot for the STARS,Nicole Cooper,0,2024-07-31T00:00:00-04:00,"Peep the Grand Tetons

This spring, I had the chance to reconnect with my rural Wyoming roots through my work at MIT. As someone who has made the journey from a rural upbringing to working at selective institutions, I often wondered how to give back.

In Fall 2023, I joined the inaugural STORY (Small Town Outreach Recruitment and Yield) Trip, which took us through Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa.

We visited the Old Spanish Caves in Arkansas! (I know that looks like a big bat but it’s me!)

This spring, we traveled to New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and my home state of Wyoming. I was thrilled to join the planning team and attend the second trip, especially after enjoying the first one so much. As the lead planner for the Wyoming stop, I was excited to bring the college fair experience back home to students who might never get the chance to visit institutions outside of their home state. 

Planning the 5 stop college fair was a whirlwind but so satisfying. Teaming up with folks from Rice, Yale, USC, Barnard, and Case Western, we dove into every detail together. From reserving space to host students, sending out invites, and developing content to present, to even renting cars and purchasing plane tickets—we had so much to do! This was especially challenging during the busiest time of the year, when each of us had many competing priorities. Coordinating across different institutions and time zones wasn’t easy, but it was totally worth it. We connected with the STARS (Small Town and Rural Students) College Network and managed to both plan and execute a five-state/25+ institution traveling college fair through rural America!

We got up at about 5 am to drive to Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park!

Traveling in a van with reps from Harvard, UChicago, and Rice, we shared laughs, explored new places, and tried local cuisine. Beyond the college fairs, the hours spent on the highway turned out to be quite a highlight; one of the best parts of road tripping through small-town America is learning about the culture and eating at local restaurants. We ate some of the best New Mexican Food at Jerry’s Cafe in Gallup, drove through Navajo National Monument and were awed by its vast landscape and rock formations, learned about the history of potatoes at the Potato Museum in Idaho, and finished out with the breathtaking (and cloudy) views of Grand Teton National Park.

While we appreciated the beauty of the rural American West, the real magic happened in the connections we made—with each other, with students, with counselors, and with local communities. We aimed to show them that they can seek amazing opportunities outside their hometowns and return with fresh perspectives. Seeing the students’ excitement in realizing their potential, which is beyond what they had when they first walked through the doors, and receiving heartfelt thanks from high school counselors, inspires us all to continue the work that we do.

Ending the trip in Wyoming was particularly special for me. Jackson Hole High School was gracious to host us, and as the school counselor handed me the microphone after her warm welcome I was in awe seeing the room was packed—filled with over 300 students and guests from over 200 miles all across Wyoming, here for what they called “a once in a lifetime opportunity to speak with so many institutions.” Thanks to the efforts of the planning team, the University of Wyoming (Go Pokes!) and Jackson Hole High School, we put on what (we think!) was the largest college fair in Wyoming history, and the highest attended event of the trip—no small feat for the least-populated state!

Admissions officers from all over the country visit Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and spoke to over 300 students and guests! Ofc we had to get a group photo

Speaking to all of these incredible rural students from my home state was both nerve-wracking and incredibly fulfilling. The students’ reactions to having 25 institutions visit their state reminded me just how personal and significant my job is. The students were beyond grateful for the chance to connect with universities from all over the country and felt that this event opened doors they hadn’t even imagined existed. I totally understand where they’re coming from. Growing up on a farm in rural Wyoming, college felt like a distant dream, and every step of the process was a daunting challenge that consistently felt unreachable.

Rural students still face significant access barriers to higher education. After all, it’s easy to feel discouraged when the nearest institution is a four-hour drive from home (through the mountains, I might add), and the closest Ivy+ institution is a ten-hour journey away—if not more! Seeing their excitement and hope for the future reminds me why this work is so important. It’s about making dreams feel attainable and helping students discover a world of possibilities and opportunities they didn’t know existed. We will continue to highlight their unique talents and bring knowledge of opportunities to rural America with trips to small towns every fall and spring.

After the event, I reunited with an old teacher of mine who had driven five students from my old high school three hours through a snowstorm just to attend the college fair. In his words, ‘An opportunity like this doesn’t happen in Wyoming.’ Thanks to STORY and STARS, now it does.

A Summer in DC,Jessica Z. '27,4,2024-07-30T00:00:00-04:00,"Happy
        middle of
      
July! I haven’t blogged in a long time, and I have quite a few posts from the end of the school year that I still need to revisit. As Kano mentioned in her blog post, I’m also trying to make a more conscious effort to catch up with blogging to my current life, but words are hard. Nothing’s quite surfaced yet :’)

That being said, I’m working in Washington, DC this summer through the MIT-Washington Summer Internship Program! I’ve been to DC three times before this summer: once on a middle school field trip, for three days last summer, and for a week during spring break as part of MIT-Washington’s orientation.

I took my last final in the Spring and was soon whisked away on an airplane to land in DC. I’m working at a biomedical and public health organization this summer, which has definitely been a unique experience that calls for its own blog post. Outside of work, though, the MIT-Washington Program and all the interesting spots in DC have given me a good chance to explore the DMV area!

Here’s some things I’ve been up to:

 

Congressional Baseball Game

The Congressional Baseball Game is held in Nationals Park every summer in mid-June! If you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a bipartisan baseball game played by members of the United States Congress. I’ve never been to a baseball game before, but it was a very chill day :)

 

Georgetown Flea Market

Every Sunday, Georgetown has a Flea Market with vendors selling a mix of vintage, modern, hand-made, and revamped goods. It reminds me of the Fenway Flea in Boston but with a bit more jewelry and artistic goods. I went nearly every Sunday just because each week brought something new. I ended up buying a few pieces of jewelry, one of which was from a local seller who I ended up talking to for a bit about how he became interested in jewelry making. It was very wholesome, and he gave me a few tips on how to get started with jewelry making!

 

Site Visits

The MIT-Washington program organizes weekly visits to policy-related organizations in DC, ranging from smaller think tanks, to non-profits, to large government organizations. Oftentimes, the speakers are MIT alumni, and it’s been interesting to talk to past students about
        their winding paths into policy.
      


We’ve been able to learn about a lot of different fields: AI ethics, biotechnology, agricultural policy, international relations, foreign affairs, economics, etc. I admittedly came in pretty solely interested in healthcare or public health policy, but I’ve left every event with a little bit more knowledge about just how vast the policy world is. Here’s some of my favorite sites:

 

MIT Community Dinner Party

I’ve been going to a lot of food places, both with the MIT-Washington program and with other friends staying in DC this Summer. My favorite food experience, though, was when we were invited to Kat Jiang’s house for a dinner party!

Kat (@chefkatdc) is an
        MIT alum
      
and one of the coolest people I’ve been able to meet. She was super involved in the
        UA
      
 and East Campus, and she pivoted to culinary school a few years after graduating. She’s a pastry cook at Seylou Bakery, chef instructor at Cookology Culinary School, and has made it a hobby to host amazing themed dinner parties :)

Lightning round of some other fun DC things:
        museums,
      
        4th of July fireworks,
      
Smithsonian Zoo,lots of bakeries, botanical gardens, DC food festival, water lily festival, and visiting new & old friends.

I’m
        not usually a fan of the summer,
      
but this summer has passed by
        so quickly.
      
I came into this summer quite stressed, so it’s been a kind reminder to me on how important it is to rest.

It’s a nice change of environment and pace—I’m not at school, I’m not at home, and it’s strangely comforting to try new things this summer. I’m also trying a
        new type of work
      
this summer, which has helped bring back more of my spark for learning.

I’ve been thinking a lot more about growing up since I primarily work with people who are many years older than me in education and life experience. Nearly every time I’ve talked to someone, they always wistfully mention that I should really savor my time in undergrad. I’ve heard this before, of course, but I think it really started to sink in this summer.

After my housing ends in early August, I’m heading home for two weeks before flying back to Boston to see friends and get ready for the next school year. A lot of first-year-like jitters have crept into my head, despite finishing my first-year, and I have a feeling it will feel like a new beginning again. I’m not usually a fan of change, but I’m excited, and I’m grateful that I’ve been able to spend this summer in DC <3","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0522-800x533.jpeg

My Product Design Internship in Austin,Emiko P. '25,6,2024-07-26T00:00:00-04:00,"Boy oh boy, what a summer it’s been so far. For the first time in my college career, I’m spending my summer working in 
        the United States
      
 – and where better to breathe in that sweet, American, summer air than in Austin, Texas? The land of cowboy boots, sweltering heat, and a city that took me no less than a week to fall in love with.

Austin is on top of an aquifer, meaning that it has a ton of rivers, lakes, and springs dotted all around the city. The one I frequent the most is called Barton Springs. It’s a sloping grassy hill that bottoms out into a narrow, deep river. It has an amazing view of Downtown Austin’s silver skyline, which looms beyond the dense trees crowding the river and parks. The spring is cold enough that I have to hype myself up to jump in. The initial plunge is an icy shock, like your eyes flying open and your body bolting awake after an all-too-realistic dream, but once you get used to it, the cool water washes the Austin heat away, and it becomes pretty soothing.

My roommate for the summer, 
        Ottavia P. ‘25
      
, and I often go together. We bob around in the water for a bit, clamber up the slopes to read a 
        book
      
, get all overheated in the UV that is surely at least 13, then jump in all over again. 

One thing is always certain after spending an afternoon at the springs: you’re gonna be starving. Good thing Austin knows how to satisfy! I’ve tried juicy birria style tacos, thick Tex-Mex queso, and a burger from a Michelin star rated food truck that only sells one thing: Not A Damn Chance (NADC) Burger. I’ve eaten pizza slices the size of my face after a comedy show, tacos upon tacos after a night out on 6th street with the other MIT kids working in Austin this summer, and Vietnamese rice bowls with my coworkers. But not only have I been upping my foodie game this summer, I’ve also been upping my chef game.

Armed with some Airbnb-provided pots and pans, an air fryer, a trusty Zojirushi rice cooker, and an addiction to 
        HEB
      
, I have transformed from a helpless, microwave-dependent college student to a burgeoning rival to Gordon Ramsay. My easy go-to’s are the following, in case anyone needs some inspo:

- Salmon, rice, and sauteed mushrooms in soy sauce.

- 
        Chicken
      
, rice, and roasted green beans and broccoli.

- Those swirly pasta noodles, diced tomatoes, corn, 
        tuna
      
, all 
        drizzled in olive oil
      
.

I’ve been playing with a WPSL team this summer called Austin Rise, which is a semi-pro team. I have practice three times a week, so I always come home ravenous. There’s nothing better than scarfing down a home-made dinner while watching an episode of Ted Lasso with my roommate. We started the first season at the beginning of the summer and are about to finish 
        season three soon
      
.

And that’s life so far in Austin! It’s full of parks, rivers, new friends, cowboy boots (yes, of course I got some), wide open spaces, smiling strangers, and a good amount of traffic.

But that’s not all. I may be frolicking about Austin quite a bit, but I’m also working!

This summer, I’m doing an internship with a company called M3 Design, a product design and development consultancy. It’s a team of about 30 people that houses an industrial design team and a mechanical engineering team, as well as business and marketing teams. I’m on the mechanical engineering team as an intern! This company helps clients with any step of the product design process, which could be concept development, prototyping, strategy, user research, mechanical and electrical architecture, or design for manufacturing.

Usually focusing on medical, lifestyle, and commercial products, their clients range from medical giants to visionary startups. This means that some projects can take anywhere from five months to five years to complete. Since I started in early June, I’ve been put on six different projects. One of them is my intern project, where I am building a small, portable light that bridges the gap between convenience and luxury. This project has been a sprint from the beginning, and I have learned so much. 

Don’t get me wrong, though, the start of a road to learning something new is always bumpy. Learning SolidWorks as a beginner from one of my mentors had me feeling like a kid learning to ride a bike for the first time. I was wobbling, even toppling over at times (Press this button here… No, not that one, the other one!). But over the course of my first week or so, I found my balance, settled my feet on the pedals – right foot, left foot – and slowly started to bike. Now, eight weeks later, I can hop on the bike, and it takes me most places I want. I still swerve a bit at times (Why aren’t these two parts connecting the way I want?), or I make some wrong turns (Uh… I think I forgot to save that part before I closed out), but I’ve learned how to right myself, to backtrack, to solve problems, and to continue on my way.

I’ve learned other skills, too, like how to do proper user need analysis to figure out what features a customer actually cares about. I’ve made little prototypes out of foam, then later 3D printed them. I’ve learned how to incorporate electronics, how to work with manufacturers, and how to make sure the thing I’m designing on my screen can actually be manufactured in real-life. My time at M3 Design has nurtured that little kernel in my brain that’s always asking why.

For example: 

Why do I have to squeeze my detergent bottle cap like this to twist it off?

Hm, probably so the cap isn’t easily removed by little kids.

Why is my car key shaped so funky?

Oh, look, when you curl your hand around it, it fits perfectly.

How does this battery cover stay locked in without screws?

Aha! Because a little part of it hooks and wedges itself in. You know… I may incorporate that into my own project.

There’s something powerful in self-sufficiency and confidence – in knowing that you have the skills, or at least the knowledge of how to acquire them, to give a project a shot. M3 Design has gifted me a taste of that feeling. It’s like they’ve given me the materials, the wood, to start building a house.

And what’s funny is that, if M3 Design has given me the wood, then MIT has given me the screws, or the fasteners, to put it all together. 

For example:

I need to see if this pin will be able to handle this much force on it.

Go back to your 
        2.001
      
 notes and find the beam bending equations.

How can we try and make the lights dim?

Maybe we can use PWM. I learned that in 
        2.004
      
. I also can use what I remember from 
        6.0001
      
 to code that.

How many hours is this battery going to last us?

I took 
        2.678
      
, I can figure that out.

With the real-life experience of M3 Design (along with all my past internships), and the theoretical knowledge of MIT filling in the gaps, I’ve built something incredible: a foundation. I can say that I have a solid foundation as an engineer, a steady base that I can continue to build on and grow as I pursue what I want in the future.

Upon this foundation, I may add the creativity of a product designer, the tenacity of a flight operations engineer, the guidance of a leader, the dreams of a writer, the logic of a researcher, and who knows what else. Sky’s the limit.

What’s important for you to remember is that this foundation was built from scratch, starting my freshman year at MIT. I did not come into college knowing what I wanted to major in or what skills I wanted to gain. All I had was my ferocious desire to learn – and it’s incredible what that and a healthy dose of determination can amount to. 

So, don’t be afraid to dive into an unknown world, because before you know it, you will have built the foundation that a million different futures can rest upon.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aus_2-400x205.png,1
I Hate Superman.,Kayode D. '27,9,2024-07-16T00:00:00-04:00,"I never liked Superman.

I thought he was too idyllic. 

If you asked someone what superpower they’d want, they’d probably say strength, or speed, or flying, or something like that. Someone might come up with a more unique power, like density control, or to control friction, or to forget things. But if someone told you that they’d have flight AND strength AND invulnerability AND heat vision AND frost breath AND … AND … AND… You’d call them crazy! Oh, they have no weakness, except for a rock that you can’t find on earth. I’d laugh if someone told me this is the power they’d want. He’s much too powerful, it’s like he’s cheating! He could beat almost any other superhero just by looking at them. I thought he was stupid. 

During the Great Depression, he was born out of a need for a hero. But I can’t help but feel like he became a propaganda tool. Used to support the U.S., yes, but ultimately an unbeatable character that was over commercialized and pumped into by big corporations. I thought he seemed like a Boomer’s superhero, where they needed an underdog in someone like Superman, but now he is this behemoth titan hanging over all the weaker, new heroes of today. Think about it: for the last nearly 100 years Superman has been THE superhero. How many new heroes and stories have missed their chance to flourish because of Superman’s control of comic and superhero media? What about 
        Speedball
      
? I bet you don’t know who that is. Or 
        Dennis Sykes
      
? What about 
        Detective Chimp
      
? Why haven’t we seen more stuff about these characters with equally interesting stories? If Superman wasn’t so over milked then maybe other lesser known heroes could get a shot. 

The only comic I had read of Superman that I remember actually enjoying was the Superman Doomsday: Death of Superman comics. It’s ironic: I liked him best when he could actually die. 



I never liked Superman.

…

I started running recently.  

I came home from college having all these plans for how I would grow so much during these months at home. I’d have a job, I’d make lots of music, and I’d blog all the time, I thought. But this is hard. It’s hard to create a coherent thought for an entire blog post. Especially with the never ending, ever expanding existence of social media. I could go on (another) ten page rant about social media and the Erosion of Deep Literacy and my opinion on it all. It’s only getting more and more difficult to get out of it. We are literally fighting an algorithm designed to keep a chokehold on our attention, and it’s an uphill, losing battle. Day by day it only gets harder and harder to focus and ignore the distraction. It’s so easy to take the path of least resistance to get entertainment, and avoid monotony or boredom with music or scrolling or anything. I don’t think I’ve driven more than 2 hours in my entire life without listening to music. Is that bad? I don’t know. I just know that I’d rather not be alone with my own thoughts, so I listen to music to avoid it. I feel trapped. 

My brother is jacked. Coming home and seeing him made me want to improve myself so I wouldn’t look so pale in comparison to him. At first I hated running, but I enjoy it now. I’ve created a 
        habit
      
 of running every night when it gets cooler, and I always borrow 
        my brother’s airpods
      
 to listen to music. One day, I was sick of feeling like I had to have a distraction to exist, and I was tired of being afraid of being bored. I didn’t take the airpods and ran without them. 

I had been tossing around the idea of hating superman for a few days at this point. I thought about the way he looked in the justice league movie – a movie i haven’t watched except in passing. He was beating the Justice League on his own. He was one wrong move away from being a villain. He felt too powerful, too upright and just, too much. 

As I thought about this, I ran over the hill in my neighborhood, and saw the sky above. It was 
        awe inspiring
      
. I don’t know if the sky had ever looked like that at MIT, or if I’ve just never cared enough to look.  I was always too busy distracting myself from being bored by work or the lack of it. At that moment, I wished that I could just jump over all the houses and see above the clouds. I wished that I wasn’t so tired from running. I wished that I was Superman. 



It was at that moment that I realized that I don’t hate Superman; I was jealous. I am jealous. I wish that I was Superman. I wish that I was as strong as him and I had a purpose and I didn’t feel pain or weakness. I wish I could do what he does and fly up into the sky and see the earth from his point of view.  wish I was Superman.

…

I started watching My Adventures with Superman. This show is awesome! It portrays Superman not as the hundred-year-old behemoth I had pictured in my mind, but as a young adult who was unsure of himself, and is still figuring out how to be not only Superman, but also Clark Kent. He is actually a person that struggles with things like everyone else: With his powers and his relationships, and with becoming the person that he wants to be. He’s not too strong or a boomer’s superhero. He’s awesome. 

I didn’t like Superman, but I never really got to know him. My opinion was based on the little bit that I had seen, and the image I had made in my mind. And even the one thing I actually dug into, the Death of Superman comic, I thought was incredible! I didn’t even give him a chance, and I never went back to learn the life of Superman. He came from a small town in Kansas, living on a farm with a humble beginning. He had a weight on his shoulders, the weight of the literal world. Sure, he’s a titan, but he’s also Clark Kent, reporter for the daily planet. And I didn’t take the time to learn who Clark was. 

Now when I think about Superman, I don’t think of the titan or the behemoth or the monster, I think of this panel. 

There really are a lot of super things about Superman.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-16-185723.png

happy mid-summer

 



 

so, lately, I’ve been in a bit of writing rut

but, as I was reading through an email I sent out to my friends, I thought: oh! this would be a cute blog

so that’s what I’m copying and pasting below

Oh, take this veil from off my eyes My burning sun will, some day, rise So what am I gonna be doin’ for a while? —Lana Del Rey, Doin’ Time

 

I’ve been having summertime thoughts accompanied by summertime music

 

Between my summers, I’ve lived such different lives: sad girl sulk in Boston, wanderlusty adventures in Europe, and domestic comfort in Austin

 

anyways

 

Things I’ve been meaning to share:

Domestication

- Life has been weirdly easy. I work 9-5, hit the gym, eat dinner, and have the rest of the evening to myself. Suspiciously chill these days, for the most part.

- Dancing in the morning is really fun.

- I’ve been so healthy, and have recognized how much harder it is to maintain healthy habits during the school year. I’ll miss the ease of wellness when the fall term comes around, but I know I’d prefer relishing in the academic chaos over taking things slow, at least for a little bit. Watch me eat my words in a few months time.

- I love being on my own two feet. Having my own place and car. My schedule is fully my own.

- I’m excited to host people this summer. Thank you to everyone who’s already swung by and everyone else to come. If you also want to visit me, let me know.

Food

- I don’t love the activity of cooking. Like, I can enjoy it, but I do it more for the end than the means. Given the choice of someone cooking for me or I cook, I’d almost always prefer someone else. I kinda wish I actually liked it. Life would be a little easier. If I’m cooking with someone, that’s different. Then, I really like it, which is something I’ve only recently realized.


- If I’m cooking with someone, that’s different. Then, I really like it, which is something I’ve only recently realized.

- Fresh fruit feels like such a gift from the world.

Style

- I love big, flowy clothing for the summer. Maybe this liking is partly derived from Thai culture, where thin, breezy linen rules supreme.

- My style has evolved so much. I was a burst of bright, vibrant colors freshman year. I’ve transitioned into elevated neutrals accompanied by a touch of fun (i.e. a statement piece).

Family

- I’m really proud of how far my family life has come. I’ve worked hard to rebuild bridges and heal old wounds. We’re happy to see each other, and that’s all I could really ask for.

Self-perception

- I feel old. I always have, but I thought my perception of age and actual age would’ve matched up by now.

- I feel behind. I have a lot of tasks backlogged. They’re tucked away between a Notion page and TickTick list. Oomf. I need to get on that. I know I’m on top of the things that I need to be on top of, but I still worry about accidentally forgetting to do things. I almost have everything squared away, so the prospect of being recalibrated (projected to be by mid-July) excites me.

School

- Throughout June, random MIT extracurricular shit kept coming up: The East Campus Fort was launched into legal, insurance, and EHS issues—all of which we, unfortunately, got the shorter end of the stick on. We’ll still build a really cool fort, but it’s sad to see much of our work be brushed aside. I also found out that, due to my arrival date, I’ll never actually help physically build nor see the fully-built fort, which sucks. But, I’ll live vicariously through the party-attendees and I’ve luckily gone to and helped build for every party preceding this one, so there’s not too much lost. My mech-e research abstract was a lot of work. The Simmons Gov team had to deal with 
        [redacted]
      
Engineers Without Borders is working over the summer and I had to whip up a CAD. It took more time than I had anticipated. And other, smaller things, but still things. July is looking less occupied by tasks of these sorts, so that’s good.

- I haven’t blogged in awhile and feel bad about it. There’s much I want to share, but words are hard. I’ve tried drafting but nothing has landed yet. Some things I’ve been meaning to blog: Travel: Peru, South Africa/Botswana, United Kingdom Personal: being FLI, eulogy to my water bottle, taking a gap/leave Activities: being a participant in random studies, 3D printing my brain, my current UROP, fire spinning


- Travel: Peru, South Africa/Botswana, United Kingdom

- Personal: being FLI, eulogy to my water bottle, taking a gap/leave

- Activities: being a participant in random studies, 3D printing my brain, my current UROP, fire spinning

Media

- I’m very worried about this presidential cycle.

- Playing the New York Times games every morning with the 
        chaos table
      
has been fun.

- At the start of this summer, I rejoined Instagram to connect with other fire spinners, but I’ve lingered since then, and I don’t really like it. Perhaps it’s time to oust myself again.

Annual Events

- Last year, I celebrated the Fourth of July by tossing tea into the nearest body of water. This was extra funny because I was in the UK and was made fun of all day as the ~American Intern~. This year, it was very hard to find a body of water in 
        Las Vegas,
      
 so I tossed the cold half of my previously-hot tea into my kitchen sink. I guess it’s the thought that counts.

- I’m proud of the gifts I got my mom for her 50th birthday (a few days ago): I flew to visit her, got her the 50th anniversary edition of UNO (her favorite card game), a trinity of her favorite cake flavors, and a few other things. 
        Khomchan
      
also did a great job with his gifts. She seemed very pleased.

okay

I’m searching for songs about the liminality of summer. If you have any, I’d appreciate recommendations.

All the 2024 i3 videos megapost,Chris Peterson SM '13,1,2024-07-12T00:00:00-04:00,"As a part of MIT’s unconventional housing assignment process, rising first years typically consult MIT guide to residences while choosing where to live. This guide includes the Interactive Introduction to the Institute (I3) videos, which are produced by students to show off their life and culture of their residence halls. In the ’90s and early ’00s, these were recorded to VHS tapes, and later DVDs, and mailed to adMITs, but with the advent of YouTube/Vimeo/etc they are now posted online (alongside tours!).

Be a Blogger 2024!,Ceri R. '16,2,2024-07-01T00:00:00-04:00,"Petey had a mighty nine-year run of writing this post, but a king [of the internet]’s time as ruler rises and falls like the Sun, so now it’s my turn to take up the mantle of “person who announces the admissions blogger application.” While some days I’m in Cambridge at the MIT Welcome Center, most of my summer is spent in Framingham, where:

- I go on my silly little mental health walks, sometimes to dog-watch in local parks, sometimes to get 
        an açaí tradicional,
      
 and sometimes to 
        walk my boys
      


- the Commuter Rail is on its summer schedule and people are going on vacations, which means the trains are slightly less crowded as I make my trek to campus (but still packed when there’s an event in Boston, like the Celtics parading on duck boats)

- it’s time for anyone who’s interested in blogging to share your writing and let us perceive you, as though you were a shy yet wondrous deep sea octopus

Cephalopods aside, here’s what it means to us to be an admissions blogger:

MIT students are the Institute’s best ambassadors and community-builders. Admissions Officers (AOs) can explain complicated processes and provide words of wisdom, but we can’t write about what it’s like to experience Interphase EDGE/x, or live on Conner 2, or host an adMIT for Sin LíMITe, or UROP, or become a mentor for Project Manus, or learn a cool new thing in class, and so forth. The mission of the blogs is to help our students communicate what MIT is actually like. We do this by hiring students who have good judgment, a compelling voice and perspective, and the disciplined exuberance to post at least twice a month on average. We may ask you to help advise creative projects in the office and serve as a touchstone for student culture. We pay you for this work. It’s a pretty good gig, to be honest. This application was designed mostly by student bloggers to help ask and answer the kinds of questions that might be useful for identifying their kin. Your submissions will be read by a small committee made up of AOs, senior bloggers, and a few blogger cruft. Please note that *only* current MIT students may apply to be bloggers (i.e. no prospective students or students at other colleges). This application is open to all MIT undergraduates of any class year. This application will go live on 07/01/2024 and close on 08/01/2024. Anyone who has started their application by 08/01/2024 will have a grace period of 7 days to complete and submit it. We will begin reviewing complete applications after the application has closed, and we hope to select and alert bloggers before orientation if possible.

Becoming a Mad Scientist,Emiko P. '25,0,2024-06-24T00:00:00-04:00,"Have you ever wanted to see how accurate you can make a GPS? Have you ever wanted to see just how hot your PC can get before it starts messing with its performance? What about designing your own heat sink? Or maybe figuring out the optimal scoop-ability of your favorite 
        ice cream
      
? What about the power of nerf gun bullets? Or maybe the power of a single footstep? Want to know the correlation between music and your lifting workouts?

These questions that bounce around our brain are fun to think about – but imagine if you had an entire semester to pursue that question by designing an experiment, collecting and analyzing data, and uncovering a conclusion. Sounds nerdy, but… also weirdly exciting? 

This is 2.671, Measurements and Instrumentation, a communication-intensive class I took this past spring where we have a semester to pursue any research question we can imagine. This is a particularly special class because it is required for everyone majoring in Mechanical Engineering – which means that, after going our separate ways and taking different MechE classes the past two years, my classmates and I all converged again for this one class. Walking into lecture the first day was an Avengers Endgame moment, seeing the large group of familiar faces all assembled and ready to take on one of the most notoriously demanding classes. 

We got right into it, and by the first week, we were brainstorming the research projects we would be working on for the rest of the semester. It didn’t take me very long to figure out what my project would be. When I got concussed my sophomore season and was returning to play soccer, I asked the doctor if I should wear a concussion prevention headband. It’s basically a foam headband that a lot of soccer players wear after getting concussed to prevent a reinjury. He told me, “Up to you, I’m not entirely sure if they work.” And thus, my 2.671 project was born! 

I wanted to see if these headbands would actually absorb the impact of soccer balls as advertised and if they were to be trusted with a soccer player’s brain safety. I ended up
        simulating a concussion
      
 and testing the headbands to see if the impact on your head changed at all compared to wearing no headband. Turns out: it did! The headbands absorbed 70-80% more of the impact than without the headband! WOW! I created a poster based off of my conclusions, then wrote a final research paper on the topic. It was kinda fun to know my topic inside and out and to produce scientific documents explaining my work. 

This class always culminates in a presentation that looks like a big research convention, where all of us present our poster to the greater MIT community at the end of the semester. The event is held in Pappalardo Lab, where the sun shines brightly through the big open windows and sunlight hits our towering, gleaming posters set up in neat rows. Colorful graphs and arrows jump out at me, and each title snags my attention.

It’s so fun to go up to each student’s project and pepper them with questions – I take about 18 laps around the room in an effort to talk to everyone. Everyone is excited to talk about their work, and I am blown away by how deeply they know about their projects. Also, everyone’s projects are so creative and unique – like, how do you even come up with a project about the effect of alcohol on Mario Kart driving ability? 

Here are some other super cool ones:

Looking at all these cool projects, I get a pretty surreal feeling, and time and space warps so that I see all of my classmates’ faces, a few years younger. I see us all as freshmen, new to MIT. We are uncertain of many things – of how we will fit into this new place, of who we are and who we may become. I see all of our aspirations, and I see the great hope that MIT will provide us with the answers.

Those younger faces morph back into the older versions of themselves. The ones who have, over the course of a semester, become mini-experts in everything from 3D printing to bowling mechanics. If only our freshman selves could see us now. If only they could see the research we’ve crafted, the passions we’ve discovered, the skills we’ve gained, and the people we’ve become. 

I know that freshman year Emi would be so astonished by all that I have accomplished. I know that she would love to read my research and that she would look at the graphs on my poster with awe. And in that moment, as the culmination of all my classmates and I’s hard work hits me all at once, the feeling of pride plants itself firmly in my stomach. 

Heading into senior year is an interesting time of reflection. It’s easy to become lost in the fact that we only have one more year. A year of lasts, of mourning, of clawing at time wishing for it to slow down. 

Or…

Or it could be one more year to grow as we have grown the last three. Because if this is how far we have come in three years, just imagine what we can do in one more.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0003-800x1067.jpg

italy,Anika H. '26,0,2024-06-18T00:00:00-04:00,"Hi! this is going to be a sorta long blog so here’s a tldr:

I went to Italy to do some light research and travelling, stayed in a castle, analyzed samples of roman concrete, learned how to mosaic and fresco, visited the colosseum, pantheon, and several archeological sites, did research on metal and mortars at Pompeii, set Tetazoo loose upon society, annoyed the frosh and local wildlife, and generally had a good time.

 

 

Last semester, I took (3.094) Materials In the Human Experience. It was one of the most interesting classes I’ve ever had, getting to learn about concrete and iron through a practical portion that involved building an arch and a smelting furnace. When they told us there would be a two-week research trip to Italy, I naturally jumped at the chance.

The two desginated adults of the trip were Admir and Mike, who each taught the concrete and metals portions of the class.

 

castle

“so anyway, we’re staying in a castle—”

wild cheering ensues

After landing in Italy, we took a bus ride down to Sermoneta, where we stayed in Caetani Castle for a week. We hauled our luggage up the cobblestone steps, smoothed by centuries of people walking through. I packed light though, managing to shove everything I could into a single backpack. The castle itself was beautiful. It had a moat filled with plants, a drawbridge, a well, secret tunnels, and hole above the gate to pour hot oil down on your enemies.

When we got there, we spent a good while frolicking around the courtyard and running around on the castle walls. I tried to get into every nook and cranny I could as soon as I got there, but most of the doors that went to the interesting places were locked, and it took me two days of begging Admir for him to promise to open the doors over the weekend.



The tour of the castle was lead by the groundskeeper, Luca. He took us around the paintings and frescoes and showed us to the top of the little tower. While I would have liked to go to the top of the keep, the rickety stairs probably wouldn’t hold the weight of 13 people. We were shown around the stables as well and were told it held up to 50 horses at one point.

The small prisons held captured French soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars, and there were doodles all over the walls from them going on hunts and wanting to be freed. While we were there, I took this chance to briefly lock the frosh up in one of the prisons.

At night, I would often run up the stairs and spend a little while on the roof stargazing. Look up, and you’ll see stars and passing satellites. Look past the castle walls, and the town glimmers with light. Look in, and the frosh will be catching fireflies in the courtyard and standing on the edge of the well. The ground is warm and the air refreshing. I’ve caught myself falling asleep there.

 

exploring sermoneta

Sermoneta was a wonderful little town. One day during our free time, I took all the side roads I possibly can. It felt like a maze that was impossible to get lost in. No matter where I went, taking a flight of cobblestone stairs down lead to either of the main roads, and taking them up would eventually lead to the castle. The businesses and apartments were medieval style brick houses, often covered in lichen and flower vines.

For lunch and dinner, we would go down to a little restaurant called Antico Emporio. Despite the size of the kitchen, it made mouthwatering two-part meals. The pasta and meat were exquisite, and I don’t think I’ve had better potatoes in my life. The language barrier was initially a bit of a struggle, but we picked up some basic vocabulary from our professors and were able to communicate preferences and dietary restrictions. Whenever the owner asked how the food was, I’d give her a double thumbs up. We got breakfast at the place next door. Despite our usual timeliness (lack thereof), we were mostly on time for breakfast and our other daily activities, and soon learned that Tetazoo time, which is 15 minutes to an hour late, was just Italian time.

There were a looooot of cats here. We saw stray cats about as often as we see squirrels around Boston. Most of them were quite shy, but I met an orange cat and a calico cat that learned how to beg for food quite effectively. The mama cat has four black kittens that were all a little skittish, and we’d find them scattering into planters and drain pipes whenever we walked by.

kitty!

locations!

Terracina was the first of the archeological sites we went to. On the hike up, Admir asked us to point out everything Roman until we got far enough that there were entire sites full of Roman ruins. We were lead inside the base of an old temple, where restored mosaics were displayed and got toured around the ruins of the Capitolum. We took a few samples of mortar from the building (with permits of course) and wrapped them up to bring back. As Mike ran off to fuel his coffee addiction, the rest of us settled down for lunch, only to find half the lunch bags absolutely covered in oil from the rice. We spent the rest of the day at the beach. I was initially whining about the freezing cold water, but ended up spending the most time in the water collecting shells.

In the afternoon, we visited the Ninfa Botanical Garden, created by the last remaining members of the Caetani Family. The gardeners there have the unique job of preserving both the ruins of the town as well as the overgrowth of the garden. Its trees grow extremely fast in its unique microclimate, towering at just 150 years old. It stays cool during the summer and warm during the winter. The guide also seemed really excited showing us around. Every other spot was “the most beautiful corner of the garden”, and for good reason I think. There were fish in the river, clear springs in the bamboo forest, and wild climbing roses enveloping tall trees. The Caetani who planted the garden was also a painter, making it so the garden changes color every two weeks throughout the year. Back on the bus, we joked about leaving Mike behind since he was the last one on, and he said he would be happy to stay.

Back in the castle, we put the samples of the mortar in an instrument called an FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). By loading on a small sample of a material, it produces an infrared spectrum of its absorption or emission, which can then be used to identify it from an online database.

The next two days, we learned how to mosaic and fresco from restorers and artists. We learned how to cut marble, mix mortar, use quicklime, and operate a thermal camera. We made two different styles of mosaics and a fresco of Caetani Castle, adorned with waves and eagles, the two symbols of its family crest.

We couldn’t stay in Italy without visiting Rome, so we took two days to go sightseeing. We were skipping lines at both the Pantheon and the Colosseum and getting tours with real archeologists that have done excavation work there. It felt like everywhere we went, Admir “knew a guy”. Though I know it must have taken an incredible amount of work to plan the trip and make reservations, it still felt like magic every time we were let in through the staff entrance or led around a sea of people in line. I tried my best to stick near the front and ask questions. I remembered seeing pictures of these places in my middle school history textbooks, but seeing the breathtaking Roman architecture in person was an experience on another level. There was definitely theme of “medieval folk recycling Roman architecture”, which I found amusing. The Colosseum was covered in holes from where the metal supports were stolen, and the bronze overhead support beams in the Pantheon were melted to make cannons and replaced with wood. There were still a lot of the sites left to preserve and uncover. When we stopped for lunch at a local park, I would see bits of arches sticking out of the grass.

In the second half of these two days, the lot of us were set loose in Rome to wander. We got gelato at a place with 150 flavors, and indecision paralysis took me for 10 minutes trying to figure out how to select only two. In line, I discussed the volumetric difference between getting a cup or a cone, and couldn’t visually discern the better option. Mike got several more expressos, half of us went Pokemon chasing, and the other half (Tetazoo) ended up at the Tomb of the Unknown soldier. The full cohort visited the Trevi Fountain as well and made wishes upon a coin toss.

Over the weekend, we hit Priverno, an archeological site where Admir conducted much of his research on Roman concrete. Intermittently swatting each other with millet grass, we walked the broken mosaics through the ruins of a Domus, a traditional Roman house. While the content was really interesting, I couldn’t help but get distracted by the ridiculous number of snails covering the fenceposts and signs. We went up to the archeological museum for lunch and sat down at a small restaurant. There was one guy. He was the cook, the server, and the cleaner, and it was the best artisanal pasta I’ve ever had in my life.

pompeii research

Aside from Caetani Castle, I think my favorite experience was doing research in Pompeii. It was the largest archeological site I’ve been to by a massive margin since it used to be an entire city. We stayed at a hotel very close to site and took a back entrance into the lab every day.

I’m not allowed the share pictures of the lab, but they had mountains and mountains of bones and artifacts. Chiara, one of the researchers there, showed us around. On one shelf were the skulls and 3D facial reconstructions of a family found in the remains. They found animal bones from dinners past and fruit offerings at temples. There were turtle shells, carbonized remains of fabrics, and jars upon jars of pigments. All of us came out of there bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready for the next three days of research.

I thought walking the slippery cobblestone streets of Sermoneta were bad, but Pompeii was worse. With exception for a few sections of main road with wide sidewalks, we walked on horse-drawn cart roads. With the unevenness of the stones, I’m sure the horses must’ve had really strong ankles. We split up into groups based on research topics. In the first half of our first day there, I didn’t really do much, and out of boredom, I went to check on all the others. I spent most of my time with Admir and the mortar group. They were in Larario de Achille, examining piles of gypsum and the content of the different layers of a half finished fresco. In another room, Marco and the Egyptian Blue group were taking and processing pictures of frescoes with modified night vision goggles to observe the florescence of the unique pigment. A few feet further, Gianni and the photogrammetry group were watching a loading bar, waiting for their scans of the room to render. Right before lunch, I ran over to George and Pablo, who were using the FTIR on samples from the lab. They were originally supposed to look over a paper from the 1800s regarding a mortar mix with lime, charcoal, and urine, but nothing much came of that.

In the afternoon, I started my research in the metals group with Edwin and Mike. We used another instrument called an XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) gun to analyze a bunch of metal artifacts. It measures the emissions of a material that’s been excited with an x-ray beam and then determines its elemental composition. We did most of our work in a huge warehouse full of larger artifacts with shelves filled floor to ceiling. I made quick doodles of the objects as Edwin took pictures with Mike’s camera, which has an incredible microscopic zoom mode that lets it take detail shots. When the gun beeps after 90 seconds, Mike reads me the values he got and I jot them down in my notebook. Rinse and repeat for the next 40ish artifacts. We ran through lead pipes, ceramic fountains, and bronze vessels of all sorts.

We took a particular interest in the lead pipes. Since they were rolled up lead sheets, we XRFed the seams to see if the Pompeiians used a solder (they did). It was a lead-tin solder. The joints between pipes and valves had a different solder with an even lower melting temperature. When Mike went to get data in a slightly less structural area, I begged and bargained to go along, and got to see part of the hot water distribution system. On Friday, we presented our findings from the past three days.

Finally free from work, some of us decided to browse the Pompeii gift shops. I knew the Romans were like this but I was still unprepared for how many dicks I would see. There were rows and rows of bronze, wooden, and plastic dicks, dick can-openers, dick key-chains, and so on. Despite trying to walk along, the shopkeeper kept trying to show me more. I ended up going to the supermarket instead.

shenanigans

Since many of Tetazoo’s frosh joined 3.094 thanks to Anhad’s recommendation, a good portion of the trip was consisted of our shenanigans. Admir was constantly looking out for us like a concerned father, telling us not to stand on the edge of the well or get too far deep into the water. He nearly screamed when I tried to sit on the second floor railing at the hotel in Pompeii we stayed at, and seemed very worried about our steak knife sword fights at the dinner table. Like last year’s cohort, we started calling him Dadmir. Mike, in contrast, was relatively chill about us poking around. At the beginning of the trip, I got designated as town crier for addressing the two kings of the castle (Mike and Admir), imploring their majesties to graciously open the castle gate. In other words, I was being a pain in the ass and yelling from the courtyard to the third story window to get Mike. The lot of us would hang out together during free time and meal times. These were the times Roxxie collected a pile of cutlery at the dinner table, George curled up from getting teased, and Mike learned of me and Pablo’s pet leeches.

For dinner at Pompeii, there was this weird hallucination of a restaurant we went to. It wasn’t that bad, it was just everything was ever so slightly off. They served Pepsi in glass bottles with plastic caps, they had a DJ playing remixed US pop songs(the set wasn’t even working half the time), it was supposed to be middle-eastern themed but only served Italian food, and had an odd way of serving food. As one of the others described, it felt like an alien trying to run a restaurant like a human and not getting it quite right. Roxxie was always super excited to eat here and would not stop laughing once we sat down.

As much as I enjoyed terrorizing the frosh, I also thoroughly enjoyed poking at the new wildlife around me. Aside from petting the stray cats, I kept trying to catch lizards and pigeons. There were orange beetles and fireflies at Sermoneta, I found two rhinoceros beetles in Pompeii. On the way to lab, I scooped up a dead Giant Asian Hornet and put it in a plastic jar that Chiara gave me. I plan to either CT scan it or take pictures of it under a scanning electron microscope.

This trip was solidly the most fun I’ve had the entire year.

 

 

 

 

 

Thank you Mike, Admir, and everyone who made this experience possible.

the world is blooming!,Allison E. '27,3,2024-06-17T00:00:00-04:00,"You know those “four seasons” posters that elementary school teachers put up on classroom walls? They always summer, fall, winter, and spring with the colors of a tree: from green, to orange, to white, to pink, and back to green. Even past elementary school, in fact–my high school’s orchestra room door had a textbook version of these posters for their concert (Vivaldi’s “The Four Seasons”).

btw this is 35 sheets of 17”x11” paper painstakingly de-bordered (cut) and taped together–definitely a lesson in patience and attention to detail LOL

The last time I lived somewhere with four seasons (as opposed to constant summer) was in elementary school, so this is more or less the image of seasons that exists in my head. When it comes to summer, fall, and winter, I feel like these depictions do a pretty good job capturing what’s iconic about the season, whether that’s the sun shining on a sandy beach, or scarlet leaves caught in their moment of descent, or the sparkling blanket of freshly fallen snow. Even if motion is important to these moments–a breeze blowing, leaves falling, or snow drifting downwards–a single, static image is enough to capture at least the heart of those seasons’ joy.

But 
        spring
      
? Spring is something different.

I used to think the problem with these classroom posters was that trees filled with pink flowers aren’t even realistic, but I’ve learned the last few months that it’s not a lie. I thought it was just the cherry blossoms, because they’re all anyone talks about. And sure, there’s a good reason: cherry blossoms absolutely gorgeous. Trees with dark, delicate branches fully covered in soft pink petals–it’s flowers straight through, and they’re magical.

Cherry blossom tree near Building 66

The thing is, I thought it was just the cherry blossoms. I thought they were a hyperbolic archetype of pink-flowered trees–an exaggeration of a spring where some trees might grow a handful of flowers (speckled against a backdrop of green), and most do little more than sprout leaves and continue on their merry way. But it’s not just the cherry blossoms.

It started when I noticed the massive flowers emerging from a tree near Lobby 7, MIT’s main entrance to the central academic buildings. There weren’t a ton of them, and most of them were still tucked into their fuzzy little pods, but it only took them a couple of days to fully emerge.

    

About a week later, as I walked down dorm row to class, I noticed two trees with some buds emerging as well. They were pale green and fuzzy, large and… oh. They were definitely the same as the ones near Lobby 7. Except there were a lot more of them.



And then, day by day, the buds started opening up. I could see hints of pink. Then white. Then the petals started separating, and THEY BLOOMED!!!! I’ve never seen this many massive flowers bloom all at once and all in one place. It’s truly one of the most magical experiences I’ve had in nature–all these enormous petals gazing up at the sun with dark pink veins reaching up towards the white tips–and they were right along my daily walk from dorm to classes.

Over the next few weeks, I quickly learned that the magnolia trees are far from the only things blooming on campus in April and May. I guess spring really does live up to the image of flower-covered trees (at least in Boston)! I have more than 
        a hundred photos
      
 in my camera roll of flowers all across campus, so I’ll put a handful below if you’re curious:

But as beautiful and photogenic as all the flowers are, they’re not what I loved most about springtime. Certainly not the way that fresh snow is the most powerful moment of winter for me (I LOVE SNOW), or the way that a picture of auburn leaves falling captures the spirit of fall. For me, the defining experience of spring was not the flowers, but watching them grow.

I love walking down dorm row each morning to see the bushes just the slightest bit denser with green, or the daffodil petals spread out just a bit more beneath the sun. Every once in a while, I’ll notice a new color for the first time–the vibrant red of a not-quite-tulip(?) emerging from the ground, or tiny specks of green dotting a tree that was once bare. Then there’s the transitions past spring and towards summer–when the 
        neon green
      
 of freshly-budded leaves darkens to a deeper shade, or the flowers fall 
        petal by petal
      
 in what practically looks like snowfall.

Nature is changing at all times of the year, of course, but it’s so much easier to notice the little bursts of green appearing on the blank canvas of winter than it is to notice the patches fading to yellow against an already vibrant summer. There’s also just… the joy of watching things grow. Seeing the leaves emerge over the course of many days makes me feel like I’m a part of it all. I like to imagine that I’m the one turning the clock hands round and round, coaxing the flower buds open and unfurling leaves and slowly darkening the colors of springtime. It’s a 
        grandiose little delusion
      
, but a fun one nonetheless!

Because of all this, the defining experience of my first springtime in Boston really has been watching all these slow and incremental changes around me.

Aaand maybe inside me as well, because now that I’m looking back on my first year at MIT, I’m realizing how many similarly slow ways I myself have grown.

In the day-to-day chaos of the semester, I always looked to “Things I Did 💪🏼” as my touchpoints of pride and growth–cooking a massive meal with friends, helping run an ESP program or Science Olympiad tournament, or traveling alone. But I didn’t really notice or appreciate the more gradual changes. With scores of new people met and new friends made, I’ve learned how to make conversation more easily. In meeting after meeting with my 
        UROP
      
 supervisor or lab, I’ve learned to speak with confidence about my work. From new club position to new club position, I’ve learned how to navigate new responsibilities (without the crutch of an experienced person directly beside me). I’ve learned how to take notes in lectures, I’ve learned how to shop for groceries (kinda), how to live with roommates, how to work with less sleep, and so much more.

There’s nothing photogenic about 
        the process of learning how to shop for groceries
      
, even if the end product is rather nice. But it’s that slow progression–that transition from the tiny bud of a skill to a fully bloomed ability–that’s the experience that’s been the most fulfilling. And in this case, it’s not a delusion to imagine that I’m the one turning the clock hands round to make it all happen :D

P.S. As hard as I tried to capture the joy of watching everything grow with my deluge of photos, there was only one way I could do it a little bit of justice. So… here’s 
        forty-five
      
 pictures of the same tree along dorm row from March through May.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20210715_110504_Original-Copy-400x300.jpg

AARRRGHHHHH!!!!🏴‍☠️ (Pirate Post),Kayode D. '27,2,2024-06-02T00:00:00-04:00,"I mentioned it in a previous blog, but this semester I took a class called 21M.299: World Music Studies – Pirate Songs and Whaling Chanteys. I wanted to take a music class and this seemed like the most bizarre and wikipedia-rabbit-hole-inducing one being offered, so of course I took it. It’s taught by Professor Joe Maurer, one of the most knowledgeable people in the world on sea music, and it was an insanely fun class! 

At MIT, all students need to take 8 Humanities Classes total, of which, 2 have to be communications focused, 2 have to be humanities, 2 have to be arts, and 2 have to be in the social sciences (or something like that). This class counted for an arts credit. Additionally, students concentrate on a specific thing with their humanities courses, like Dance or Graphic Design or something like that. I think I’m going to concentrate in Music Technology if I can swing it with my schedule. 

The class had 3 main focuses: Historical Shanties, Shanty Revivals, and Modern Shanty Culture. I can’t spoil everything, since I want you all to take the class someday, but I will gloss over each section and share the coolest li’l thing in each. 

 

Historical Chanteys

I hate to be the one to burst your bubble, I really do. But PIRATE Shanties? Not real. You’ve been lied to by the 
         Big Mouse
      
.. The Golden Age of Piracy was from the 1650s to the 1730s, while the earliest documentation of the shanty phenomenon is from ~1867, putting the two in completely different eras. A “Historical Chantey” was a work song used to coordinate a heaving task 
        (like spinning the capstan to raise an anchor)
      
 or hauling task 
        (like raising the sails)
      
.

Usually, shanties were led by someone known as the “Chanteyman” whose entire job was to memorize and lead chanteys onboard a ship to make tasks faster. Unlike in modern media, instruments were rarely ever used on ships, so all songs were acapella. Most of these songs were slow, and the songs that might come to mind when you think of sea shanties (The Wellerman, Hoist the Colors, etc.) lack the structure of a true “Historical Chantey”.

That’s another thing! For the sailors, this wasn’t “sea music,” it was just “music” – there was no other music in their lives to distinguish from. Also, the word “Chantey” or “Shanty” was often spoken and not written 
        why would they write?
      
 , and chantey/shanty enthusiasts didn’t really nail down how it should be spelt, so it differs from place to place. All you really need to know is that “Chanteys” often refers to strictly historical chanteys, while “Shanties” loosely refers to any new age sea music. They are both pronounced the same way, though.

Favorite Historical Chanteys: Blood Red Roses, Blow the Man Down, 
        A Drop of Nelson’s Blood
      
 , 
        Pleasant and Delightful
      
. 

 

The Revivals

There was a big wave of shanty revival in the mid-to-late 1900s, largely spurred on by the folk music revival. A lot of great groups and singers like Lou Killen, A.L. Lloyd, Stan Rogers, and a lot of other great people and groups recorded and shared what was known about Historical Shanties, while also writing new songs in a similar style or theme, which we now call “Focsle Songs” (“Folks-ill”). There were a lot of bangers made, like 
        Barrett’s Privateers
      
 , 
        The Mary Ellen Carter
      
 , and 
        The Wellerman
      
 . This is where the definition of what a chantey is started to flake out, since most written songs were no longer for use on a ship. The word “Shanty” began to refer to any song about the ocean, which is sort of how people know it today. 

 

THE Sea Shanty Book



Stan Hugill’s book, Shanties From the Seven Seas is like the holy grail of sea shanties. He wrote it when he saw that the last of those who saw the shanties first hand were passing away, and he documented all that he knew about shanties. He goes into history and variations in lyrics for the different songs, and this book is where anyone would send you to learn about Historical Sea Shanties. I read all 400 pages of this book in 2 hours in the McCormick hall lobby because I procrastinated it, and it was honestly a pretty solid read, and if you are down about Disney pirates not being real, this book will make you excited about the real deals. 

 

Modern Sea Shanties

Believe it or not, a lot of Shanty and pirate culture was created in the last 20-30 years. If you look at a graph of people looking up “sea shanty” on google, the overwhelming majority come from 2020 on. This is due in large part to the blow up of the Wellerman on tiktok, the release of the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies, and the Assassin Creed games. Captain Joe had a special focus on this era of shanties, and we had insane insight into this part of History. I personally think he should make a 3 hour youtube documentary about the butterfly effect of things like the Curse of Monkey Island computer game and Mr. Smee’s horizontally striped shirt, and the impact that it’s had on shanty culture as a whole. 

There were also a ton of AMAZING bands and groups that popped up in recent years that have helped shanties become as popular as they are. Some are folky (and funky) like Schooner Fare, some make modern revamps of the classics like The Longest Johns, and some branch out into new modern genres like The Dreadnoughts with Metal Shanties.

 

Other cool Pirate-y things we did

In a typical class, we would read a passage or book before coming to class, discuss said passage for the first 30 minutes, talk about new material for the next 30 minutes, and end with 20 minutes of shanty singing. We practiced improvisation and getting our singing tone to match a sailors, and learned a ton about sailors. We also did shanty sings throughout the year, where we set up in Lobby 7 and sang for the people that walked past. It seemed nerve-wracking at first but it quickly became fun and I even led a song last time we did it.

We also made some incredible projects which I want to put in a blog of their own, because it’s so cool the things my classmates made. Go read it: [will update when available] (I would have put it here but i waited until night on 6/1 to ask for permission).

 

Final Words, before I Cross the Bar.

This class was so much fun. I think I looked forward to this class more than any other one that I’ve had at MIT yet. Professor Joe Maurer is one of the most knowledgeable people on shanty culture in the world, and I was beyond privileged to learn from him. I can safely say that my favorite thing about New England is the rich Sea Shanty culture and history here, and I’ll probably keep singing in the shanty sings in future years.

So if you want to learn more about the shanty revival concept album with Sting, a modern shanty album entirely about driving to buy almond milk for your sweetheart, or why pirates are depicted to be wearing striped shirts and have parrots on their shoulders, take this class whenever it’s offered next!! (I’m not entirely sure when that will be, but this is a very fun class.)

done with the b.s.,Waly N. '24,2,2024-05-31T00:00:00-04:00,"For my last blog as an undergraduate, there would be nothing more suitable than submitting it at 11:59 pm as I do with my assignments. So here is MIT by the numbers (MIT wrapped, if you will)…

 

5 MISTI experiences

I’ve traveled 3 times over IAP, and 2 times over the summer (counting the upcoming one)! 4 times as an instructor/workshop leader, and 1 time as an intern! I will have done GTL-Korea twice, GTL-Armenia once, MIT-MEET, and MISTI-UK. All of these were through MISTI, so they were cost-neutral meaning I got a stipend (to eat and live), flights covered, and housing. While doing MISTI, I’ve taken two personal side trips: 1 to Tbilisi, Georgia, and 1 to Tokyo, Japan. This upcoming summer, I’m doing a robotics research internship in the UK :)

 

433 units taken

Over my time, here I’ve taken 45-60 units each semester. I included my 17 GIRs and my 238 units past the GIRs, 180 of which I needed to graduate o__o. I didn’t ASE out of any GIRs, so I took each and every one 

 

13.25 Hasses 

I love humanities classes! When I was deciding on colleges, I knew that I wanted to do lots of humanities classes even if I went to a rather STEM-heavy school like MIT. I think I took enough classes number-wise to double major if I had taken them in the same area, but I was rather broad. The reason this isn’t a whole number is because I’ve taken a 9-unit Drawing class and been in a 6-unit music ensemble (Rambax MIT). Full classes usually are 12 units here.

 

2 Classes dropped on the week of Drop Date

I dropped 2.001/Mechanics and Materials and 6.008 on the week of drop date. 2.001 was honestly the roughest class I took here personally and wasn’t helped by dealing with trying to adjust to in-person MIT, classes for my major, a new dorm, mental health, and more. Sophomore fall was a shitshow, and I hope to forget that time. I dropped 6.008 cause I have never disliked a class so much before and it was a little birthday present to myself >:)

 

2 occasions of THE SAME laptop breaking

My laptop has had a rougher time through MIT than me. It broke during my first year, got repaired, and then broke again on me this spring with 2 days left in the semester. This time, it just randomly shuts down and won’t turn back on. I guess it really wanted to graduate early…

 

4 semesters of TA/LA-ing

I’ve done a bit of teaching at MIT as well! I’ve been a TA for Single-Variable and Multi-Varible Calculus in ESG (my first-year learning community) and I’ve been an LA (lab assistant) for 6.100A/B (Introductory Python) for 2 semesters.

 

3 Dorms

I’ve spent my time here almost equally divided between living in East Campus and Macgregor. I had a small stint in Simmons, which I did not like (personal take, it’s a fine place I swear), leading me to move out to EC. Outside of that Simmons stint (which was about 2 weeks), I’ve never lived in a dorm with an elevator. I usually don’t mind, but moving out is really rough.

 

8 semesters of being on CC

I’ve been my class year’s Social Chair since Freshman Fall. It’s been 8 semesters now, and I really love the other people in Class Council (I should express it more oops ;-;). I was very much considering leaving Class Council at the end of Junior Year, but the people are what made me stay. 

 

1 broken and fixed suitcase

Over this past Spring Break, my friends and I went to Spain! And immediately upon landing in Spain, I realized Iberia had broken my suitcase wheels, which to be fair had been well-traveled already. We had to awkwardly drag that suitcase around for the next week since it had all our stuff. Just two days ago, I fixed that wheel through! I had to hacksaw off the old rivet to replace the wheel though…

 

12 Teaholic visits Teaholic is a new boba store that opened not too far from MIT campus. It’s definitely my favorite in the area, so much so that I have earned a free drink there. I haven’t had a drink that I dislike there (though I find all of them sweet so I order 30% sugar) and I really enjoy seeing the guy (I’m so sorry, I should ask your name…) at the cashier who remembers me every time :)) 

 

21 blogs

Over the course of MIT, I’ve written 21 blogs, counting this one. Something about not having a fixed deadline always made blogging a bit hard for me, and I wish I had written more during my time here. But I think I’m happy with the pieces I’ve actually put out till now, and though I deeply cringe every time someone mentions they have read them, I guess I do feel a bit happy as well. 

 

1 scare of losing my brass rat

After a week of living blissfully, I realized I had not seen my Brass Rat in a while. After tearing my place apart, I could not find it, and I had days to order a new one in order for it to arrive before commencement. A few days later, the night after I called to order a new ring but no one picked up the phone, I found my brass rat in the dryer. It was in my laundry basket.

 

3 times of watching 2.009 live

I love watching 2.009 final presentations live! I’ve managed to luck out with the lottery 3 times, and have found each one to be really enjoyable and make me have an existential crisis about what I want to do with my life.

 

8 DT dances and 2 interludes

After being practically forced/heavily encouraged by my GTL teammate to dance with them in our recap video, my junior fall I joined DT. I found dance fun but didn’t know of many spaces for beginners until someone told me DT was open to everyone (not in a “everyone who is good enough” way but actually everyone). I just saw an audition before and was like “yep, no way I would get in.” Since then, I’ve been in 8 full dances ranging from Beginner in my 1st semester to Intermediate/Advanced in my 4th and 2 interludes, which are shorter dances with limited practice time. 

 

1 choreographed dance

In my final DT semester, I co-choreographed a dance for the semester’s show! The songs we used were Save Me by Nicki Minaj, Silence by Khalid/Marshmellow, Am I Dreaming by Metro Boomin/Roisee/A$AP Rocky, and Starwalkin’ by Lil Nas X. Choreographing was unfamiliar territory for me (luckily not for my co-choreographer, who was very well seasoned in the art), but I really enjoyed the process and our dancers were great ;-;. They gave me an Anya “heh” shirt at the end of the semester as a gift. I think I would have said even more sappy stuff to our dance at our final show than I already did but I already was kind of close to crying…

 

3 TKD tournaments

I’m not active in MIT’s Club Sport Taekwondo anymore, but when I was I went to three tournaments (2 at MIT,  1 at the University of Vermont). Quick disclaimer, this is not cause I was good. Pretty much anyone could go to a tournament to see what it was like. I realized I did not enjoy tournaments very much and they just stressed me out (other than enjoying watching other people kick ass), but these were still cool experiences I recall :)

 

3 major class events planned

Being on Class Council meant we plan class-wide events for 2024s, usually one per year. We held Twenty Fourmal in our 2nd year, Oceantation in our 3rd year, and Disorientation in our 4th year. Twenty Fourmal was a substitute for Freshman Formal, which we could not hold. Oceantation was an event at the New England Aquarium, where prefrosh usually visit during Orientation (we did not). Disorientation tends to be at the same venue, but we held ours at the Museum of Science instead. Outside of events, we plan class merch (hoodies, pants, jackets, stickers, graduation stoles) and smaller things like study breaks or food trucks.

 

2 summers with DynaMIT

For two of my summers at MIT, I spent the last week being a mentor for DynaMIT which is a program that does STEM outreach for students at local schools. I really like working with outreach programs and enjoyed doing DynaMIT both virtually (1st time) and in person (2nd time). I would have done it a third time, but I couldn’t because of my internship dates.

 

3 hosted CPW prefrosh and 2 hosted WISE students

I’ve hosted my fair share of prospective students in my room (usually on an air mattress). I think it’s fun to be a resource to a student curious about MIT with questions because I was definitely once that student (huh, I guess that’s part of why I write on the internet). 

 

8 mugs acquired

People keep giving me mugs at this place, which I really love as a gift but really hate to move when I’m packing. So far I’ve collected 8 mugs (one of them doesn’t have a handle but isn’t really a glass either, so idk), all of which have been free. I am currently struggling to pack these mugs.

 

4 PE Classes taken

So to graduate at MIT, you need to take 4 Physical Education classes. For myself, I took Air Pistol, Archery, Intermediate Soccer, and Swimming. All of them were fun minus swimming because I hated the pool (the instructors were great), and I’m pretty happy I had to take some PE classes overall. 

 

15 keychains collected from trips

A cheap souvenir I like is keychains since basically all cities have them in some gift shop and they are cool to hang on my backpack. From my own trips (and one or two from a friend), I gathered 15 keychains from 15 cities in 3 continents.

 

15 transportation cards collected

I am a public transportation fanatic. In fact, my graduation cap is themed around the MTA (which I have my gripes with, but I do like their train logo designs). So every time I visit a city with a semblance of public transit, I collect a ticket or card. So far I’ve gotten X, and hope to get many more. Funny enough, the cities I have keychains from and the cities I have cards from do not fully overlap.

 

2 dormspammed sales

I tend to start packing at the end of the spring semester and then hate myself for having so much random stuff I don’t need. So I have resorted to giving things away sometimes and also selling stuff on Dormspam with friends, which is basically emailing most of the campus a slideshow and begging them to buy my stuff.

 

594 Manga/Manhwa chapters read

I haven’t read a book outside of classes in a while, but I do enjoy fancy picture books a lot. Most of the ones I have read are completed works, but I follow one monthly. During my time here, I read Bastard, Tokyo Ghoul, parts of Tokyo Ghoul: re, Jibaku Shounen Hanako-Kun (I refuse to say the English name cause it sounds too cursed), Blood on the Tracks, and I currently am reading Oyasumi Punpun. If you know any of these works, you can see that I have a tendency to like darker stories…

 

66,999 emails received (give or take)

I forward all my MIT emails to my Gmail which means I basically never read my emails on Outlook where they first arrive. So I took a check at my Outlook and yep, that’s how many emails I’ve gotten while I was here. The number seemed a bit too perfect, so I sent myself a test email to see if it would go up, and it indeed hit 67,000 after I did that. The actual number is actually a bit higher cause I have occasionally read an email through Outlook before, but it should be fairly accurate. 

 

41 K-drama episodes watched

I never watched a K-drama before MIT, and it wasn’t until my senior year I watched very much. I watched 1 episode of Squid Game back in my 2nd year. During my 4th year, I watched Moving (over the course of a single weekend, oops) and Mouse, which I both enjoyed. I think I liked Moving slightly more, but Mouse gave me more food for thought. 

 

1 humanities minor

This semester, I realized I was weirdly close to a minor, so I submitted my application (late)! I’ll be graduating with a minor in Comparative Media Studies, which is a department I’ve really enjoyed taking classes in here :). For my minor I took 1 introductory and  1 advanced media studies course, along with classes in educational game development, the use of assessments in education, photography, and computer science education’s past, present, and future.

 

1 engineering degree

And last but not least, I’ve earned my degree! I didn’t know if I would graduate until the final grades came in and have been a nervous wreck for a hot second. After the long nights and not-acted-on plans to drop out of this place, I am done with MIT’s B.S. (most specially in EECS)! It has been a pretty bumpy ride ngl, but the ride has come to a stop To anyone who read my blogs during my time here and watched (or I guess read) me grow during my time here, thanks :). I hope to catch up with some life updates sometime, someday in the future. For now, it’s off to life post-MIT 🥲 and whatever that entails.

checked off,Waly N. '24,1,2024-05-31T00:00:00-04:00,"This blog has been in the works for a… long time. I first started this one on April 2nd. Of last year. I was looking through my blog drafts and realized I have a lot of half-finished blogs, which is a bit tragic. But alas, this one got finished.

During Orientation, every first-year gets a list of 101 things that they should do before they graduate. Since I am graduating (at the time of this being posted, graduated), I thought it would be interesting to look back at how many of these items I actually completed during my time here. So, here goes number 1…

- Learn all the course and building numbers ✅ This one I was able to accomplish pretty fast. The course numbers part came easy, but the building numbers were a bit harder. The main campus buildings are easy to remember because I go to them every day, but some of the further away buildings and grad dorms are pretty easy for me to forget.

- Participate in a UROP… or two ✅ I’ve done two UROPs so far at MIT. Both of these were during my freshman year, the first one jointly being in Course 15 (Management) and 22 (Nuclear Science and Engineering). The second one was with the Media Lab. So I guess I satisfied the “or two” part of this prompt.

- Ace a test ✅ I got around a 96% on an exam at some point in my freshman year, and that was when I peaked during my MIT career. A grade that high on an exam was never seen again.

- Play on an intramural sports team ✅ I’ve been playing on an intramural basketball team for about 3 semesters now! We play in the C League (Leagues go from A to C, in decreasing difficulty), so for a person like me with a terrible jump shot, it’s a nice but competitive level to play at. Though you always have that one ridiculously good team that has no reason to be in the C league. Last semester, I picked up intramural soccer, which is nice since I used to play soccer pretty regularly as a kid but fell out of it a bit due to some circumstances.

- Pass the swim test ✅ I… can’t swim. I swear when I try to, I just sink. People say, just breathe and you will float. BUT I DON’T. It’s not even that I’m nervous, I just… don’t float. I passed the class… so I checked it off but I feel that is cheating

- Show off your Boston sports pride ✅ I went to a Boston Celtics game and got a poster saying Authentic fan… so I must be one now by law. At least the C’s won’t disappoint me like the Knicks (and Nets depending on the year)

- Go to Tosci’s for ice cream ✅ I have been suffering from withdrawal because of how good Tosci’s Earl Grey ice cream is. I’ve only gone to Tosci, a local ice cream shop, about twice and each time, I share a two-scoop cup with a friend so that we can save money :D

- Use your MIT ID to go to the MFA for free ✅ During the summer of my sophomore year, I went to the MFA with a friend just to check it out. I’ve also gone as part of a class trip for 21M.601, Drawing for Designers. I don’t quite remember what we saw, but it was a nice change of pace to be outside of the classroom

- Jump in and take a selfie with a tourist ✅ Inviting myself into randos selfies is always a fun thing to do…

- Take free sailing lessons at the pavilion ⛔ This is something I really wish I did. I never took the sailing class at MIT because I took the swim class rather late (during Senior Fall). To take the sailing class, I would have had to then pass the boat test, which requires threading water for a few minutes, and I have/had no confidence in my ability to do that.

- Watch the sun set and rise from the Harvard Bridge ✅ I’ve only seen the sun rise once from the Harvard Bridge here (I have, however, seen it rise multiple times from my desk or a classroom on campus o__o). During Senior Fall, Class Council held an event called Senior Sunrise, which basically is seniors coming out and sharing munchkins as the sun rises. I’ve seen the sunset from the Harvard Bridge so many times, so that one was easier to get

- Go window shopping on Newbury Street ✅ Everything sold on Newbury Street outside of food/boba is violently outside of my price range, but I still look…

- Go to an outdoor concert ✅ Didn’t think I would check this one off, but I did within the last month. This month, we had Springfest, which is basically a student organization bringing an artist with some level of name-recognition to perform a concert on campus. This year, the artist was Cordae, and I went to Springfest for the first time. Cordae dapped me up at the end, so I can now officially say I’ve met a celebrity 😊

- Take a stroll through Little Italy in the North End ✅ I really like the North End part of Boston, and I’ve walked around it several times. I’ve walked around most of Boston casually, especially during my first 2 years here.

- Take a ride on a swan boat in Boston Commons ⛔ Again, I can’t swim… why would I pay to ride a boat on a lake ;-;

- Take a road trip to an away game for MIT sports ✅ Kind of cheating on this one, but I am counting club sport tournaments toward this. When I was doing Taekwondo, I once went to a tournament at the University of Vermont, which is also my one and only visit to the state.

- Get to know your professors outside of class ✅ I’ve talked with them I swear

- Find your new favorite food truck ⛔ I feel every food truck that comes to MIT tends to be pretty expensive, so I haven’t liked any of them so far.

- Enjoy a free steak and lobster dinner during rush ✅ Cheating again a bit… I didn’t have steak/lobster but it was still a fancy dinner so I think it fits the vibes of this question.

- Attend a MITSO concert in Kresge ⛔ Some people here are incredibly musically talented, so I wish I saw a MITSO concert while I was here. MITSO I believe is our symphony orchestra. I don’t have much more to say here… I don’t know much about music oops.

- Take a class during IAP ✅ My first IAP here I took Japanese 1! It unfortunately was virtual as things were in January 2021, but I still enjoyed the class a lot. My Japanese is atrocious but it’s still cool to be able to say some basic stuff. I took Japanese 2 the following semester, and after a long hiatus, attempted to take Japanese 3 Senior Fall, but dropped it after a few weeks.

- Check out the parks on Rose Kennedy Greenway ✅ Haven’t visited all of the parks on the greenway, but I went to the rose garden! It was really pretty, and when I went, the roses were in full bloom. Unfortunately, I got kicked out like 15 minutes after I entered because they were closing early that day for some unknown reason.

- Get dressed up for a formal ✅ I’ve gotten dressed up for three formals during my time at MIT! The first was Twenty Fourmal, an event I planned with Class Council during our Sophomore Fall. Then there was Ring Delivery, where we got our Brass Rats during Sophomore Spring. Most recently, we had Senior Ball, our final class-wide event, at the Prudential Center’s Observatory, which had really nice views of Boston and Cambridge.

- Walk the Freedom Trail ✅ During my 1st year strolls, I walked most of the Freedom Trail! I don’t have particularly strong memories of it, but I did really enjoy seeing the obelisk near Bunker Hill.

- Go to the Skywalk Observatory in Prudential ✅ Spoiled this two items ago, but I went to the new version of the Skywalk Observatory called View Boston for Senior Ball!

- Check out the view from the ICA ⛔ Never been to the ICA…

- Zip around the ice rink at Spooky Skate ⛔ I’ve skated at MIT before, but never during Spooky Skate :(

- Behold Boston’s 4th of July fireworks ✅ During my first summer here, I went to watch the 4th of July fireworks with some friends. We watched from the Longfellow Bridge. I think it was raining a bit that day, but the fireworks were still pretty nice. Inferior to New York’s, but good for Boston.

- Host an incoming first-year during CPW ✅ I’ve hosted three students for CPW! I did my fair share of fly-ins when I was in high school and always appreciated my hosts who gave me a better idea of the school, so I really enjoy hosting prefrosh. I’ve also hosted for WISE twice, which is MIT’s fly-in program.

- Build a snow fort on Killian ⛔ Never found myself invested enough to create a snowfort on Killian Court, but I have had a snowball fight there before. To be fair, we have had like 3 tame winters in a row, and I have a habit of escaping the US over IAP, so this might have contributed to me never completing this one.

- Take a 48-hour social media cleanse ⛔ I am simply too addicted for this to actually happen. I think it would be very good for me though.

- Try something new in a PE class ✅ Air pistol! I had never shot anything more powerful than a nerf gun before this class, so it was cool to do something a step (or several steps) above that. I started off real bad in the class, but I improved a lot by the end, so I was pretty happy with my level by the end :)

- Be an Associate Advisor ✅ During my sophomore year, I was an AA. I feel I was a pretty bad AA though… I had a really rough sophomore year and definitely wasn’t as active as I would have liked to have been. The professor I was advising with was really amazing and was more of an advisor to me than my actual advisor, so I still appreciate her a lot ;-;

- Visit all the dorms ✅ This one took surprisingly long for me to finish. I visited most of the dorms by the start of sophomore fall (we had a thing called Covid that stopped me from visiting them earlier), but Baker was eluding me. It wasn’t until later in Sophomore year that I ate at Baker dining, completing this task

- Go to an event advertised in the infinite corridor ✅ I’ve gone to several events advertised in the Infinite… too many to really count

- Cross register at Harvard ⛔ To be honest, not having done this one is probably one of my biggest regrets at MIT. I basically kept saying to myself every semester that I will cross-register during the next one, just to not actually do it at all. I was planning to at least get my Harvard Library ID (which MIT students can get) this year, but Harvard Yard was closed to outside visitors for quite a share of May this year.

- Watch an LSC (Lecture Series Committee) movie ✅ I think I’ve only gone to one LSC movie night, but it was a pretty fun time! I watched Spirited Away on 35mm with some of my friends on a Friday or Saturday night. I haven’t watched many Studio Ghibli movies but I’ve seen some, with my first one being Ponyo back in like 2011.

- Take a selfie with TIM the beaver ⛔ TIM the beaver has been avoiding me my whole time at MIT, and it makes me very sad. I don’t know what I could have done to deserve this :(

- Enjoy a game of candlepin bowling ⛔ I don’t know what candlepin bowling is, but considering I dislike bowling unless I get a strike/a spare, not sure how much I would enjoy it.

- Drink only water for a week ⛔ Not healthy enough for this one.

- Sleep in Barker ⛔ I have slept in a few places on campus, but Barker is not one of them. I remember once taking a nap on a couch in the MIT.nano building, which was pretty comfy. I also procrastinated a project too long this semester and slept on an ESG beanbag instead of my bed in my dorm.

- Get a burger at Tasty Burger ⛔ People have recommended Tasty Burger to me a few times, but I never got around to trying it. I almost did one day, but then my friend and I got lazy and decided to do delivery from another place instead. Had I recalled, this was an item on the list, I might have dragged her to go with me.

- Attend the 2.007 competition ✅ I attended the competition… on Zoom. But lots of stuff during Spring 2021 was virtual, so I counted it towards the

- Run/volunteer/go to the Boston Marathon ✅ It took a while, but I went to watch the Boston Marathon during Senior spring. I had an assignment to do for my photography class related to taking pictures of people, so I felt like the marathon would be a good place to make a stop. I was doing analog photography, and I feel I got a few nice negatives out of the event, but I didn’t know how to focus well so some of them could have been better.

- Taking a picture with the Make Way for Ducklings Statue ✅ During our first spring at MIT, Class Council planned a scavenger hunt for people to be able to explore Boston/Cambridge. This was one of the quests people had to complete and I did it with my pod, which is a medival term referring to the group of 6 people (inclusive) you could interact with unmasked during pandemic-era MIT.

- Enjoy a summer at MIT ✅ I’ve spent about 1.5 summers here! I spent my first and part of my second summers working on campus. My first summer I was doing a UROP, and my second summer I was working with the Edgerton Center. It was nice to be at MIT without the looming pressure of classes, and just enjoy the area for real :)

- Have liquid nitrogen ice cream ✅ I’ve had lots of liquid nitrogen ice cream here, most recently at ESG’s senior dinner. One of our professors made 8 or so different ice cream flavors, which I really liked :))

- Explore Castle Island in South Boston ⛔ I did not realize Boston had an island until looking at this question… so I have not visited any so far.

- Go to an improv show ⛔ I feel I’ve seen some improv shows at MIT posting flyers, but they aren’t too frequent, so I’ve never actually attended one.

- Get your brass rat at ring delivery ✅ During ring delivery sophomore spring, I got my ring and Covid! I really liked Ring Delivery since our venue was pretty fancy, meaning that we could take pretty pictures. There was also a pretty good amount of food, an ice sculpture of a brass rat, and photobooths.

- Go to Boston Public Library ✅ It wasn’t until Senior spring that I went to the Boston Public Library Main Branch but when I did, I had wished I went sooner. It is a really pretty library and there are nice murals and study spaces with varying levels of quietness. I went back again during that same week just because of how much I enjoyed BPL.

- Walk to the Harvard Arboretum ✅ I walked to the Harvard Arboretum from MIT during what I believe was Junior Fall. It was right around the time foliage was pretty, so I was hoping to take some pretty photos on my camera. I didn’t get as many nice photos as I liked

- Go to the Lawn on D ⛔ Never been, though I considered going pretty often. They seem to host special events rather regularly, but I always found myself wanting to sleep in on Fridays/Saturdays

- Go to Mr. Bartley’s for a frappe ⛔ I searched up Mr. Bartley’s for the first time today to see if this is an actual place that exists and it does! I’ve never been there, but it seems like a nice place to go sometime. Maybe if I ever return I will go…

- Go to the great glass pumpkin patch ✅ I stumbled on this one day on my way home! The pumpkins at the glass pumpkin patch were all way too expensive for me to ever afford, but they were very pretty. There was a big acorn that was close to $1,000 dollars, which I was too scared to touch in case I accidentally shattered it.

- Nap on Killian Court⛔ I am not a fan of napping outdoors. I have napped on campus, but it tends to happen on couches or in a lecture hall, not on the grass of Killian (when it has grass, since it gets killed every year by Commencement).

- Visit the Kendall rooftop garden ✅ The rooftop garden was closed for my first two years due to renovations, but I made a visit once it finally re-opened up. It is a pretty nice space near campus and sometimes they have free food events too. I once got some finger food and cotton candy which I very much appreciated ^_^

- Get a Red Sox ticket from MITAC ✅ I got a free Red Sox ticket from the Office of the First Year, does that count o__o

- Grab a gumball from the OFY ✅ Talking about the Office of the First Year, they have free snacks and gumballs. I haven’t grabbed many gumballs from them, but I have grabbed my fair share of chips and the like from their stash.

- Watch tetris on the Green Building ⛔ I don’t think this has every happened during my time at MIT? It is possible that maybe I just missed it, but I don’t think that is the case.

- See penguins at the New England Aquarium ✅ We had our signature junior year event at the aquarium! There were a lot of penguins in their enclosures, though some of them were starting to go to bed since our event was pretty late.

- Go on a Duck Tour ⛔ During Orientation, I think a lot of freshman get to go on a Duckboat that tours them around Boston. Unfortunately, our year never got to do any of that stuff, so I probably will never know what a Duckboat is truly like.

- Ride all the T lines ✅ I said I did this one on a technicality; I’ve ridden some of the Silver Line buses, but not all of them. I think I’ve taken the SL1/2/3 but not the SL4/5. I took the red line pretty early on, along with the green (all of them) and orange lines. The blue line took a while to take, but I eventually found myself on that train on the way to the aquarium one day.

- Find your favorite place in Quincy Market ✅ I had a good lobster roll once at a seller in Quincy Market, so I guess that was my favorite place. But sadly, lobster rolls are too expensive for frequent consumption.

- Be an Orientation Leader ✅ I was a OL for the Class of 2025! Being an OL was a good experience, and I met some friends that I continued to talk to for the rest of MIT. Special shoutout to the 5ish people in my OL group (Black 83 I think) that consistently showed up– I appreciate y’all :)

- Ride an orange trolley ⛔ I have no clue what this one means to be honest

- Earn a pirate’s license ⛔ Really wanted to get a pirate’s license, but unfortunately, I can’t thread water well, so I didn’t take the boat test needed for the sailing PE class at MIT. I also failed at getting into fencing a few times. One time, I was 1st on the waitlist and the last registered person only showed up with 5 minutes left in the class, taking the spot >:(

- Take the T to Revere Beach ⛔ I don’t think I’ve been to a beach in Boston, but I imagine it is more of a rocky beach instead of a sandy beach? Correct me if I am wrong though.

- Check out the Tree Lighting ceremony in Boston Commons ⛔ I think the tree lighting ceremony in Boston is right around the busiest times of the fall semester, so I never saw the tree lighting. I do find tree lightings a bit underwhelming though, so I don’t think I missed too much here

- Go to Haymarket ✅ During the semester, I find that I am usually a bit too busy to go to Haymarket. I also don’t cook as often, so buying a lot of fresh fruits and veggies that I forget to use isn’t always the best of ideas. But during the summers I was here, I went to Haymarket quite a bit! I liked to go on Saturdays close to closing because there sometimes are really nice deals

- Eat at every dining hall ✅ I’ve eaten at all dining hall and my verdict is that they are all kind of average but with really high standard deviations. Somedays I get something that is amazing and cooked well, while other days I will get rice that has been cooked into a paste. To be fair, I pretty rarely go to dining halls, so my experiences are a bit limited.

- Study abroad ⛔ So I’ve done lots of teaching abroad, but I have never been a student. Part of me thinks study abroad would have been a cool thing to have done, but another part is happy I didn’t miss out on parts of MIT either

- Take a Boston harbor ferry ride ⛔ I’ve never taken any of the ferries, cause nowhere I go has ever required the use of one so far.

- Go to a block party at City Hall Plaza ⛔ I did not know City Hall had block parties? I think there is a chance this is a thing that ended when Covid started, but if it isn’t, I’m sad that I’ve been missing out.

- Send a postcard home ⛔ During my time here, I’ve gotten a lot of postcards, but I like to mainly use them as dorm decor. I hang them up on my walls or sometimes on my fridge. I’ve never actually sent a postcard to anyone, not sure if I ever will.

- Get a Flour Rasberry Seltzer ⛔ My friend this week actually mentioned that they liked the Rasberry Seltzer at Flour, so maybe it might be worth trying. I usually am rather seltzer-averse, so it might take some encouragement for me to do so.

- Get 25 free t-shirts ✅ I wrote a blog on this a while back, but I have lots of free t-shirts. So many that I have bought

- People watch in Lobby 10 ✅ I’ve staffed tables in Lobby 10 for ticket sales for some student organizations I’m in, so I’ve just wound up watching people walk by as a result.

- Go to the Pride Parade ✅ Does going to Pride in another city count? Boston hasn’t had a parade in a while, but I went to Seattle Pride last year when I was interning there over the summer

- Eat at ??? Pastry ⛔ This one got ripped off slightly on my paper, so I don’t know whether it says Modern Pastery or something else.

- Walk 364.4 smoots across the bridge ✅ I think this one is just saying to cross the Harvard Bridge, which I have done so many times here.

- Green Building Stairs Challenge ⛔ Absolutely not. Why do the Green Building stairs when I can just live all my 3.5 years on campus in dorms without elevators? For reference, the Green Building is a little under 20 floors.

- Get boba in Chinatown ✅ As a boba addict, I have tried boba from every corner of Boston, including Chinatown. I think I’ve gone to maybe three stores in the area and my experiences have ranged from very mid to actually pretty good bubble tea.

- Master the tunnels ✅ Boston can be way too hot during the summer, and for the most part, the tunnels have AC. You can walk from Lobby 7 to the Kendall T stop using only the tunnels, so I’ve managed to get pretty good at navigating them to avoid the elements.

- Visit the Mapparium ⛔ My friend and I were considering doing some grad photos here, but alas, it never happened :(

- Go to an Acapella concert ✅ I think I have seen most of the MIT acapella groups perform at least once! I love their shows so much, since they are at the end of the semester it is a really nice break from studying/project work. I usually go to the shows of groups that I know people in, but I sometimes also go to any show that seems interesting, has a cool semester theme, or has good vibes.

- Host a study break ✅ During my first summer at MIT, I was doing a UROP and also a summer RA. As a summer RA, I planned some study breaks for the people I was an RA for, including a smoothie study break. I guess it wasn’t a study break persay because it wasn’t during the semester, moreso a time to get to better know each other.

- Volunteer for a campus event ✅ I think being an Orientation Leader should count for this one…

- Pretend to be a prefrosh during CPW ✅ Since we didn’t have a CPW, my first in-person CPW as a student was spent masquerading as a prefrosh to experience the events, get some food, and have that whole experience.

- Met 10 MIT people from 10 countries ✅ Quick roll call → On the top of my head, I’ve met people from India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Palestine, Albania, Venezuela, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Mexico. And a few more. So I think I checked this one off.

- Tie dye a shirt ⛔ This is probably one of the easiest ones to get, but I just never got around to doing this. Oh well.

- Watch Head of the Charles ⛔ Head of the Charles starts a bit early I believe, which meant that chances are I was not going to be found in the crowd of spectators.

- Hack something ✅ I think my pen slipped and I mistakenly checked this off.

- Visit all of the Cambridge squares ✅ I’m not sure if I have all of the squares down (Inman, Central, Harvard, Kendall), but if I do, I think I have visited all of them before. I’ve only set foot in Inman Square once though, to pick up a coffee table I got for free on the reuse mailing list. The cleaning staff later threw out this coffee table unannounced, much to my annoyance.

- Find your favorite coffee shop ✅ Coffee is not my beverage of choice, so I don’t like coffee shops. I do, however, like boba shops, and Teaholic has been my favorite one since it opened. I have mixed feelings about Teado and Moge, which are also both in Cambridge not far/on campus.

- Do a PKG service trip ⛔ PKG is another thing I think would have been cool to have tried out at MIT, but there simply wasn’t the time to do it.

- Attend Career fair ✅ I have attended every career fair minus the virtual ones we had during my first year. I love getting tons of free and honestly pretty high quality merch from companies I never heard of before. I do not love, however, having a recruiter review my resume live in front of me with slight nods and headshakes of disapproval (personal experience).

- Visit the MIT museum ⛔ I might do this tomorrow… it is my last chance to check out the museum before I leave this place. Even though it won’t count towards the 101 things to do before I graduate, it would still be cool to see. Especially since Nimbus, the old Solar Car build by SEVT, has a home there.

- Find the hidden Kenmore Bodega ⛔ Since this bodega was hidden, I never found it. I also never really searched for it either, so I guess I would have only gotten this one if I magically stumbled upon the bodega.

-  Attend Senior Week ✅ I skydived! One of the senior week events this year was tandem skydiving up in Maine. Ngl, I was worried I might throw up when I jumped out of the plane with the instructor but I did not!! The initial freefalling felt like when you are in a dream and you are falling and can’t stop falling but it was for real. After about a minute, the instructor opened the parachute and flew me through a cloud, which is still kind of crazy to me

-  Earn your degree ✅ Somehow did this one…",,0
updates,Uzay G. '26,1,2024-05-30T00:00:00-04:00,"Hey!

Here are some personal/academic updates. I haven’t been blogging enough as you can tell, but I want to be prolific this summer.

This semester I spent a larger than usual amount of time thinking about more personal topics and reflections in my life, which maybe I’ll unpack in other posts, but here are the more easily explained things.

Classes

Inference and information – 6.7800

This is MIT’s grad inference and information class. It is challenging. Each lecture has a bunch of content and it’s overwhelmingly rich – but it’s well organized and I learned a lot from it.

I think you learn a few things in this class, but mainly:

- 
what is the formal and statistical setup people have found to describe the problem of learning & inferring things given data, when evaluated with respect to the optimal solutions (and what are those solutions)

how can we quantify the notion of “information” and estimating randomness

You also improve on some meta-skills and get more of things like:

- 
the mathematical knowhow to take a bunch of scary symbols and boil it down to intuitive understanding and solve problems/prove properties of your algorithms

Secure Hardware Design – 6.5950

Veally cool. I did hacking stuff in highschool, notably capture the flag competitions where you need to break into different artifical systems to win. I like the hacker mindset because breaking things, especially secure things, makes you focus on really understanding something through and through.

You need to explore every angle and get a deep understanding of the way the components interact. Now, in many fields you need to learn something deeply, but often especially in school you don’t have real feedback loops on your learning, or at least feedback loops that aren’t artificial like exams. This makes your understanding more brittle, whereas when you try to break something you explore every facet, and breaking it adequately becomes the feedback loop for your learning.

This mindset of turning things into a game extends to many different things. Even in math, you often read about how great mathematicians have the skill of playing with mathematical objects and examples, breaking them down, seeing where things fail and where they work, to develop a good perspective of the field. I think it’s pretty key, but in cybersecurity it’s baked in.

This class was structured to match these ideas – fully graded on labs, where you can freely explore the content from culture and hack the systems they build for you. Very fun stuff and very competent course staff. Would recommend. You basically do low-level hacking and learn more about systems/system design along the way.

Topology/Quantum – 18.901/8.04

This duo was a bit weird. I was taking 8.04 for the first half of the semester, which is Quantum I, because I want to learn quantum physics at some point, even if I’m not a physics major. But I felt like since I don’t need this class for anything, I should only take it if the assessments actually feel useful for what I care about, which is mostly developing a deeper conceptual physics understanding. It felt like although the lectures were interesting what I was being tested on was more about being able to compute and do the math than the physical ideas, so I decided to drop it. And I added topology on add date! which is about halfway through the semester.

The content in topology is quite beautiful. Topology is about shapes, and in particular what properties of shapes are preserved under a few different operations, like continuous deformations and stretches, or bends, retractions, etc…

This seemingly simple question is really complicated! Once you’ve formalized these notions, how do you prove different shapes are truly different? 

It’s hard in general to prove there is no way to map two things to each other unless you leverage something called invariants. Invariants are properties that don’t change under a given set of transformations. In this class you define the formalisms for what it means for different shapes to be “equivalent”, and then you define invariants that are preserved by topological equivalences, and learn to compute those invariants.

The content is quite pretty but I did not feel the way it was taught was very instructive for me, so I mostly ended up reading the book and doing problems, which was a bit sad.

Reading and Writing the Essay – 21W.735

Maybe this class is partly responsible for my less than productive blogging this semester. I very much enjoyed it. It’s a writing workshop where you can write about basically whatever you want in essay form, and you get a lot of detailed feedback from your peers and the prof.

I think the key part for me was reading a bunch of really good essays and getting precise, detailed feedback. This class has shown me how writing can really help me clarify my thoughts on something, and I’ve gotten better at conveying ideas in a pretty, argumentative way.

I think my writing interests sits in this zone between conveying aesthetic emotion/a sense of shared empathy and understanding and actually bringing out philosophical ideas and arguments.

What I wrote about:

- 
existentialism and committing to one’s values


existentialism and committing to one’s values

- 
cultural elites and the values they reflect, contrasting French intellectualism and the American tech scene

-

- 
political polarization and the rise of discourse focused on making institutions feel safe rather than advancing particular values in a normative way

I want to unpack some of these more and maybe bring them to the blogs, but not yet.

Research 

I started doing research in the Isola lab this semester, and that’s what I’m continuing in Boston this summer. I like my mentors a lot and think the problem I’m working on is quite interesting.

It’s pretty hard for me to context switch and do research properly during the semester, so I’m excited to focus for the next few months on this. 

I’m studying in-context learning, or the phenomenon where language models like ChatGPT, given sequences of the form x, f(x), x’, f(x’), … ie input-output examples of a function f in their prompt, can generalize and figure out the value of new inputs, ie predict f(x”) from x”.

In particular in-context learning is interesting because it underlies a lot of the reasoning ability of the best language models, and it’s still relatively poorly understood. It’s important because we want to know to what extent models learn complex inner search procedures/inner optimization goals, and we want to be careful about what those goals are. Developing a better theory for in context learning is also useful to describe model internals and make better optimization procedures.

This project is in the field of theory of deep learning, which I’m considering specializing in, so it’s very exciting and I particularly enjoy working at the intersection of empirical ML and more theoretical conceptual and mathy thinking.

Climbing

I wasn’t super focused with climbing this semester, but I still got a bit better. I learned to channel a bit more calm and stoicism in the way I climb to not get frustrated, really consider where I’m getting stuck, and then try again in a more focused way. This helped a lot, and now I’m climbing at a V5 level. This summer I will be more consistent and try to make progress on my footwork, my main bottleneck.

Doesn’t Feel Real,Paige B. '24,3,2024-05-24T00:00:00-04:00,"This semester, I took three classes. Two of them were math with my soon to be Ph.D advisor, and the third was with Marah Gubar– an amazing professor that I’ve had the pleasure of learning from for the past three semesters. This class was called the “Wilds of Literature,” and the main idea for the course is to pick a spot in nature relatively near to Boston, go visit it a number of times throughout the semester, and then write about your experiences/thoughts in nature. Throughout the course, we read a bunch of nature writing from Thoreau to Walt Whitman, as well as more modern writings (which I got a lot of inspiration for).

Ultimately, on all of these walks, I reflected a lot on my time at MIT and my relationship with academia and (mental/physical) health. There’s a lot I could say, but I think I will just put the piece here. I am really proud of the piece and hope you like it.

Doesn’t Feel Real

 

“How did having a disability affect your time at MIT?”

“It didn’t. Well, I mean. I couldn’t let it, so. It didn’t.”

…

Picture from 2021!

The flowers on cherry blossom trees, once bloomed, typically last about one to two weeks in springtime. At MIT, with these flowers comes the optimism of students. They signify a halfway point: between the cold winter days to the dreadfully hot summer nights. Between the “I can’t make it through this semester” to the “I can count the number of assignments I have left on my fingers.” The cherry blossom trees bear not only flowers, but freedom.

—

On the second floor of McCormick Hall in Room 239, where I stayed my freshman year, is a perfect unobstructed view of these trees. Having hardly left my room in the middle of a pandemic, I had a front row seat to see a late April thunderstorm wipe out the just-budding flowers before they even got to bloom. I watched the petals helplessly fall away. I wondered if they looked back at me with the same pity. And it was then, for the first time in the roughly two months I had been living on campus, that I decided to go for a walk with my friend Ana.

I was expecting a 20 minute stroll around MIT: 10 minutes going through the Infinite, 10 minutes walking back along the Charles river, and then parting ways so I could go back to my homework. Instead, when I met with Ana, she excitedly suggested we go for a walk along the Esplanade. I didn’t want to tell her no, and so off we went. 

The first ten minutes of our walk I was nervous. I kept thinking about my laptop that I had left back in my room. My assignments, carefully organized using digital Post-it notes, screamed for my return. But I had also never done this walk before, and I hate not knowing where I am going.

My mom used to say that I’m directionless; not in life, but by foot. I could follow a path I’d taken a thousand times before, but not one slightly adjacent. But to be fair to my younger self, I come from a town of one-story buildings, deadends, and no discernable differences between this street (named Maple) and the next street over (also named a type of tree). In Fresno, California, most of the time you can’t even see the place you’re trying to walk to. So as a kid without a GPS in her pocket, I knew that deviating from a path I knew well could result in becoming woefully lost. And not only that, but the one time I attempted ‘a shortcut’ and got lost resulted in what will forever be known in my family as the “AutoZone incident”. So I stuck to the paths I knew, and I became labeled as directionless.

By the time Ana and I made our way off of the Harvard bridge and onto the footpath, my nerves eased up. The thoughts shouting “my laptop is in my room” became relaxing.

My laptop is in my room.

It’s there, and I’m here.

Be here.

It also becomes abundantly clear that the path we are taking is simple—you can practically see all the landmarks you’ll be hitting: Hatch Memorial Shell, Longfellow Bridge, and, of course, MIT. I can see where I am going, and I’m with nice company too. Outside of Room 239, the world feels so much bigger. The sky is so clear that you can see the tops of the skyscrapers.

…



It’s my senior spring, and I find myself walking around the Esplanade again. It’s been three years since the first time, and two years since Ana graduated. But today, most of the buildings are hidden through an uncomfortable fog. I wonder what it must feel like to work in those towers on days like today; is there a woman 100 floors up who can only see clouds when she looks out below? Does she feel like she’s on top of the world? Or secluded from it? I know things are happening up there, but I can’t see them, and because of that they don’t feel real.

It doesn’t feel like it’s been three years. As I walk along the Esplanade today, it’s as if a ghost of a younger version of myself walks besides me. A ghost materialized in the form of pure buzzing electrostatic stress from my freshman year brain. Stress over whether or not I was doing enough to get into graduate school, and whether or not I was making lifelong friends at MIT.

I look at this ghost beside me and feel a deep sense of pity. I wish I could go back and tell my freshman year self that things are going to work out. Beg her to slow down. But, in truth, I can’t help but feel like I’d do it all again. Who knows where I would be now had anything been different. Where I would be now had I worked less hard. It feels as though if I had done anything different, my career could’ve been nipped in the bud.

Today, I look ahead to graduate school and wonder if I will ever be able to slow down. The buzzing stress returns to my brain. My head feels… full. It’s like my brain is running at 1000 miles an hour while simultaneously being unable to process any of the internal or external information. I know things are happening up there, but I can’t see it, so it doesn’t feel real. Today, I empathize a bit too hard with the fogged-in woman on the 100th floor.

Something needed to be different. Something needs to be different. So why am I finding it so hard to change?

…

Once I find a familiar path, I like to keep on it, by foot and in life. In life, the path that I found was working hard on academics. I could put in the work, get the grades, and keep getting further and further along the path. And I’ve always loved school. But if you were to go dig up copies of my middle school report cards, you’d think I was lying, because in the span of the fall semester of eighth grade, I had missed more than a third of my classes.

The days after I had missed school, my teachers would always ask where I had been but I’d never really answer them. I’d say, “I’m sorry I missed class. Here’s my homework. It won’t happen again.” I didn’t want to tell them that the reason I was missing their classes was because I was in so much pain.

I had tried to tell them. Every day after lunch, my Algebra 1 teacher would ask how I was doing when I entered the classroom and I’d answer: “tired, but okay.” She didn’t think much of it. It simply became our routine. What I wanted to tell her is that I could start to feel a migraine forming in my left temple. That the slight aches in my neck, there from the beginning of the day, are no longer feeling so slight. That as much as I love school, I’m starting to feel like I can’t do this anymore. 

I don’t tell her all of these things. I tell myself that there are a number of reasons not to tell her: that it doesn’t matter, that class starts in five minutes, that she doesn’t really care how I’m doing. But really, the reason I don’t tell her is because I don’t know why I’m in so much pain. And as such, in some weird way, the pain doesn’t feel real.

By the time I was diagnosed with a physical disability later that year, I was in and out of school nearly every day. I finally had a name to put to my pain: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type 3. And because it had a name, I finally felt like I could ask for help.

I requested a 504 meeting with the guidance counselor, the vice principal, and most of my teachers to get some accommodations. In preparation, I wrote a letter. A letter describing all the pain that I had been experiencing and holding in for the past year, and advocating for any number of solutions we could implement so that I could stay in school. I read the letter aloud to my teachers, and tried to avoid the shocked looks on their faces and the pity in their eyes. When I was done reading the letter, my Algebra 1 teacher spoke up. She said that whatever they could do to help me, they would.

A day or two later, my accommodation request was denied. The vice principal had decided that because I was getting good grades, I couldn’t possibly need accommodations. As if to say: “The world isn’t built for you, so we won’t be either.” Painfully, the next day I went on independent study, and never saw my teachers again. I needed to focus on my health, so I did.

Something needed to change, and I changed it.

As I’ve gotten older, this has proven harder to do.

…

Things got better in high school, for a number of reasons. Physically, being on independent study for the spring semester was like a factory reset for my body, which meant that when I started high school my pain got better. Or at least, I had stopped focusing on my pain as much. And in high school I obtained academic accommodations for my disability. In this sense, things were improving. 

However, I never used my accommodations. I didn’t like feeling different, and using accommodations to take breaks in the middle of the school day is not precisely blending in. From my perspective at the time, it seemed as though school (if nothing else, physically) was easy for others, and I wanted to be like them. It should be easy, shouldn’t it? But as the years went on (a brutal four years at that), my feet hit the pavement harder and harder. My bag began to feel heavier, and walking to and from campus proved difficult. All I could think to myself, as I refused to ask for help, was: “but shouldn’t this be the easy part?”

Over time I grew past this mentality. I started to accept that some things, like walking, are harder for some than for others. Which is why, I was shocked when I did the reading by Rebecca Solnit for the first day of the Wilds of Literature class. Solnit, off-handedly, states that walking is the “something closest to doing nothing” (5); “an amateur act” (4); an activity that “allows us to be in our bodies and in the world without being made busy by them” (5). I read this and didn’t just feel sad or angry. I felt defeated.

I can’t remember the last time I wasn’t made “busy” by my body as I walked around campus. I don’t feel like walking is an “amateur act.” And while sure, I concede that, for an able-bodied person, walking may be like the something closest to doing nothing, but to me it’s simply not. “Why can’t things be easier?” I ask myself.

It was then, in struggling to come to terms with the ableist language that Solnit was using, that I realized two things. Firstly, I decided to write about my physical disability for the Wilds of Literature class to, in some sense, put words to my struggling with Solnit’s piece. Secondly, I began to put words to the question “why am I finding it so hard to change?” 

It is hard to change because: almost by definition, it can feel easier to stick to the status quo. It is hard to change because: who wants to be seen as different? It is hard to change because: I feel like I need to push myself harder and harder to get into a good school. And maybe these are bad reasons to not change. They probably are. But at least they are reasons; words I can put on the page and say “Here I am. My experiences are real. See me.”

Unfortunately, I am realizing this in the spring semester of my senior year of undergrad. Unfortunately, my freshman year self still has a long way to go.

…

On my freshman year walk, I asked Ana if we could slow down for a moment. I didn’t tell her at the time, but I had started to feel the hefty impact of my feet against the pavement with every step I took. I needed to slow down, and so we did. We found the perfect people-watching tree to sit on and for a while we just sat there.

After a couple of minutes, it dawned on me just how many people were walking along the Esplanade. For a moment, life felt normal. This moment, seeing dozens of people walking around on a clear sunny day with their friends, their kids, and their dogs. I thought: This is what I want out of my career. I want to end up in a place where I can go for a long walk simply because it’s nice out, or I need a break, or the buzzing returns to my brain. Even if it is in the middle of the day in the middle of the week.

But then it hit me that it was the middle of the day, and the moment felt more solemn. I realized that, when there isn’t a pandemic, most of these people would usually be at work. The kids at school. The dogs at home, waiting for their owner to return. 

I watch people walk by and cynically think to myself that the world isn’t like this. The world doesn’t make space to be human. The world isn’t made for breaks, it’s made for breaking. 

Accommodation requests get denied.

Those at the top of the world find themselves fogged-in by the sky they hoped to touch.

Thunderstorms wipe out cherry blossoms before they ever get to bloom. 

All of these thoughts race through my head when I realize that, while this may be true, it doesn’t have to be. Sitting here with Ana is living proof of that. I told her that I needed to slow down and we did. I made space for myself, and Ana helped me do it. We sat there together and watched the world go by.

For the first time, I admitted to her and myself that something needed to change with how I was approaching MIT. The world might not make space for me, but I could, and needed to, make space for myself.

—

I wish I could say that I changed my ways during the rest of my time here at MIT, but I didn’t. I kept pushing myself harder and harder, and I kept learning that I couldn’t keep up with this. But I never changed. I kept telling myself that next semester I’d take it easier, or that this summer I would get some rest. Yet time and time again, I caved. I caved into a feeling of cynicism; a feeling that I wouldn’t get where I wanted to be in life by “slowing down.”

And maybe I was right to push myself so hard. By now, I’ve gotten into graduate school; in 6 years time, I will have a PhD in mathematics from MIT. It’s what I’ve always dreamed of, and I can’t help but feel like, had I done anything differently, things wouldn’t have worked out the way that they did. Surely there are alternate realities where I practiced better self care academically, but I can’t see it, and because of that it doesn’t feel real.

And yet, something needs to change.

…

I recently met with the professor who will be my advisor in graduate school. I’ve met with him countless times over the years, but this time is different. For the first time, I find myself telling him something I haven’t had the strength to before.

“I have a physical disability.”

“How did having a disability affect your time at MIT?”

“It didn’t. Well, I mean. I couldn’t let it, so. It didn’t.”

Tell him the truth. Tell him why you’re telling him now.

“But, I need to make more space for this in my life as a graduate student. That’s why I wanted to let you know.”

 

It’s out there now. I’ve uttered the words I’ve refused to truly acknowledge for years. I’ve said it outloud. Now, it feels real.

…

Cherry blossom trees bloom once a year, and the flowers last for one to two weeks before the petals fall away making the way for new growth. The flowers signify a halfway point: between a nearly completed undergraduate experience, and the graduate experience that is yet to come. Between what does and doesn’t feel real. 

Sitting beneath the trees, soaking in the springtime smells I know I will one day be nostalgic for, I am ready for things to start feeling real. My friends arrive and we make our way across the Harvard bridge. I’m not expecting this walk to be 20 minutes; if anything, I’m hoping the walk never ends. 

Once across the bridge I went to that people-watching tree that Ana and I went to on our first walk. I made my way to the dirt and sat with my back against the tree. I brushed my fingers against the grass, rustling softly in the wind. I closed my eyes and heard the river water pass by. The sun begins to set, and I breathe in this moment.

My backpack is in my room.

The buzzing in my head has subsided.

And the sky is so clear that, for a moment, I swear, I can see the 100th floor.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/flowers-destroyed-1000x758.png

I Hate the Last,Paige B. '24,4,2024-05-22T00:00:00-04:00,"It’s 9:05am PST. I told myself I’d wake up past 9:14, but either due to stress or due to a (relatively) healthy sleep schedule my senior year, I’m up 9 minutes too early. It’s 9 minutes too early, because in 9 minutes, or so I’ve been told, the early action decisions for MIT are going to be released. I’ve spent the last week stressing over the question: “why in the hell are admissions coming out at 9:14am on 12/14/19?”, as if, if I can’t solve this riddle, I won’t be accepted into MIT. In reality, it’s just because they are releasing the decisions on 12/14 at 12:14pm EST. I sigh a breath of relief and think to myself “maybe– now that I’ve figured out the puzzle– maybe now I will have a shot of being admitted.”

Regardless, it’s 9:05am, and I am awake 9 minutes too early. I decide I will grab my iPad and go to the decision website in anticipation. It’s 9:06 when I think to myself: “I’ll just try putting in my username and password, just to confirm that I remember them.” So, I put in my information, and the webpage says something to the effect of: “WARNING: THE NEXT PAGE CONTAINS YOUR DECISION.” But surely the webpage is lying. The decisions won’t come out for another 9 minutes– no 8 minutes now. But, out of morbid curiosity, I click the button anyways. And I got in.

The beginning notes to Another Believer by Rufus Wainwright begins to play in the background. 
         (0:00-0:37):
      
 “Hello, I got something to tell you \\ But it’s crazy, I’ve got something to show you.”

I go to my kitchen where my mom was making breakfast. I don’t say good morning. All I do, is read her the first line of my offer letter. “Dear Paige, On behalf of the Admissions Committee, it is my pleasure to offer you admission to the MIT Class of 2024.” My mom is shocked and confused (hell, she doesn’t even know that MIT decisions are coming out today), and I start crying, and my guidance counselor on the phone tells me what I already know: my world will never be the same.

When I first started undergrad, I thought about what I wanted out of MIT; the things I wanted to take away, and the things I wanted to leave behind. There’s a world in which I just came here, took my classes, graduated, and left. No more, no less. But I didn’t want that. Or rather, I felt like I should want more than that. MITAdmissions saw me: a first-gen math nerd from
         middle of no-where
      
 California. MITAdmissions took a chance on me.

(0:37-0:50): “So give me just one more chance, one more glance \\ and I will make of you another believer.”

There were certain obvious things I wanted to take away from MIT: making friends, learning math, etc. But when I initially thought about what I wanted to leave behind I came to the following conclusion:

I wanted to be a ghost. I wanted to haunt the halls of MIT.

I wanted to be someone who was here. Someone you would remember when they’re gone. Not even necessarily
         a legacy,
      
 but rather a memory. So that someday, when the light shined through the windows of the fourth floor of Building 2 just right, you’d remember that I was there.

And while in various senses I think I achieved that to some degree, these past few weeks my mind has been elsewhere. These past few weeks, my focus has shifted from what I am leaving behind, to what I am taking with me.

I used to hate the last week of classes. I hated how empty it felt. Either you knew folks who were graduating (or moving onto middle school or high school) and felt sad that you’d probably never see them again, or you didn’t and somehow that felt more hollow. Like, there were people who were living full and intricate and complicated lives, and suddenly they were just going to be gone.

It used to feel easier to ignore these feelings. To say “that’s just how life works” and move on. But that no longer feels true.

(1:13-1:45): “You’ve been on my mind, \\ Though it may seem I’m fooling. \\ Wasting so much time, \\ Though it may seem I’m fooling. \\ What’re we gonna do? \\ What are we gonna do about it?”

Coming into MIT I wanted to be a ghost, but that hasn’t been on my mind this past week or so since I turned in my last assignment. Rather, I’ve been hanging out with friends watching various Shrek movies and going on long walks and realizing that– my friends have become ghosts in my life. Or at least, they will.

I’m going to continue to stay in contact with my college friends, don’t get me wrong. But I keep having these dumb “realizations.” That, this will probably be the last time I am living in the same building with these people who have so deeply impacted me. That, I won’t be able to just walk down the hall and knock on my friend’s door and ask if they want to grab dinner (and for that matter, it seems like ‘real’ adulthood entails eating a nontrivial amount of dinners without your friends). That, though I will be here in two years to start working on my Ph.D, most of my friends will no longer be here.

It’s like I can already see their ghosts. I see them sitting at the table we used to play dungeons and dragons at. I see them in the math lounge eating sweet treats (because they worked hard today and they deserve it). I see them and I think: I don’t know how this (gestures vaguely) happened.

How did I get such good friends? At what point did they go from a person I said hi to in the halls to someone I will never forget? When did I stop thinking as much about how I was going to affect MIT, and started thinking about how MIT has affected/will affect me?

I don’t know. Perhaps I never will. Isn’t that how these sorts of questions always go?

(2:12-2:42): “So then, that is all for the moment. \\ Until next time, until then do not worry, \\ And give me just one more chance, one more glance, \\ and I will make of you, yeah I’m gonna make of you another believer.”

The music fades into the background.

So yeah, as past Paige predicted, I hate the last: the last weeks of undergrad, the last times seeing friends, the “last” blogpost. It’s silly: when I wrote my first MITAdmissions post, I knew that this one (roughly) would be my last. I knew that I’d want, more than anything, for this to not be how it ends.

Take on Me (Acoustic) by a-ha (0:00) starts to play in the background. The camera cuts to me writing this last post in the math department.

Technically, this isn’t going to be my “last” blogpost. There’s one or two more things I want to write about before I am no longer under the “Student bloggers” tab on the MITAdmissions website. I wanted this to be my official last post as an undergrad but that just. That just feels too sad. So I’m going to post one or two more things, and maybe write a blog or two for admissions when I am back as a graduate student. But I guess, this is it, more or less.

I can’t put into words how much this (gestures vaguely) is all I ever wanted. Hell, it’s more than I ever even dreamed of. I guess my guidance counselor was right: my world will never be the same. “How strange, and how lovely, it is to be anything at all.”- John Green

(2:40-3:04): “I’ll be gone \\ In a day or two… \\ In a day or two.”

The camera zooms out. The image of me sitting in the math department writing this post gets smaller and smaller as Killian court, and then the dome, and then nothing but the sky come into view.",,0
[Guest Post] A Note to the Class of ‘28,Ceri R. '16,1,2024-05-21T00:00:00-04:00,"This year, Jeremy, Nikki, and I were in charge of the Admitted Student Welcome and Closing Show—two of the flagship events of CPW. Jeremy wrote a lovely blog post to document all the behind-the-scenes work that makes these shows possible! 

At the Admitted Student Welcome, we usually invite a student leader to help set the tone for the weekend and welcome everyone to campus. Andre H. ’24 gave a great speech that was equal parts fun, wisdom, and honesty about some of the tough parts of MIT, so I asked him if he’d write up a version of it as a guest post for the blogs. And he did! 

Whether or not you’re a part of the class of 2028, I think the advice here is really valuable: wherever you go, whatever you do, remember to check in with yourself and surround yourself with good people. Anyway, enough yapping from me! The rest of this post is all Andre’s words. 

I gave a rendition of this spiel to the incoming class of 2028… still can’t believe I am about to be an alumnus.

What’s Goodie! I’m Andre Hamelberg, I’m a senior majoring in courses 10 and 18. If you aren’t familiar with your course numbers, that’s chemical engineering and mathematics. What most know me for, I was this year’s Undergraduate Association (UA) president!

As a first-year, navigating MIT can be overwhelming. There are so many clubs, activities, groups, and opportunities. My CPW & first-year experience was and will be dramatically different from all others, as mine began during the pandemic from my bedroom. Interestingly enough, MIT always finds a way, so I was still drinking from a firehose trying to figure out the things I wanted to take part in.

As I mentioned, my freshman year was completely virtual and although some of us were on campus in the spring semester, there were very many restrictions as there was still an ongoing pandemic.

hanging out with my friends for the first time freshman year

Following the summer after my freshman year, my sophomore year felt like I was thrown into a fire. All these people I had only seen on Zoom were real—some were tall, some were short— but most notably I had joined my fraternity, Theta Chi, during the pandemic, and now I was living in a house I hadn’t truly seen before with people I had never met in person. I had to find classes and figure out building numbers. And all of this was on top of trying to settle into a completely new environment. 

Now, I don’t say this to scare you all, but I say this to help you recognize this is a time when you can truly explore who you are and what you want out of your MIT experience. For me, I quickly realized I chose the right community in Theta Chi. We quickly coalesced into a tight-knit community. Each night we would have dinners and I’d learn more about my brothers’ backgrounds and felt very accepted and able to share my thoughts on anything. Don’t get me started on our parties…

my fraternity senior class

From there, I slowly tried to find extracurriculars I was interested in. I loved playing sports throughout high school, so after a few months of settling in, I realized that something was missing from my daily life. Funny enough, one of my best friends always joked that I’d make a great wrestler, and me being me, I decided why not try and join the wrestling team. This was another community that I found to love. Although I took some serious beatings in practice, I got better and better, but most importantly I had met a new set of friends and gained a new community that I could confide in.

my first ever wrestling tournament

With all of the things I have done at MIT, I’m most known for my role in the UA, which is our version of student government—“we work to solve the toughest campus issues by collecting student opinion and harnessing students’ problem-solving skills in creating innovative solutions.” If you haven’t seen the banana lounge yet, firstly, go check it out, but that’s the UA in action (shoutout UA Innovation)! It was definitely a huge undertaking, but I will forever be grateful to have been elected and able to serve my classmates well.

On top of the Undergraduate Association and my fraternity, I’m a part of a few other communities. Since my sophomore year, I have worked a 
        UROP
      
in the Doyle group. I will never be able to thank my UROP supervisor, Devashish Gokhale, enough for all his guidance and the opportunity he gave me to learn and do research under his wing. From long hours in the lab, all of our hard work culminated in our paper on multifunctional zwitterionic hydrogels for the rapid elimination of organic and inorganic micropollutants from water. Now, we have begun work to commercialize the technology, maybe one day you’ll drink water cleaned by our hydrogels.

Additionally, I am part of one big family in 
        Course X.
      
 Over the years, we have become super close. A life-changing experience that I got to take part in with some of my Course X family was a Global Classroom program by 
        MISTI Brazil-Amazonia.
      
 We were tasked with designing sustainable packaging for a local business using our knowledge of polymers and all applicable chemical engineering knowledge from our coursework. Not only did I get to create an awesome package design, but I made lifelong friends in Manaus and will be returning this summer to do an internship with MISTI.

These are just a select few of the enriching experiences I was able to take part in. If I listed them all, this blog would never end!

More casually, you can always find me in the 
        Z
      
lifting or hooping for my intramural team. You can also find me chillin’ in the Student Center catching up with friends.

The best advice I would give to you all that I wish somebody told me is to branch out as much as you can. Try new things. Meet new people. But at the end of the day, do not forget to prioritize yourself. It’s awesome to have lots of things to do but check in with yourself often and make sure you are enjoying your time. MIT is the opportunity of a lifetime and you can shape your experience into what you want it to be.

I’d encourage everyone to continue to explore more about your identity and do what makes you happy while here at MIT. I’ve loved every second here besides when psets and exams start getting tough and you all have a lot to look forward to. I am going to miss the spontaneity of life around MIT—the last-second spring break trips, the ability to walk outside my room or take a few steps outside to meet up with my closest friends—and it’s something I will forever remember.

Before I sign off, I want everyone to know that I’m always available! In the near future, if you find yourself in the Big Apple, reach out! I am always a message away. Good luck class of ‘28, I know you all will do great things!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/andre-1-800x1067.jpeg

Backstage at the CPW Closing Show,Jeremy W.,0,2024-05-19T00:00:00-04:00,"“Other duties as assigned” is a concept well-known to admissions officers; it’s a catch-call term used by employers to encompass all the miscellaneous tasks an employee may be required to perform outside the scope of their stated job description. Of all of the other duties I’ve been assigned, running the CPW Closing Show is by far one of my favorites.

As many of you know, each April MIT Admissions hosts Campus Preview Weekend. During CPW, a thousand prefrosh descend upon the MIT campus to participate in more than 700 events over ~3.14 days—everything from How to Build an Underwater Robot and Extreme Karaoke to fire spinning and a Python bee. Think of CPW like the Olympic games, just with more math and fewer sports.

The same staff that is responsible for admitting students is responsible for hosting Campus Preview Weekend. So once decisions are out, the admissions office transitions out of Committee Mode and into Events Mode, carrying out all the logistics of CPW: transporting students from the airport, assigning students with an overnight host, orienting students to campus, and managing many of the weekend’s events.

While we have a dedicated internal team that oversees CPW planning (more on them later!), each member of the admissions staff has their own portion of CPW to oversee. For the last few years, my main CPW responsibility has been running the CPW opening and closing ceremonies, officially named the Admitted Student Welcome and the Closing Show, respectively. Coincidentally, I am part of a long legacy of admissions staff bloggers who have managed the CPW shows: Mikey ran the shows for many years, until DJ and I took over. Then it became the Jeremy and Kellen show, and eventually I enlisted Ceri and her unmatched Big Theater Kid Energy to help me.

This year, Ceri and I reached our most powerful form yet, adding Nikki to the team. This is a behind-the-scenes look at how the three of us we ran the 2024 CPW Closing Show.

Logistics

As the saying goes, “The road to showtime is paved with many logistical hurdles.” Months before we get to showtime in April, the opening/closing show team has to plan every aspect of the show: venue, staff, performances, rehearsals, sound, lights, safety, creative direction, and more. A combination of Trello, Google Sheets, and Slack helps us get the work organized.

This is just a selection of some of the tasks on our checklist leading up to the show:

- Formally reserve the performance space (Kresge Auditorium) from the MIT Campus Activities Complex

- Secure technical support and production managers for lighting design and audiovisual support

- Confirm participation of MCs, speakers, and any special guests

- Reach out to student performance groups and confirm their participation, length of performance, staging requirements, and lighting and sound needs Is playback audio needed? What is the stage setup? Do the performers need chairs, stands, or other props? Are the performers setting up the stage, or do they need assistance? Does the performance have timed lighting cues? Has the playback music been reviewed to make sure the content is appropriate?


- Is playback audio needed?

- What is the stage setup? Do the performers need chairs, stands, or other props?

- Are the performers setting up the stage, or do they need assistance?

- Does the performance have timed lighting cues?

- Has the playback music been reviewed to make sure the content is appropriate?

- Organize a soundcheck and rehearsal for every performer

- Assign MIT Admissions staff to be “bouncers” and ushers for the event Bouncers have to be trained on the emergency protocol for the building, as well as accessibility features of the space, like the wheelchair lift

- Compile a final run-of-show document, outlining each performance, all lightning and sound cues, and stage directions

Kresge Auditorium

Securing the right venue is crucial. Because most of the students at CPW choose to attend the Closing Show, we need a venue that can accommodate an audience of over 1,000. On MIT’s urban campus, there are only a handful of spaces that can support such a large audience. Typically, we plan months in advance to reserve Kresge Auditorium (MIT’s main performance space) for the Closing Show.

(We’re not so lucky for the opening ceremony of the weekend, the Admitted Student Welcome. Since Kresge is typically already reserved for use by the Music & Theater Arts Department the day of the opening show, we must transform Rockwell Cage—a renovated United States Government airplane hangar-turned-gym—into makeshift event venue. MIT Campus Activities Complex works their magic to build us a temporary stage, set up a few stacks of bleachers, and arrange 700 chairs on the floor of the court, while MIT AV tackles the difficult task of designing a speaker setup in such a way that maximizes sound quality and minimizes echo of a massive airplane-hanger-turned-basketball-court.)

But for the Closing Show, we are blessed with Kresge. With 1,067 seats, a full lighting and sound booth, rehearsal rooms, an equipment lift, and backstage wings, Kresge is an ideal venue for our variety show. It’s also worth noting that Kresge is architecturally significant, a well-known work of celebrated Finnish-American architect 
        Eero Saarinen.
      
Dedicated in the 1950s, this mid-century modern masterpiece was one of the first large-scale applications of thin-shell concrete technology in the United States. Math nerds revel in the fact that Kresge’s reinforced concrete dome comprises one eighth of the surface of a sphere.

With a seating capacity of 1,067, Kresge Auditorium is MIT’s largest auditorium. An additional 157 seats can be added by eliminating stage space and arranging chairs in the front.

Backstage and the booth

Every production is made possible by the tech crew—and in the case of the Closing Show, we hire E33 Productions (an MIT student-run production group) to run lights, and MIT AV to run sound and manage the projector screens.

Here’s a peek into the Kresge tech booth during sound check, where you can see Zoma on lights, and Justin on sound:

Shout out to Justin and Zoma for holding it down up in the booth.

This is what the folks up in the booth see while MIT Lion Dance is rehearsing.

While the lighting and sound techs are up in the booth, Ceri, Nikki, and I are calling the show from backstage. Everyone refers to the run-of-show spreadsheet we put together, which provides minute-by-minute cues of all the moving parts of the show.

6:05 PM: Pi Day video plays on mid-stage screen (7 minutes runtime) A/V: PiDayVideo2024.mp4 (video with sound) Lights: Blackout while video plays

During the show, we communicate in real time between backstage and the booth using fancy wireless intercom system of beltpacks and headsets. While we mostly stick to what’s written in the run-of-show, having the headsets helps us communicate any unexpected changes, provide reminders, and ask for assistance.

“Lion Dance on deck…E33, blackout stage lights…cue lights for performance…run playback!”

“Lion Dance on deck…E33, blackout stage lights…cue lights for performance…run playback!”

Soundcheck is one of the most important steps in putting on a successful show. Six hours before showtime, Ceri, Nikki, and I posted up in Kresge while each group arrived for their scheduled rehearsal time. For groups like the Logarhythms, an a cappella ensemble, soundcheck is crucial to establish the correct balancing for their intricate microphone setup. And because each of their songs has a different sonic style and physical arrangement on the stage, adjustments need to be made between each piece. After a bunch of tweaks to their handheld and area mics, our sound guys had the Logs sounding great.

During the soundcheck for Video Game Orchestra, we positioned ourselves at various locations around the auditorium to offer feedback on how to balance the levels of the instruments. Even though I am not an expert on sound design, many years of being in musical ensembles actually came in handy, as I was able to help VGO adjust to the acoustics of the auditorium. It’s both an art and a science.

“We could use more strings, and less keys. Snare, can we have you at 75% volume? You’re drowning out the strings.”

“We could use more strings, and less keys. Snare, can we have you at 75% volume? You’re drowning out the strings.”



For other groups, soundcheck was less about sound, and more about the physicality of the stage. Some groups were familiar with the Kresge main stage, and for others, it was their first time performing there. For example, during the Mocha Moves dance rehearsal, their dance captain made repeated adjustments to expand their choreographed formations to fit the size of the Kresge stage. Their last performance had been in a much smaller venue, so this soundcheck game them the chance to adjust.



(Thank you, Ceri, for capturing me cosplaying Kris Jenner in the thank u, next music video off to the left.)

This may be obvious, but since we’re busy calling the shots from backstage, we don’t actually get to watch the show. In fact, with all these years running the shows, I’ve never actually had the chance to view the Closing Show from the audience. During the performances, our best chance to view what’s happening on stage is to sneak a glimpse from the side wings. Here’s my view of MIT Bhangra’s performance from the stage-right wing:



Setlist

We were fortunate to have a great slate of student performances this year that featured a broad range of talent within the MIT community. But with dozens of performance groups at MIT, it’s a always challenge to determine the final selection of performers. Ceri, Nikki, and I first met in January to discuss our options, and after weeks deliberation and coordination with various groups, we landed on this year’s show—a mix of music, dance, and cultural performance ensembles.

First, we decided to cold-open with a screening of this year’s epic Pi Day video, Beaverheimer. But instead of screening the normal version, we edited a special CPW edition that included a new surprise ending.

After the Pi Day video finished, we moved right into the first act: the MIT Video Game Orchestra making their CPW Closing Show debut! VGO graced us with live renditions of Coconut Mall from Mario Kart and Merry-Go-Round of Life from Howl’s Moving Castle. (Also, living legend and Tetris Champion Justin Yu is a member of VGO, so we were already huge fans!)

After VGO was done, our unparalleled duo of MCs, CPW coordinators Lauren and Trinidad, joined the stage to welcome the crowd. (To stay on theme with the Video Game Orchestra, Lauren and Trinidad came out on stage dressed in off-brand Mario and Luigi costumes. For legal reasons, their costumes were officially in the style of “Italian Plumber Brothers.” Scroll to the end for proof.)

The rest of the evening’s performers included:

- Rambax MIT kicked things off with an energetic, interactive performance of traditional Senegalese drumming rhythms

- Mocha Moves sustained the good vibes with a lively hip-hop dance routine. (As a Millennial, I have to admit that their mix included Timbaland’s The Way I Are, a classic from when I was in high school.)

- The MIT Logarhythms captivated us with an ambitious a cappella setlist: Don’t Lose Sight, Love on Top, and Here Comes the Sun.

- MIT Lion Dance stunned with an acrobatic performance of the traditional Chinese art form that blends dance, percussion, and ornate costumes.

- MIT Bhangra finished out the show with a high-octane performance that had me out of breath—just from watching!

- Of course, it wouldn’t be a CPW Closing Show without inviting the biggest star of them all: Dean Stu Schmill!

After Bhangra wowed us with their impressive cardiovascular endurance, we closed the show by announcing the winners of the annual 
        CPW Meme Competition.
      
We invited the winners on stage to be officially crowned the memelords of MIT.

And with that, the 2024 Closing Show was a wrap. We started the day in Kresge at noon for soundcheck, 8 hours later we had put on a show! I want to thank Ceri and Nikki for being great collaborators on this year’s show, and Trinidad, Lauren, and Julianne (the CPW coordinators!) who made the entire weekend possible. A special thanks goes to the unsung heroes of the show, our technical staff up in the booth and backstage. Thank you, Zoma, Jim, and Justin.

I leave you with this exclusive photo of the 2024 CPW Closing Show team. Catch you backstage next year!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kresge1-1000x750.jpg

[Guest Post] We’re Not in Kansas Missouri Anymore,Andi Q. '25,1,2024-05-17T00:00:00-04:00,"Claire S. ’25 is a Computation & Cognition (6-9) major from Missouri. She’s one of MIT’s small-town and rural student ambassadors – part of the larger Small Town and Rural Student (STARS) Network, which aims to connect high school students from those backgrounds with top colleges. This network is brand new this academic year.

“Where do you want to go to college?”

There it was again, the dreaded question high-school-senior-me didn’t know how to answer. So I gave the only response I knew for sure: “Definitely not in a big city.”

I’d spent my entire life in a small town in Missouri, and I enjoyed the peace, friendliness, and comfort that came with it. Comparing that to my experiences in places such as New York City and San Francisco where everything was too busy, too loud, and too aggressive, the answer felt obvious. But I applied to colleges using the “throw everything at the wall and see what sticks” strategy, including small towns and big cities alike.

As you can probably tell by the fact that I’m writing for, well, MIT Admissions, things didn’t go the way I’d planned. I’m writing this in my dorm room overlooking the city of Boston. Ultimately, I decided to sacrifice the comfort of a small town for all MIT had to offer. And I’m very happy I made that choice. But that didn’t mean my transition was without struggle.

View of Boston from my room in Simmons Hall!

So here, in no particular order, are three things that were most difficult for me to adjust to:

- Struggling to find people with my background. As early as freshman orientation, the difference between me and my peers who had grown up in bigger areas was obvious. Most times when introductions were made, people said they were from the Bay Area, New York (by which they just meant NYC), etc. Groups formed very quickly during orientation of people roaming Boston together, while I was still trying to get my bearings and figure out how to use public transportation (the “T”). I started to wonder if I’d find anyone who shared my experiences and if I was missing out on the friend groups forming because it was taking me longer to adjust. (Spoiler alert: I have since found people who have similar backgrounds at MIT. And it was okay that I needed longer to adjust to Boston—I had four whole years to take advantage of things here, after all.)

- Not comparing myself to others. When I first heard about the amazing things my peers had done before college, I felt like I wasn’t enough and was less deserving to be at MIT. People talked about working at leading cancer research centers or lobbying the nearby state legislature or playing in nationally- or world-renowned music groups or a multitude of other things I couldn’t have done coming from a small town. It took me time to realize this wasn’t a reflection of me or my abilities but was instead a matter of circumstances. It wasn’t fair to compare myself to anyone else because my circumstances were out of my control, and I made the best with what I had. I’m just as deserving as anyone else to be at MIT—after all I made it in, didn’t I?

- Homesickness. Out of all the difficulties that come with moving away to a big city, this actually wasn’t one I expected. I figured with phone calls and text messages and FaceTime, I would be able to stay connected with my home and be fine. Homesickness certainly isn’t unique to students from small town backgrounds, but I think being so far away from my family and the community I’d built for 18 years combined with the fact that my new environment was so much different definitely made things more difficult. I remember returning to my dorm room some nights my freshman year and wishing there was someone for me to just exist with. I’ve found the best way to deal with this is to find a community at MIT that can become a sort of home, too. For me that’s the Mock Trial Team. I have absolutely no desire to be a lawyer, but the people on the team really are the best, and I’m so grateful for them. <3

Not everything about my transition to a big city was negative, though. I was pleasantly surprised with a lot of the opportunities it gave me. Without further ado, here are five (yes, five!) of the things I’ve really enjoyed about Boston.

- Entertainment. The closest major city to my town is St. Louis, which is two hours away. That made for a four hour round trip any time I wanted to go to a concert, play, or sporting event and required planning far ahead of time. Now those venues are so much closer (Fenway Park and MGM Music Hall are only a twenty minute walk), and my friends and I can be more spontaneous. I’ve gotten to see musicals such as Hamilton and Hadestown and artists such as OneRepublic, AJR, Dua Lipa, Andy Grammer, and Tai Verdes all passing through Boston!

- Nine dollar tickets. To Red Sox games. Just for college students. $9 is barely enough to cover a Dunkin’ run, but I can get seats to a baseball game for that much?? This year, a friend and I took advantage of the deal and went to Opening Day at Fenway Park. If you’re a baseball enthusiast like me, this deal is too good to pass up.

- Research. I mentioned one of the things I felt like I missed out on back home was research, but there are so many opportunities in the Cambridge/Boston area. My sophomore year, my academic advisor (Dr. Ann Graybiel, a really cool person doing really cool research in neuroscience) offered me a position in her lab. I spent a semester training a neural network to track and cluster the movements of mice with certain brain disorders. It was a great opportunity because it gave me hands-on experience and helped me decide if I wanted to do something similar in the future. I’m majoring in Course 6-9 (a combination of computer science and neuroscience), so this research felt perfect for me, but there really is something nearby for any interest! Training a computer (with pretty colors as markers) to track the movements of mice for my research project!

- So. Many. Students. One of the cool things about Boston is the high concentration of college students. There are more colleges than I can count in the area, which means you’re bound to find people your age interested in the same things as you. For me, this has included getting to play with talented music ensembles, finding other young creative writers, and participating in hackathons. Hackathons, which are events where students get together to solve some problem in a short period of time, are happening constantly and draw from colleges all over the Boston area (and sometimes all across the country!). I’ve participated in HackMIT, which is a large-scale programming-oriented hackathon, and a Brain-Computer Interfaces Hackathon where we tried to use brain signals to control robotic vehicles. There are also medical hackathons, education hackathons, VR/AR hackathons, and many more.

With all that being said, there are still things I love about home. Whenever my parents pick me up from the St. Louis airport and we embark on the two-hour drive home, I love looking up at all the stars I couldn’t see in the city. When I step out of the car outside our house, I’m always hit by the stillness and peace of the nature around me. 

Home in the winter

But one of the things I’ve learned recently is that you don’t have to choose between the two. You don’t have to discard your identity when you come to MIT. In fact, I’ve found holding on to my background has helped me in college. Coming from a small town has taught me to make my own opportunities, and that’s especially useful in a big city where it can seem easy to become part of a crowd. My background has also kept me grounded. While cities like Boston can feel more focused on a hustle or career-oriented culture, my town ingrained in me that there’s more value to a person than their success. This has kept me from feeling anxious about grades or job prospects and helped me fight off the imposter syndrome that affects so many people here. 

Now, I’ve found a place where I can both celebrate my background and help other prospective students celebrate theirs through a new small town and rural student ambassador program at MIT. The program is part of the larger STARS (Small Town and Rural Student) Network through which several top colleges strive to connect with students from those backgrounds. Helping with the program has been very fulfilling because I remember being in high school and wanting advice from people with similar backgrounds to me. I remember it being hard to find similar people who had chosen the path I wanted to take. I love that STARS allows me to be that source of guidance and advice for other students. 

So, if you do decide to make the leap from a small town to a big city, don’t feel like you have to give up your background to fit in. Celebrate that part of your identity, but also embrace everything your new environment has to offer.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/442678100_1520953108767463_5288057193394632596_n-800x600.jpg

Guitar Hero… on the oscilloscope!,Andi Q. '25,4,2024-05-14T00:00:00-04:00,"“Wow, MIT has a class about digital instrument design now?”, my advisor exclaimed as he looked over my registration at the start of the semester, “That’s so cool! I would’ve loved that as an undergrad.”

“… oh wait, it’s about digital musical instrument design, not like oscilloscopes and stuff,” he said after reading a bit closer, “That’s, um, still cool I guess.”

Well, Joe, I’m pleased to announce that for my 6.2060 (Microcomputer Project Laboratory) final project, I’ve recreated Guitar Hero using an oscilloscope as the display.

A digital instrument played on a digital instrument!

Some background

Guitar Hero

Guitar Hero is a rhythm game where you strum notes on a guitar-shaped controller in time with some music to simulate playing a guitar. The notes are shown as circles moving down a virtual fretboard, which you play when they reach the bottom of the screen.



I chose Guitar Hero for this project for several reasons:

- It’s dynamic, fun, and one of my favourite rhythm games.

- It’s a cultural icon, so most people probably know what Guitar Hero is.

- The graphics are relatively simple and abstract.

- An MIT music professor created the game.

Due to time and hardware limitations, my recreation is a very simplified version of the game, but I think it still preserves the original’s spirit!

Oscilloscopes

Fun fact: This beautiful oscilloscope from Keysight costs more than 4 years of MIT tuition. (We don’t have any of these at MIT, unfortunately)

Oscilloscopes are incredibly useful tools that measure and display voltage signals, which allows engineers to characterize and debug circuits. Normally, they plot these signals against time. This mode of operation, called Y-T mode, is great for visualizing the signal’s shape, and it is generally the only mode you’d need for most electronics projects.

A voltage signal I measured from a motor after I spun it.

There’s also a second, lesser-known mode of operation called X-Y mode, where the oscilloscope plots two voltage signals against each other. X-Y mode allows you to visualize how “out of phase” (i.e., out of sync) two signals are by drawing an ellipse on the screen. Not terribly exciting, until you realize that X-Y mode is basically a very high-tech Etch A Sketch.

By carefully controlling how the two input signals (x and y) vary together:

Blue is the y signal; pink is the x signal

You can draw line art of pretty much anything you want!

X-Y mode render of the previous two waveforms

Oscilloscopes are also insanely fast, so you can even animate things by slowly changing the input signals over time. This was one of the key ideas behind my project – using my little microcontroller to generate these signals in real time and feed them into the oscilloscope.

The idea of using an oscilloscope to render a video game is not new. Many early video games used this display mode, and some oscilloscopes even have Tetris as a built-in easter egg.

Putting it together

With this background in mind, let’s see how everything fits together. There are no physically moving parts in this project, thankfully (I’ve learned my lesson from my 6.2050 project last semester), but I still needed to:

- Render the game on the oscilloscope.

- Communicate wirelessly with a controller.

- Load and play music from an SD card.

- Load “charts” (game files storing the song’s rhythms and notes) from an SD card.

The special part of 6.2060 is that we get to build the circuits and code that power these components! It was kind of painful, but still fun in a uniquely MIT way.

Graphics rendering

For this project, we got to work with the PSoC 5 (short for programmable system on a chip) – an incredibly versatile little microcontroller made by Cypress Semiconductor. It’s a mixed-signal chip, meaning it allows you to work with analog and digital signals on the same microcontroller, which was pretty amazing.

The PSoC 5 has many, many convenient little devices built into it, like four digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Using two of these DACs, all I needed to render something on the oscilloscope was a list of x and y coordinates in my code.

To generate this list of coordinates, I first represented each game object (mostly notes) as a “sprite” – something with a position coordinate and a pre-defined list of “shape” coordinates. I’d have ~15 visible sprites on the screen at any given point during the game, which I’d then “flatten” into a single list of coordinates by connecting them with lines:



I also wanted to be fancy and display the game at a slight tilt, just like the original Guitar Hero. To achieve this, I had to put each point through a “perspective transform” (i.e., multiply it by a matrix):



I could then repeatedly loop over this list of coordinates and output the appropriate voltage levels to the oscilloscope.

Game controller

All the prior labs in 6.2060 made me hate wires, so I used Bluetooth to connect the controller (also made using a PSoC 5) with the console. This was also plug-and-play (just like the DACs), so I laser-cut a custom shape for the controller to make it a bit more impressive:



However, I accidentally designed the controller to be left-handed. I’ve never played a real guitar before, so I placed the buttons in a way that was most comfortable for me to hold. Only during playtesting did my friends point out that most people hold guitars in the opposite direction. We all agreed it was pretty funny though, so I kept this left-handed layout.

Music playback

Music playback turned out to be much harder than I had originally anticipated. When I first pitched this project to Professor Leeb, I assumed I could just store MP3 files in the PSoC’s internal memory and play them directly… somehow. However, he pointed out two big problems with this approach:

- MP3 files are compressed and require complex algorithms to decode.

- Even if I had these decoding algorithms, the PSoC’s internal memory was far too small to hold more than a few seconds of audio.

He suggested I use WAV files (a raw audio format) and an SD card instead, which would fix these two problems and allow me to load new songs on the fly. This was indeed the correct way to play back songs, but I still had some more work to do before I could get any output from my speakers.

The PSoC doesn’t have enough power to drive a speaker, so I needed to create an audio amplifier to supply this additional power. The circuit schematic for the audio amplifier looked kind of scary:



But it turned out to be a very cute little circuit that all fit on one tiny breadboard!

My friends think this photo looks AI-generated, but I assure you it’s real

Finally, I was able to hook up some speakers to my system and listen to some crisp, CD-quality music.

Chart loading

After implementing all the previous items, the last thing left to do was to import some existing Guitar Hero charts to play on the system. Thankfully, there’s a large online repository of these charts, which was super convenient.

The biggest challenge I encountered here was getting the timing just right. I had to calibrate a few songs manually for the project demo, but other than that, it works!

With all these components in place, I finally had a fully functional system:

I never thought I’d feel such happiness from seeing a few circles moving down a screen.

Challenges along the way

Of course, oscilloscopes and microcontrollers were not designed to play Guitar Hero, so I encountered two big challenges that almost killed this project.

The first was that I only had access to digital scopes, while oscilloscope-based games generally run on analog scopes. This might not seem like a big deal – after all, digital scopes are superior to analog scopes in many ways – but how they measure and render signals makes a huge difference when trying to render an animation.

Analog scopes use a continuous voltage measurement to trace an electron beam across a CRT display. This approach yields a super high (basically infinite) resolution and reacts to changes in the signal almost instantaneously. In contrast, digital scopes sample the voltage very rapidly (but not continuously!) and reconstruct the signal from those samples. This approach allows you to make fancy measurements on the signal that wouldn’t be possible on an analog scope but significantly worsens the resolution, speed, and maximum measurable frequency.

This tradeoff is usually not noticeable, but in my case, it just makes the graphics look… kind of bad, depending on which oscilloscope I used. Even worse, I couldn’t just average the signal for a long time to smooth out the image because of the real-time nature of the game!

The digital scope also limited my frame rate to 20 FPS. The signals I was feeding into the oscilloscope were very complex, so it couldn’t reliably display them when I went any faster. 

This video demonstrates this effect, but here’s what it looked like in my initial tests:

Look at all those hideous rendering artifacts

More rendering artifacts (i.e., the faint lines between the notes)

Luckily, human eyes are pretty bad, so it still looked decent after all this.

Still, I tried to create an optimized rendering algorithm to counteract these rendering effects, but that’s where I ran into my second problem – the microcontroller I was using struggled to handle all the intense computations I threw at it.

By the time I started optimizing the rendering algorithm, the microcontroller already had to:

- Read and play audio data from an SD card 44.1 thousand times per second.

- Compute the positions of 10+ game objects 20 times per second.

- Handle controller input 9.6 thousand times per second.

Because the microcontroller can only do one thing at a time, it can only output to the oscilloscope in the microseconds-short windows between these three events. Optimizing the rendering algorithm would only tighten these windows and potentially make the image flicker.

Furthermore, the microcontroller is about 250× slower than the computer you’re reading this blog post on, so even small slowdowns significantly degraded the game’s performance.

In the end, I created an algorithm that reduced the rendering artifacts but was still far from optimal. Ironically, this algorithm worked better on slower oscilloscopes that would theoretically render images worse.

Although these challenges almost killed my project, they were really what made this project so fun to work on. And they gave me plenty to discuss in my lab report!

As I write this blog, I realize that osu!lloscope would have made for a much better project name. Oh well, I suppose that will just have to be someone else’s final project in the future.

Update: Professor Leeb and all the TAs loved the project! Here’s one of the famous final project videos that they film each year.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/guitar-hero.gif

chasing the aurora,Kanokwan T.

A chase for the beautiful is one I can’t pass on.

the adventure

Cait and I talked about how grateful we were about this whole experience. We were lucky to live in a city that had 24/7-accessible rental cars. We were lucky to live in an area where the aurora was visible. And, we were lucky to have friends eager to go on excursions like these.

"Cubes, Tetrahedrons, and Wind Chimes",Andi Q. '25,2,2024-05-05T00:00:00-04:00,"“Everyday objects suggest amusing controllers” – Perry Cook

“Everyday objects suggest amusing controllers” – Perry Cook

This semester, I’m taking 21M.370 – Digital Instrument Design! It’s a new(ish) music technology class about using microcontrollers (Arduinos, ESP32, etc.) and various sensors (accelerometers, capacitive sensing, etc.) to create fun new interfaces for musical expression.

Professor Ian Hattwick encourages us to go wild with our imaginations, as long as the end product 
        produces some kind of audio
      
. Bonus points 
        if it sounds or looks good too
      
! So here are a few silly instruments I’ve designed throughout the semester (although I haven’t had the chance to build most of them… yet).

Tetrahedron

I think we can all agree that the triangle is the pinnacle of acoustic musical instrument design. It’s hard to imagine improving such a flawless design, but with the power of hot glue, it is indeed possible!

Tetrahedron is an instrument made of four triangles glued together:

Behold.

Although the glue would dampen the triangles’ acoustics, Tetrahedron would account for this by using a microcontroller to amplify the sound, much like an electric guitar.

But why stop there? Icosahedron is an instrument made of twenty triangles glued together:

Behold (x5).

Five times the triangles, five times the music.

Rockin’ in the Wind

Do you ever hear wind chimes gently jingling in a calm breeze and wish they’d sound more like plates breaking or a metal pipe hitting the ground?

Rockin’ in the Wind is a set of electric wind chimes that makes that wish a reality. When two chimes collide, they complete an electrical circuit, which a microcontroller can detect and trigger sound effects to play.

Bonus points if you use a hairdryer to play the instrument!

If you prefer less chaos, Rockin’ in the Wind can also play regular musical notes. These notes are tuned to a pentatonic scale, so it always magically sounds good. And thanks to the microcontroller, these notes can sound like any instrument, from the kettledrums to Vocaloid.



HuMIDIfier

We often use piano keyboards as MIDI controllers in electronic music because they’re familiar and easy to use. But plain old keyboards are so boring!

HuMIDIfier turns the human body into a MIDI controller, using an accelerometer to detect steps on a virtual piano keyboard. Kind of like the foot pedals on a pipe organ.

The inspiration behind HuMIDIfier

HuMIDIfier is extra chaotic because you can’t actually see the piano keys when you’re using it, but that’s the fun of this instrument.

Music Cube

MIT’s new music building is best described as three featureless brown cubes. (I suggested painting them bright pink like the Teatro Amazonas in Brazil, but the music department wasn’t having it.)

In honor of this new building, Music Cube is also a featureless brown cube, made of six copper squares hot glued together, with wires poking out the sides.

C U B E

Using these wires, you can suspend the cube between your hands. Each face on the cube then acts as a button that plays a sound when touched.

Music Cube is one of the few instruments on this list that I actually ended up building. And surprisingly, playing it felt quite natural! I performed Saint-Saëns’ The Swan on it as a nod to the very first lecture, where Ian showed us a performance of the piece on the theremin.

There’s also a secret fifth instrument that I’m using as a final project in a different class. That one deserves its own post when it’s ready, so stay tuned for that!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_54AC8800820A-1-400x339.jpeg

I painted a mural for Borderline!,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",6,2024-05-05T00:00:00-04:00,"Since coming here, I’ve had two items at the top of my bucket list. #1) Graduate. #2) Paint a mural for The Borderline @ MIT. I got to finish one of these last night!

Borderline is a project that started in 2017, where students cover the walls of one of the campus tunnels with murals. Some of these are also animated! If you use the Artivive app and hold your phone up to some of the paintings, they’ll come alive with AR animations that students have also contributed. For the sake of brevity and giving credit where it’s due, you should check out the official site and see the cool stuff that people have done.

Almost every night this semester has involved staring at statistics problems and Google Colab. And that’s been fine with me—this is my first academic year where I’ve actually enjoyed my technical classes for the most part. Even then, I still wanted to make more time to draw, so I was really excited when Borderline opened up artist applications.

Draft

This was what I submitted for my application. There really is no hidden message other than: “I smashed a bunch of my favorite things together.” I also didn’t have the confidence to paint a human face on a wall.



Sketch



I had to flip the drawing so it could fit the space that I was given. I stood on a ladder which was both fun and intimidating, but that meant I couldn’t frequently step back and look at how the sketch is going. That’s why some of the details and proportions ended up different from the draft.

Color

I haven’t painted a mural before, so I wasn’t sure what kind of paint I should use. There were cans of wall paint, as well a box set of acrylic paint tubes that you’d find in an art classroom.



To get the straight edges for the background, I blocked off the border with masking tape that I peeled off when I was done painting.

Because I was curious, I tested the tube paints, and…



Ew, not what I wanted. I stuck with wall paints for the most part.



I had to get a hang of mixing wall paint. My first attempt here didn’t quite match the original colors of the draft, and the fuzzy edges showed how tired my hands are getting.



By the second day, I was getting a grasp of things. I got the right colors that I wanted, and I was getting brave enough that I was changing some details.

grimace shake 2.0



[baseball tangent] She was supposed to be a Dodgers fan, hence the blue hat and shirt design, but I didn’t want to commit to it for a whole painting. I only follow the Dodgers because Freddie Freeman is on the team, and I only know him because he used to play for the Braves, which I’m a long-time fan of (I was born in Atlanta).

Lineart



It was weird to do color first and lineart second, since that’s the opposite of how I usually draw. Doing it with a tiny brush was harder than I thought it would be, having to keep it wet and consistently wiping paint clots off.

Finished product!



And done! I’m pretty darn happy with how this turned out.

For funsies, this is a playlist of the mostly 90’s-00’s music I listened to while I worked on this. Shuffle recommended.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/draft-800x965.png

i stole a vhs player!,Kayode D. '27,6,2024-05-03T00:00:00-04:00,"Two weekends ago
      
 was CPW, or Campus Preview Weekend. A lot of really neat events happened, but I was 
        in the trenches
      
 with homework and exams. I have a lot of half-written blogs that I want to get out in the near future, but for now, i want to share what I consider to be “the most exciting thing i did over CPW.”

 

I stole a vhs player.

I have a habit of buying/getting things that I don’t need. Like at all. Last semester, I bought a cassette player, an old landline telephone, and a 30 pack bundle of Halloween Pokemon cards , even though I never play the game and I have yet to even open them all. All were completely unnecessary, but I found their simplicity so cool!!!

My biggest kryptonite has to be record shops, though. Specifically 
        Newbury Comics
      
, but I also spend a considerable amount at Cheapo Records, a record store super close to MIT campus. I went there a few weeks ago and ended up buying a VHS tape of the movie Hamlet for 2 dollars. I could practically hear my dad’s disapproving voice in my head as I spent what little money I had on this obsolete thing I would never use. 

Hamlet!

Little did he know that I would turn to a life of crime. I was doing 
        laundry
      
 in Simmons, and was waiting in a lounge for it to finish. Behind the tv, in a pile of wires and junk, I found a VHS player!! It was awesome and cool and probably from 2002 when Simmons was built. I tried to get a better look at it, but found a steel anchor attached to the back that tied it to the wall. Aw rats. It’s almost like someone intentionally put that there so people don’t steal. 

Lucky for me, though, someone broke the anchor!! So now it’s 
        mine
      
!!

I also “relocated” a TV from the floor 7 lounge, which has 3 unplugged tv’s in an unusable position against a wall. So now one is getting a new life!! I set it all up in my room and me and my roommates set up to watch some Hamlet!

You know on tv when old people make fun of young people for not being able to use a rotary telephone or a VHS player? That’s because it’s hard. I had to look up which way was forward on a 
        VHS
      
. I had to look up how to make the VHS player show up on the tv (it had to be on channel 2 for whatever reason). And then we had to sit there and watch the tape rewind for 45 minutes at a slightly faster speed than the movie ran at. I see why people complained about tapes being returned and not rewound. It all makes sense now.

And the movie sucked! It was so boring! Hamlet is a boring movie!! It’s a beautiful movie, and the sets were stunning, but it’s a very boring movie. It did have Mel Gibson, though (you know, the guy from Chicken Run, 2000?) so that made it a little better. 

 

Record Store Day!!

Last weekend was an event called Record Store Day. Artists from all over support local record stores by releasing exclusive merch/limited editions of records at only these stores. My friend, Noah R. ‘27 convinced me to go, and we embarked to Harvard Square to visit some stores. 

The first store we went to was called Planet Records, and my friend, Caleb M. ‘27 would describe it as “a wikipedia rabbit hole incarnate.” Some would call it cozy and homey, others might call it cramped and cluttered. Either way, if you like music and stuff like that, it’s a cool place! I got some cassette singles for like a buck each, and then found some sick cassettes (!!) pictured below. I also found a 1 dollar 3-VHS blind bag, and quickly realized why it was only 3 dollars.

Then we went to a place called Armageddon Records, which stressed me out so I didn’t take any pictures. It’s very metal and punk, and I ended up getting 2 VHS tapes (Apollo 13 and Gladiator). It was just a lot, and I realized that I was trading legal tender for the products I was acquiring. I miss finding things in closets and behind old tvs.

We went to Shake Shack after this. It’s like a regular burger place but they have 15 dollar burgers and no soda (that I could tell at least). Boy do I love Boston!! It was really good food, though. I thought it would be like Steak and Shake, which apparently isn’t a thing everywhere. (My town had a Steak and Shake, and it is sort of like a 50s diner but today. They have good shakes and the rest of the food is pretty mid, but my friend worked there and he said a guy came in onetime claiming to be the “King of Steak” and all the teenage workers treated him like royalty. Long live the King of Steak.)

Of course, we ended the day at Newbury Comics (because you know I can’t resist). My funds were running low and I was absolutely torn on what to purchase. I was split between getting the American Football 1999 debut album 
        DELUXE EDITION
      
 and getting Modern Baseball’s “Modern Baseball Presents: The Perfect Cast EP” along with “Motorcycle.LPG” by Slaughter Beach, Dog. Both of these are amazing works of 
        music!!
      
 Also, they were specially colored pressing, which only made it even cooler. 

I was at the store until it closed  and ended up getting the American Football Album. I don’t regret my decision (too much) and I’ll appreciate this deluxe edition for years and year to come. Now I just need a record player…

 

Swapfest!!

Swapfest is like a big monthly garage sale at MIT, but for technology stuff. Vendors come once a month and sell stuff in a big parking garage near campus. There’s computers, phones, electronics stuff, music, cameras– if it is “technology” they probably have it. I was really excited for it, since this was the first one of the year since last November. Only one problem: 

I had no money. I spent it all on things I didn’t need (shocker) and now just had to look at things I wanted. My biggest regret of the day was not buying a video camera that looked like a gun. I mean it didn’t look like a gun, more like a barcode scanner, but still. 

A positive though: I saw not one, not two, BUT THREE copies of Side Pocket, my favorite game on the SNES. 

Side Pocket

Last semester, me and some friends who I will colloquially call “the boys” decided we were going to have a video game night one Friday. We set up the the aforementioned 7th floor lounge with 3 TVs and played Fortnite and Jedi Old Republic. We chatted about the state of New Hampshire and the longstanding impact that Fortnite has had on our generation. It truly was a grand old time. Other members of the friend group, who we can call “the girls” showed up about an hour in, and sat with us. 

Me and my roommate eventually booted up the classic games selection on my Nintendo Switch and began to play through some old titles. A little ways in, we came to Side Pocket, a billiards simulator for the SNES released in 1993. It was great because it was a game we both quickly understood, but the limited console capabilities made the playing field super even and a ton more fun. The soundtrack was absolutely insane, and it was the perfect quaint little game. We played for a little while and just chatted and had fun. 

The girls, on the other hand, hated this experience and loathe the game of Side Pocket. One person described it as “Kayode and Bryce sitting in front of the TV and saying ‘oh darn’ or ‘i didn’t expect that to happen’ for an hour and a half.” They say it was really boring to watch. 

But I loved it! I miss it, and want to do it in the future. A part of me wonders if we lost what made games great when we upgraded with modern games. The community that was built over Tecmo Bowl has been replaced by faceless online play. I think that online play is still good, but I long for the drive and urgency to gather and play games together in a friend’s dorm room or on someone’s couch.

And has science gone too far? Has the improved graphics taken away the creativity and imagination that came with playing games? One of my favorite games of all time has to be Zork, a text based adventure game made by MIT students in 1977. It has no graphics, and you have to take notes as you play. One of my favorite high school memories was at the end of senior year, where me and some friends made a big map and would play the game during any free time, just trying to solve the puzzles and escape the massive Underground. We refer to this time as Zorkathon, and I miss it.

But that’s a blog for another time, I guess. I’m really tired. This semester is almost over, and I have a lot of blogs to post in the next few weeks. Until next time, partners.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vhs-Hamlet-400x533.jpg

browser archaeology,Fatima A. '25,8,2024-05-03T00:00:00-04:00,"inspired by Alan’s browser archaeology post, I started looking at the tabs open on my phone to see if such a post would be worth doing. it was then, looking at the over 1500 tabs open, that I realized that I had likely not closed 
        any tabs
      
 in the last 3 years, since I got my phone.

after closing the many repeated tabs of instagram, NYT games, gradescope, canvas, “<enter any city I have lived in the last 3 years> weather,” that I got it down to about 1300, which is still pretty bad.

then, I just decided to write about the most recent (I think?) 105 tabs open, because why not! will follow a similar format to Alan’s post :)

tote bag tour,Gloria Z. '26,3,2024-05-02T00:00:00-04:00,"I don’t know how it started exactly–a nice lug of canvas here, a floppy rectangle of yellow there. I tried my best to retreat under the guise of functionality: this one’s dark enough to hold tubes of paint, and that one’s foldable enough to take on the go, I cried silently. I need something sturdy enough for my laptop and all of its accessories–and something short enough to swing from my grasp without scraping the ground. That one’s the perfect size for my A5 notebook, and that one’s big enough to hold my winter jacket… Each one just a little different, just enough to justify their place on my designed tote bag command hook. But soon I could hide no longer–I was in it for good, and I wasn’t going to stop. And that… that was the beginning of the end.

ok basically I have a lot of tote bags (25 exactly) so here are all of them:

the ones I use the most

these are my daily drivers, my day ones, my most functional and (relatively) neutral color palette bags

the ones I made

(mostly)

the rgb trio

title says it all

spring picnic vibes

imagine these paired with a cheese board and 70 degree weather

graphicscore

like they have big graphics on them you know (I’m trying to come up with categorizations)

more bags i got for free

aka the rest

That’s all of the bags I have… for now. But I’m always trying to get that bag so I will continue to keep my eyes peeled.

(I do actually use most of my totes, but I also just enjoy collecting them as functional mementos of a place or event I’ve been to. I think it’s nice how they come with those memories, and then you build more with them as you use them. Also they’re so easy to store and bring along on trips and outings!)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_8379-800x800.jpg

an orange tour,Kanokwan T. '26,5,2024-04-29T00:00:00-04:00,"Last year, I hosted a pre-CPW 
        livestream
      
showing the Class of 2027 orange things around campus. Red was too abundant. Grey wasn’t that compelling. I went down the list, and orange felt just right: rare enough to be interesting, common enough to take us all around MIT.

To inform our orange agenda, I polled my dorm for orange recommendations—results here. Ever since this tour, I’m now a little more delighted when I find orange around me. Isolated color is a fun lens in which to view the world. I hope you find some joy in it, too.

P.S. For context, I didn’t film this livestream with the intention of ever posting it later on (i.e. publishing this blog). Also, sorry about the East Campus murals section being soooooooo long. It’s easy to lose track of time with pretty murals. I promise I end up walking to many other places (16, precisely). Feel free to skip around the video as you please.

Flipping Failure,Paige B. '24,0,2024-04-28T00:00:00-04:00,"This IAP, I took part in a writing workshop at MIT known as Flipping Failure. In this workshop, I and other participants worked on developing a ~5 minute (true and personal) story about challenge and resilience at MIT. After debating between a couple of topics, I chose to tell a story about struggling with sacrificing self-care to prioritize academics.

You can read the transcript here. This story is also accompanied by three strategies I thought were helpful.

There are a number of things I could discuss about this experience, both from the storytelling workshop (which was amazing and I highly recommend applying for next year if/when they run the program again) and about the story I told. But ultimately, I want to let this story speak for itself, so I think I will leave this here.

The one thing I will say is this: I got a lot out of writing about my experience at MIT– the ups and the downs. I am glad I got to be a blogger over the last two years, and am happy to have had the chance to share my garbage with the world. If you think you might like this experience too, and you will be an undergrad this upcoming school year at MIT, maybe consider applying to be a blogger when the application opens this summer :eyes: (an email will go out about it and it’s always advertised via the blogs).",https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bo1jMdwIVoQ,1
packing for the road,Amber V. '24,0,2024-04-27T00:00:00-04:00,"A few thoughts from this week–

The rapid onset of graduation seems to be hitting this week. Last night my friends and I wandered from B1 to Skullhouse, for a hospital-themed birthday party complete with bags of fake blood and medicine bottles on string lights. I chatted with a friend who urops at my lab about our research over gluten-free cake in the basement. I went to get water and two people were switching shirts in front of the sink. I’m going to miss nights like these.

Then we trekked to Xi, a gender-inclusive fraternity with strong east side vibes. I came in, took off my coat, and was immediately challenged to an arm wrestle. But before my would-be opponent and I could find a suitable table, someone else called me to help wrestle for fake money. I came to help and managed to wrangle the money away. Then a bunch of people around a poker table saw my handful of plastic Ben Franklins and invited me to buy in.

I caught up with a few people, and climbed to a couch suspended from the ceiling, before the party ended and we had to walk home.

I’ll be ready to say goodbye, but not this week. Not yet.



I went running today, bleary-eyed from staying up til four am. I’m so thankful that I’ve touched so many spaces at MIT, and that those spaces hold room for me to be and to grow.

I’ve been thinking about how it’s okay to be in different spaces, especially dorms, at MIT. There is a narrative, I think, of fitting in to one dorm community completely, that you can find a living group of all your people once you get to MIT. I’ve seen how this is true for some. But for me, the people that reflect different parts of me are actually spread throughout campus, and there’s no way I could have met all of them in just one living community. Some of the people I vibe with deeply wouldn’t live at EC, and others I would have only found at EC — and the same is true of B1.

When I moved from EC to BC, I kept circling around the question, would I have chosen this if not for EC renovations? Would that choice have been easier if renovations didn’t force it on me? In the end I’ll never know. I chose EC my sophomore year, and I am glad I did; my MIT experience would have been less colorful without it. I am so glad I chose B1 as well; I’ve met some wonderful friends here, and found a community I cherish. I choose B1 now every day that I hang out in the 41, scroll through the chat, and rally for floor parties on weekends.

At one point, I regretted not being able to be someone who lived 4 years on one hall, or even in one dorm. But that’s okay. No one in my year could have spent 4 years on B1, or any floor or hall of BC or EC. I would have liked to live some traditions four times — but I lived them two or three times, I felt the cyclical nature, the traditions as new to me as the fact of changing seasons. I got a taste of them, and that’s enough for now.

I’ll taste it again at alum events. I’ve crossed to the other side of east side culture — from wide-eyed freshman looking in, to cruft wistfully looking back — and in some ways it feels like a dream again, one that cannot be truly captured, that was never real, or only was a long time in the past.

I wonder if, in time, all of MIT will feel that way to me. The dream of a time when nobody slept, and every moment in good company had a certain glow.

My time here won’t end abruptly. It will go slowly, with a whisper; ever since East Campus closed I have felt it begin to erode. Leaving B1 at the end of spring will be another hit. But some pieces will remain for a long time. I’ll be taking classes here next year; I’ll feel the ache of long hours at psets and in front of machines, the joy of working with a good team.

I see alums everywhere — at AfroShake, at Skullhouse last night, at the East Side Festival. At events, generally. So I will be able to return, but in the way that I return to Tucson: as a traveller stopping by, seeing the places that left their mark on me, where stories pile up and collapse and unfold. I see stories rise in alums’ eyes when they re-enter the halls of EC. I was here. This was mine once.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PXL_20230801_232606306-400x533.jpg,1
"CPW: ASA Midway, B1 B1athalon, and Cutting Crafts with Contour",Amber V. '24,0,2024-04-25T00:00:00-04:00,"CPW was so much fun! I meant to get this blog up and running beforehand, but I was too busy prepping for all the events I lead or helped with! Here’s how they went.

Contour

My team and I held several events to show adMITs the software-free laser cutter, called Contour, that we built last semester in 
        2.009.
      
 

After 2.009, nine of us continued working on the project. We’re called Contour now, not Pink Team, and we’re still figuring out how much of our name to capitalize. We’re digging into market research, learning the ins and outs of team formation, and testing our product with potential users.

We held several events to show adMITs our laser cutter, teach them how to use it, and generate hype for MechE. When I entered MIT, I had no idea I’d get as invested in building things as I currently am — I wanted to inspire frosh to see what they can build after a few years at MIT!

I’ve become one of two co-leads on Contour, and I spearheaded the organization and logistics for our three events. The team all worked hard to make this happen — UX prepared posters, stickers, and keychains, Software did several overhauls on the code to make it more robust, and the other co-lead helped run and prep for events. I love working with this team; every time we have a deadline, I feel at once that my work is needed to get it done, and that I can depend on everyone to push until the work is done.

look at him. he’s so beautiful

The day of the last and biggest event, “Discover Making and MechE with CONTOUR,” we had an especially ambitious goal: we wanted to have adMITs cut whatever they wanted on the laser cutter. We’ve tested with a few outside people, but never a crowd of creative teenagers, and we were curious to see what people would come up with and how they would respond to our constraints. We set up our wood and paper, keychains and stickers and candy in the MechE Lounge, expecting about twenty people to stop by over the next two hours.

Instead, there were about seventy.

AdMITs who were all much taller than me filled the MechE Lounge, so much that getting from one side to the other felt like moving through a crowded dance floor. Their bodies blocked the light from the laser cutter; their voices covered the hum of the motors. People poured out of the MechE Lounge and filled the hallway.

This was glorious and terrifying. I warned the back half of the line that the wait would be long. Contour takes about three minutes to cut out a small shape, so realistically we only had time for about 40 people to cut out their drawings. And that didn’t account for drawings that weren’t designed for laser cutters, or times the 
        CV
      
 software messed up.

And sometimes the software messed up. We spent the first hour and a half with a sub-optimal set-up that led to a number of errors. After we switched things around, we could catch most errors early on, and cutting out shapes went a lot more smoothly.

Once we got Contour on a roll, it worked so well! I loved watching the machine we’d built cut out so many designs.

viking boat dragon I drew

By the time the event was over, there were still 24 hopeful adMITs. Some were holding multiple sheets of paper for their friends.

Almost all of the team had to leave. There was just one person on Software left, and me. But we felt bad sending the adMITs away, when they’d waited so long. We kept cutting out projects for a half hour or so. Then my teammate had class, leaving me alone with the machine and small handful of remaining adMITs. I took over and kept cutting their projects.

I was impressed by how creative everyone was. Some students were clearly artists, and beautiful, complicated shapes came easily to them. Others had no art background at all, and came up with creative ways to design interesting shapes. There were a lot of beavers and Wide Tims traced from phone screens.

I finished cutting adMIT projects about thirty minutes after the event ended. Then I cut my own viking ship. Finally I cleaned up (another team member skipped a meeting to help me cart all of our supplies back), and began to rush to another meeting, thinking how I’d barely have time to grab food on the way… when I found a bench with five trays of Anna’s Taqueria. I grinned. The free food gods were rewarding me for my labors.

I loved the adMITs’ energy. They asked good questions about MechE and the workload at MIT, and I felt that as a senior, I was able to answer those better than I had been before. My answers weren’t universal — but I tried to keep them unbiased, to be clear about what biases I might have, and to emphasize the many paths different students take.

I was left with a lot of insight and a lot of questions about where to take Contour from here.



Meet the Bloggers

I’ll be at our very own Meet the Bloggers, where we wear shirts with our faces on them, eat pie, and meet adMITs. The blogs have been such a wonderful thing to be part of these last four years. The bloggers were one of my first communities at MIT, during the covid year, and they were one of my strongest connections to the Institute when everything was shut down. Writing blogs taught me to tell stories about myself, to capture pieces of the real world and preserve them, which is different from writing reflections of the world in fiction. This skill has been so useful in blogging, poetry, and monologues. 

I talked with Jeremy about careers and PhDs. As I grow older, Jeremy and other staff have become the people in the blogger community I know best. I felt a bit older, a bit less entertained by whatever quirky thing I’d done – though interesting to imagine all the different ambers there could have been. Some people have an inevitability to them, if they went to [redacted] university they’d be much the same. But you – who would you be in Tucson? Who would you be in art school?

I didn’t have the words for it then but I do imagine those women – me in Tucson who might have learned to go to frat parties but wouldn’t have found spaces like B1, a group of majority queer, majority women who become the life of any dance floor. In Tucson she wouldn’t really emerge from being more of a nerd than most people around her. I thought of myself in 
        art school,
      
 my art getting better; maybe I’d be published by now. I’d be terrified for my career after the rise of AI. I don’t know who exactly I’d be.

But in the meeting room I thought, I like the MIT version best. 

bloggers, met

ASA Midway

Walking through Midway and talking to pre-frosh for a club was warm and bittersweet. I hadn’t been in that space since my own CPW in 2019, and again during sophomore REX. This time I knew so many people! Some of my friends have exec roles on 
        AAI
      
 and 
        BSU
      
, and I learned that some of my teammates from MechE projects are also on 
        Casino Rueda
      
 and 
        Divest,
      
 and friends I knew from classes are apparently in BioMakerspace and 
        Mocha.
      
 The list goes on, but you get the idea. I love the interconnectedness of MIT, how many passions people pour their time into.

There was also a sort of nostalgia to passing by clubs I find compelling but never had the bandwidth to join. I wondered how my dancing or singing abilities might have improved with three years of dedicated practice. I’ll have more time to learn new skills after MIT, but finding spaces to learn with will be much more difficult. Mujeres Latinas and LUCHA also stood out to me; I’ve signed up for their mailing lists at various times, but never really went to meetings. I’ve found Latinx culture in my dorm communities and friendships instead. I know I can only be deeply invested in so many communities, and that I didn’t have the bandwidth for clubs until senior spring — but that may be different next year, and I looked up Hispanic graduate school clubs that evening.

Burton One B1athalon!



The 
        B1ners
      
 turned the Burton One hallway into an obstacle course and sent adMITs leaping over chairs, ducking under tables, and shooting nerf guns into a target. Sofia and Jonathan directed the set-up and running of the event. They’re both underclassmen, and it was awesome to see them take charge and know that the floor will keep going strong after the seniors are gone.



We ran the B1athalon on Thursday and Saturday night. On Saturday, some adMITs mentioned wanting to go to a party, so we started a party in the 
        flounge.
      
 Music blasted down the hallway right outside. I hung out in a nearby suite with Selena ’24, a fellow B1ner, and about 10 adMITs.

Some adMITs had questions about life in the dorms: was it loud? How long did parties go for? If you’re not on the meal plan, 

Other adMITs were all worn out of questions and were simply drinking in the vibes, making conversation, or planning their next move. Some were trying to find pancakes; others wanted to make a karaoke event.

Other B1ners came and we discussed life, the universe, and everything.

When I went to sleep around 2 or 3 am, some of the adMITs were still talking with each other, sitting on the rug in our flounge. Some were choosing between MIT and another college; others were committed. Some of them may never be in that room again, and maybe some will end their weekend nights on that rug for years to come.

thoughts on math@MIT!,Fatima A. '25,1,2024-04-24T00:00:00-04:00,"I asked a bunch of people, professors, current and former students why they do math and their thoughts on the MIT math department. Here is what they had to say!

Short introductions! 

Jonathan: My name is Jonathan. I joined the department as a postdoc last year. I’m interested in topology, which is the study of flexible shapes like knots or rubber surfaces. We can’t use the traditional geometrical measurements like length or area to characterize these shapes since they aren’t rigid. So we develop more robust measurements like counting the number of holes in the shape. 


(let’s call them) Z: I’m a recent MIT alum who majored in 18, and now in a math PhD program.

Carl S. ’23: I’m Carl, and I’m a first-year math PhD student at Stanford. My main interest is extremal combinatorics, but I’m also interested in analytic number theory (and maybe some other analytic things).

Tristan S. ’23: I’m a 2023 graduate of the math and music majors, currently a master’s student at the University of Cambridge.

Matthew H. ’25: Hi! I’m Matthew, a ‘25 who lives in Next House. I’m a former Californian who enjoys playing tennis, chess-related activities, and watching local sports teams. 

Misheel O. ’25: I’m a junior at MIT studying math and CS, and I watch anime and 
        stuff.
      


Zimi Z. ’25: I am a third-year student in course 18C (Math with Computer Science). As the name of my major suggests, I do a lot of things involving math and computer science and both.

Why do you do math?


        Professor Cohn
      
: One of the things I love about math is that we’re all on the same team. Of course I’m not the world’s greatest mathematician: I’ve done some interesting mathematics, but there are others who are more accomplished. If math were a competition to be the best, I might as well give up now, because I have no hope of “winning math” (whatever that might mean).

Fortunately, that’s just not how it works. If someone else proves an amazing theorem, their achievement doesn’t make my work any less interesting or significant. Instead, the more we learn, the more fascinating and valuable mathematics as a whole becomes. We’re all working together to figure out the answers to questions we share an interest in. As in all human activities, there’s occasionally competition for jobs or prizes, but competition is not the point of mathematics. Other mathematicians are my friends and colleagues, not my rivals.

The reason I want to emphasize this is because of how incredibly successful MIT students have been in the Putnam exam (see here). There are many amazingly quick and insightful students at MIT, and I think people sometimes get the impression that success as a math major must mean being able to come up with ingenious solutions to carefully posed problems under time pressure. That’s an impressive skill, but it’s not the most important skill a mathematician can have, or necessary for success. It’s important to celebrate achievements in math competitions without letting them overshadow other forms of promise or achievement.


Jonathan: I enjoy the mystery of it. You’ll often see some patterns that you can’t explain, but after working hard to understand the objects better, the patterns become natural and inevitable.

Z: I’ve been interested in math for basically my whole life, initially through math competitions but now for the math itself, which I find both interesting and beautiful.

Carl: I’ve pretty much always been more interested in math than anything else. This has maintained since I was about four years old, despite the fact that what “math” means has changed a lot — from arithmetic to short-answer questions to olympiads to college classes and now to research. I’ve essentially followed the “path of most math” for most of my life up to this point: I considered studying CS or physics in college, but liked math more; I explored quantitative finance and software development, but preferred research math. I’m pretty happy with where this path has brought me, and there’s nothing else I’d rather be doing.

Matthew: I like the combination of intuition and rigor–I believe the former is more important to me, but I think being able to understand concepts from the ground up is satisfying. I also think that understanding the explanations of various phenomena through math is something that I value, which is why I take a lot of classes in subjects that aren’t math, but involve math to a reasonably high degree (for example: I took Systems Biology, where a large focus of the class was understanding how systems of molecules that regulate each other behave, which can be modeled using dynamical systems.)

Misheel: I like doing math because I like the idea of figuring things out and/or understanding things. It’s really hard to say really general stuff, but if you assume a small number of reasonable things (axioms), then suddenly those concepts connect together and you get an explosion of connections and new concepts that you can learn and explore. I also play a lot of video games (or used to before college lol) so I like making video game analogies. In this case, the axioms are sort of like a seed for a world in minecraft and you explore what grows out of that seed and do cool stuff.

Another analogy is that research in general feels like exploration as well, like exploring every corner of a room before moving on, and I enjoy that a lot. Running a 
        dfs
      
 in some 
        sense.
      


Zimi: Good question, I don’t know if I would call myself someone who “does math” as I have not engaged too much in math besides taking classes. I take these classes mostly because they are fun! I have not participated in a math UROP or 
        DRP,
      
 which is honestly something I regret a little.

What do you think is one of the hardest things to get right in math pedagogy? 


Jonathan: Math is very interconnected, and the best way to learn a subject is to get acquainted with examples and intuition from neighbouring areas. So it’s difficult to teach math in a linear way! I wish I could continue my classes with students after a couple semesters, and circle back to old material with new context from other subjects they’ve learned.

What are your thoughts on the math department at MIT? 

Jonathan: It’s really nice being surrounded by people (students and faculty alike) excited about math and working on such interesting problems!

Z: The MIT math department (including both pure and applied) is one of the best in the world, and in particular the undergrad math population has been insanely strong the past few years (see Putnam results…). It’s also worth mentioning that the standard course offerings are pretty comprehensive compared to other schools (I think), and usually well-taught.

Zimi: Math is one of the bigger departments at MIT so you get to meet a lot of people with many different interests!

What are your favorite things about the math department at MIT?

Jonathan: cookies at tea time

Z: I really appreciated the variety of course offerings, which covered everything I could dream of wanting to learn (and much, much more). Also, the other math majors: I learned a ton from the friends I made.

Carl: The MIT math department is rather large, and there’s a great breadth of interests represented at every level (undergrad students, grad students, faculty, etc.). This makes MIT a great place to figure out what (within math) one is interested in. I also like how, by and large, the faculty genuinely care about the quality of the teaching.

Tristan: My favorite part of the math department is the active community of students willing to talk about anything math. It’s always great to have peers who are excited about the same things as I am!

What are your least favorite things about the math department at MIT?

Jonathan: cookies at tea time – I think I’ve eaten too many.

Z: The fact that there are so many strong math majors makes it very easy to fall through the cracks, which can make coursework and life difficult.

Carl: There are so many undergraduate students who are interested in math, which is fantastic! Unfortunately, many opportunities that the math department offers (UROPs, DRP, 
        SPUR)
      
 are resource-constrained, and the upshot of this is that they end up being available mostly to the students who came in with a lot of background, or who have very visible and measurable accomplishments to distinguish them from the crowd. This means that, while some students get fantastic opportunities and support, some get very little. I believe this dynamic also pushes some students out of considering mathematics, which is a shame.

Misheel: MIT doesn’t have good infrastructure for grad students and undergrads to intermingle. For example, from what I have heard, Harvard students share their lounge with the grad students and they learn a ton from them. But on the other hand, the benefit at MIT is that the undergrads intermingle better. Still I think if MIT opened the grad lounge to undergrads it would be good XD

Zimi: The administration of the department seems to be a bit out of touch with the undergrads and there seems to be some divide between people who did a lot of math before coming to MIT versus people who maybe did not have as much prior exposure to say, competition math, but are just here to learn math.

What is your favorite math class you have taken at MIT? 

Z: I liked a lot of them; two of them worth singling out are 
        18.783
      
 and 
        18.785,
      
 which I found to be organized and taught very well. Plus, I thought the material was fascinating.

Carl: Certainly the most influential class for me was 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Yufei Zhao. I loved the course, and, a few years on, it’s more or less defined my research interests.

Tristan: My favorite math class at MIT is 18.225 (Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics), taught by Professor Yufei Zhao. I knew little about the subject before taking the class, but the course content helped me develop intuition and skills that are quite useful for both the topics covered and also math in general.

Matthew: It has to be 18.675, which is “Theory of Probability.” This class focuses on building a rigorous framework to understand what it actually means to define a random variable, and what it means to take the expected value of something, and finishes by talking about interesting topics such as martingales and Brownian motion. I’ve always been more interested in learning about more discrete forms of math (e.g. probability, theoretical computer science) and abstract algebra (group theory, field theory, etc.), but I think this class really made me appreciate why the fields of analysis and measure theory are important. Before I took this class, I had some vague operational notion of what probability meant (“if I flip this coin a bunch of times, I expect it to land on heads around half the time”), and this class taught me how to define probability rigorously. It also doesn’t hurt that a lot of concepts from this class showed up in my research this semester.

Misheel: I loved 
        18.786,
      
 which was taught by my advisor, and it was 
        even heavily
      
 algebra-oriented than other iterations of the class.

Another class I really liked is 
        18.102,
      
 which was taught in a really fun way by Professor Melrose. I loved the fact that it was the intersection of algebra and analysis (or just the fact that it has really interesting algebra lol).

What is your least favorite math class you have taken at MIT? 

Z: I hate to say it but 
        18.404,
      
 but ONLY because I discovered I was personally not really interested in the content after all; the class itself is very popular (for good reason) and organized very carefully. I’m still glad I took it, though.


Any thoughts on how to best work with people with many differing backgrounds? 

Jonathan: People with different backgrounds often have different names for the same thing – try to learn as many of these names as possible.

Z: (Unfortunately I don’t have too much experience with this.) My only experience with something like this at MIT came from taking 
        18.821.
      
 My teammates were extremely friendly, accommodating, and hardworking, and we were naturally interested in different aspects of our projects so there were no conflicts :P.

Tristan: When working with people from different backgrounds, it’s useful to get an idea of what type of things different people work better at. For example, mathematicians in different areas might bring different techniques to the table, and some might be able to be applied to various parts of the problem.

Did you ever feel at any point that you didn’t belong in the department? Did that ever go away? Why/why not? 

Z: I experienced this freshman fall and was very intimidated by many of my classmates. For me the feeling did disappear eventually, because somehow I gradually became friends with some of those people, and found they were very friendly and willing to help me with math (and of course, they were normal people outside of math). I think I was pretty lucky, though.

Matthew: To some extent I have always felt this a little–I think that I really enjoy studying (some areas of) math, but at the same time I don’t feel like I really committed to taking many math classes–I enjoy taking classes from a wide range of courses (CS, biology, physics, math). I think the math department also tends to consist of a lot of students who are double-majoring in other fields because the requirements to be a Course 18 are relatively not as strict to satisfy, and I do have many friends (hi Fatima!!) who are Course 18s, so in that sense I do feel like I belong.

Zimi: Fun fact: when I first declared my major I thought I was going to be in the 
        EECS
      
 department/more closely associated with EECS for some reason. So I was very surprised when I received an email addressed to “new math majors.” Before starting college I didn’t really think about studying math, so it took me a while to get used to calling myself a math major. 

Sometimes I do feel like I don’t quite belong here. This feeling was stronger in the first two years in college—I didn’t do a lot of math in high school, so seeing people who were taking advanced classes and knew each other from high school math competitions was a bit fear-inducing. But there are a lot of other people in the department without too much background prior to coming to college. As I said before, I still wouldn’t consider myself someone who “does math,” but over time, I found myself feeling that I belong here more than I did in the beginning.

What are some skills you have found to be most useful as a mathematician? 

Jonathan: This is not exactly a skill, but I’ve found it helpful to approach problems from a computational or a geometric/visualization perspective. But probably the most useful skill is figuring out how to interest other people in solving your problems!

Z: Passion and interest in the material is probably the most important for me, as it makes it much easier to find motivation to work. It’s also important to be willing/able to think very carefully and thoroughly, especially when first working with proofs. I also found it helpful to be unashamed to say things like “I can’t because I have to pset.”

Carl: Being able to look at a problem from different perspectives. So much of research mathematics is staring at a very hard problem and having no idea how to attack it. Solutions, when they come at all, often come from unexpected sources. (I think this can be explained by conditional probability — if a problem is interesting, conditioning on it not having been solved, progress is more likely to come from an unexpected idea than a standard one.)

Tristan: I think that being able to communicate effectively is extremely important to doing math. It’s easier to collaborate that way, to convince others of the correctness of your argument, and to teach math.

Matthew: I think being able to struggle on problems for long periods of time without giving up even when becoming frustrated is important–often problems can take a while, and it can feel like you’re getting nowhere. This seems to be true of many difficult things though, so I think this is just generally useful at MIT.

Misheel: Talking to people! Maybe this is specific to me, but I’m kind of bad at 
        actually doing things,
      
 but a lot better at coming up with random ideas (most of them useless ones). So having someone to bounce and filter ideas and essentially “storing ideas externally” makes working on problems and stuff much better and way more fun. Also talking to people is a useful skill in general and later on in life if you want to collaborate with people. I think being able to write well is a really powerful skill as well.

What is the most rewarding part of your job/doing math? 

Z: Kind of a lame answer, but mostly just the math itself. The friends are cool too but occasionally mid.

Carl: Going from being utterly mystified by something to understanding it, even just a little.

Tristan: The most rewarding part about doing math is getting to talk to other people about it. When I’m done with a cool problem or just finished learning something new, I always look forward to talking with peers about it, understanding the subject better and sharing our excitement over math.

Misheel: The feeling of learning cool things and making cool concepts connect in cool ways. The exploring aspect. Understanding someone explain super high level math and recognizing a few words you learned recently and then using those words in a sentence where it kinda makes sense is very cool.

Anything else you would like to add!

Z: Do math! math is good

"cleats on feet, smile on face",Emiko P. '25,5,2024-04-23T00:00:00-04:00,"Spring season has started, and guess who got to lace up their cleats and practice for the first time in eight and a half months? You guessed it: I did!

Since my injury in preseason this past fall, where a collision in our scrimmage against Harvard left me with a broken bone and a partially torn ligament in my right foot, it’s been a physical and emotional roller coaster. As a junior, it was a bit tough to sit on the sidelines and watch the season slowly slip through my fingers. I remember going to the trainer right after the scrimmage, thinking my foot was just a bit bruised. When they told me I should start wearing a boot, just in case, I couldn’t help but cry – I didn’t want something I had worked so hard for to be taken away by a stupid, split-second collision. Little did I know that I would get well-acquainted with that boot over the next two months.

My first X-ray had great news: no broken bones! The follow-up MRI, not so much. The bone I had broken was so small that it only showed up on an MRI. Even worse, my Lisfranc, the ligament holding my foot together, was simply not intact. It was not fully torn, thank goodness. If it had been, I would’ve been looking at a surgery that would leave me unable to put weight on the foot for three months. Nevertheless, I was in a boot for two months, and I felt totally trapped. I’ve been playing soccer almost non-stop since first grade, and this has been the longest I’ve ever not played my sport.

It was weird to have my body struggle so much with something I did naturally my whole life. Instead of walking, I was dragging, hopping, or sliding around if I didn’t have my boot on. And even once I finally was free from the boot, I had to relearn how to walk properly. I had developed funny walking habits from wearing the boot: swinging my leg like a club-footed pirate and limping a bit because my feet were at different heights. Despite that, I finally felt like a great weight had been lifted from me.

After the boot was off, it was months of physical therapy. Putting weight on the foot was a scary and mighty endeavor. The thought of running seemed so far-fetched. The thought of smashing a ball with my foot seemed even more impossible. As my foot improved, and as the limp vanished, every step felt just a bit lighter. But I always had my eyes set on the end goal: playing soccer again.

Fast forward to now: the start of spring season. For the first time since August, I’m going to the locker room and lacing up my cleats – me lacing up the cleats, not watching everyone else do it – and it’s already a dream come true. Putting on the practice jersey, bringing my ball out to practice – all of it is so simple and routine, but suddenly it now seems so special.

I’m not fully 100% yet. I’m building back to playing for long periods of time, because my foot gets pretty sore after playing a lot, so I am only allowed to play for about half a practice. I also can’t play full contact yet, which means that I can’t run into other players and can only do more technical drills like passing and dribbling.

But here’s what I can do: I can run now. Not even just run, I can sprint. I lead my own line at warmup, because now is when the juniors start taking over the leadership role from the seniors. I can pass, not yet smashing them as hard as I used to, but I’m building up to it. I can play keep-away, I can juggle, I can dribble past mannequins, and I can do it all with my team.

I finally feel like an athlete again, and throughout all the eight months of recovery and hardship, that is the feeling I wanted to regain the most. As the spring season continues, and as the days grow longer and warmer, I hope that my progress also continues. I hope that all the work I’ve put in will continue to pay off.

Something I will always be grateful for is that, when soccer suddenly disappeared, I had an entire community to lean on. My teammates, coaches, and the athletic trainers were there for me every step of the way, asking me about my recovery progress and never letting me forget that I was still a part of the team. Thanks, guys :)

Any kind of injury – or unforeseen setback, really – is so incredibly tough. Something changes just like that, and suddenly there is a before and an after. Clawing your way out of that mess, building yourself back up, is a day-in and day-out effort. It’s like melted down iron that must be reforged and rehammered into shape. Even though I am still on the road to recovery, I finally feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have learned to treasure and love the daily things, the routine things. And I have also learned that if something is taken from me, I will do my very best to get it back.

That’s all for now! I gotta go get changed for practice :)

Lessons from Loomis and Whitney,Paige B. '24,6,2024-04-23T00:00:00-04:00,"Unfortunately I don’t think I will be talking about the duality between points and lines that Andi alluded to in his post on duality (though maybe I will later this month/semester we will see). But this is a post for MITAdmissions Math Month, and thusly there will be some math. And perhaps some thoughts about life at MIT too. If you’re not as interested in the math stuff, you can scroll on through to Part 2 where I talk about some thoughts about life at MIT :). The math in the first part is some material I learned (and still love) from the UROP I did the summer after my first year at MIT.

Part 1: The Loomis-Whitney inequality (aka the math part)

Take your favorite set of finitely many points out in the plane, i.e. in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Let’s call this set $A$. Now, suppose we look at the “shadow” of $A$ on the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, and let’s call these sets $\pi_x(A)$ and $\pi_y(A)$ respectively. If it helps you to see it written down mathematically, we have the functions $\pi_x(x,y) = x$ and $\pi_y(x,y) = y$. See the below diagram for further clarity.

Projections of the point (x,y).

One question we can ask is the following: If we only know about the size (i.e. how many) points there are in the shadows of $A$, can we get a good bound on $A$ itself? The answer, in 2-dimensions, is quite immediate: Yes. For every point in $\pi_x(A)$, we can draw the corresponding line that maps to this point under the projection, called the fibers of this projection. Similarly, we can draw every fiber corresponding to $\pi_y(A)$, and we will notice that the set $A$ must lie at the intersection of the fibers from the $x$-axis and the fibers from the $y$-axis (depicted below).

The set A here (in green) is contained in the fibers of its projections onto the x and y axes.

To write this down mathematically, what we have proven is that \[A \subset [\pi_x^{-1}(\pi_x(A)) \cap \pi_y^{-1}(\pi_y(A))],\] and as such, we have that \[|A| \leq |\pi_x(A)| \cdot |\pi_y(A)|.\] Or, if you prefer more directly, we have \[A \subset \pi_x(A) \times \pi_y(A),\] (though this won’t generalize in higher dimensions– at least not what I am going to present in higher dimensions). I.e., the number of points in $A$ is bounded by the number of points in the projection onto the $x$-axis times the number of points in the projection onto the $y$-axis.

Okay, but how good is this bound? To understand how good this bound is, we can first consider dimensional analysis— a technique that is taught early on in 8.01 (Classical Mechanics) at MIT. The idea is the following: Suppose that we measured “volume” in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in square inches, i.e. $(\text{inches})^2$. If this were the case, then the shadows of $A$ onto the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis must be measured in inches. Therefore, looking at the above inequality (and replacing $A$ with its units and $\pi_x(A)$/$\pi_y(A)$ it their units), we get that \[(\text{inches}^2) \leq (\text{inches})\cdot (\text{inches}).\]

Given that we have inches squared on both sides, we might suspect that our inequality here is very good (for arbitrary finite sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$), and in fact it is! To see just how good out bound is, all we need is one example of a set $A$ where the inequality is an equality, and here is that example:

Take your set $A$ to be the set of integer lattice points, where each coordinate is an integer between $1$ and $N$ ($N$ here being some large number). Then, in total, we have that $|A| = N^2$ while $|\pi_x(A)| = |\pi_y(A)| = N$.

A good example to keep in mind that shows that the inequality we proved is in fact (sometimes) an equality). Can you find another such set that leads to an equality?

Hence, we have found a set where the inquality is an equality, and thus out bound is as good as one could’ve hoped for.

Exercise: Find an example of a set with roughly (up to some constant) $N$ points, whose projection onto the $x$- and $y$-axes has precisely $N$ points each. I.e., find an example of a set where the bound we got is really really bad.

Okay cool– that was a lot of math (and it is about to be quite a bit more in just a second), but let’s take a breath. What did we do? Well, essentially, we bounded the area of a set by the lengths of its shadows. And though this proof was fairly short, we might expect that the same thing holds in higher dimensions, which is in fact the case. In this post, the most we will do is study this in 3-dimensions, which we do now. The proof will be a little bit lengthy, but that is kinda the point of this blogpost (see Part 2).

Let $A$ be a finite set in $\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e. a bunch of points out in 3-dimensional space. Our goal is to (again) bound the number of points in $A$, i.e. $|A|$, by the number of points in its projections (i.e. projections onto the $xy$-, $yz$-, and $xz$-planes). Note: we denote these projections: $\pi_{xy}, \pi_{yz}$, and $\pi_{xz}$ respectively. More specifically, if it is helpful to see written down, we will have that \begin{align*} \pi_{xy}(x,y,z) &= (x,y) \\ \pi_{yz} (x,y,z) &= (y,z) \\. \pi_{xz}(x,y,z) &= (x,z).\end{align*}

Before we go into the proof of such a bound, let’s use dimensional analysis to figure out what this bound should look like. Namely speaking, we may expect to have a bound of the following form: \[|A| \leq (|\pi_{xy}(A)| \cdot |\pi_{yz}(A)|\cdot |\pi_{xz}(A)|)^{\alpha}\] for some constant $\alpha$.

Why might we expect this? Well, given our set $A$ is arbitrary, we should expect that no particular plane should be favored– i.e. there should be a symmetry to our bounds (as we have in the above formula). Secondly, and perhaps less rigorously– this bound looks the same as in the 2-dimensional case. So, for now, supposing that such a bound holds, let’s figure out what $\alpha$ should be by dimensional analysis. We measure $A$ in cubic inches and the projections (onto the 2-dimensional planes) in square inches. As such, we get that \[(\text{inches}^3) \leq [(\text{inches}^2)\cdot (\text{inches}^2)\cdot (\text{inches}^2)]^\alpha.\]

Hence, to get (at least through dimensional analysis) best bound we can hope for, we may expect $\alpha = 1/2$. In fact, this is the case:

Theorem: Let $A\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be a finite set of points. Then, \[|A| \leq \sqrt{|\pi_{xy}(A)|\cdot |\pi_{yz}(A)| \cdot |\pi_{xz}(A)|}.\]

We will spend the rest of Part 1 proving this fact, but to do so we will need some new and better ideas. Notice that, it is in fact true that \[A\subset [\pi_{xy}^{-1}(\pi_{xy}(A)) \cap \pi_{yz}^{-1}(\pi_{yz}(A)) \cap \pi_{xz}^{-1}(\pi_{xz}(A))],\] and thusly we automatically have that \[|A| \leq |\pi_{xy}(A)| \cdot |\pi_{yz}(A)| \cdot |\pi_{xz}(A)|,\] but this bound is worse than the one we are trying to obtain (and thusly we will need better ideas).

The “better” idea we will need will be to write $|A|$ as a sum. In particular, consider the function: $\mathbf{1}_A$, which is 1 on the set $A$ and is 0 otherwise. I.e., \[\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) = \begin{cases}1 & (x,y,z) \in A \\ 0 & (x,y,z) \notin A\end{cases}.\] This is known as an indicator function, and it is really helpful for our problem because we have that \[|A| = \sum_{x,y,z} \mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z).\] I.e., we have written $|A|$ as a sum that we can now manipulate.

Not only that, but we can similarly define indicator functions for all of the projections of $A$, namely $\mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xy}(A)}$, $\mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}$, and $\mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}$. What can we do with this? Well, we can notice that for all $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$, we have \[\mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \leq \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\]

Why is this true? Well, if $(x,y,z)$ is a point in $A$, then by definition $(x,y) \in \pi_{xy}(A)$, $(y,z) \in \pi_{yz}(A)$, and $(x,z) \in \pi_{xz}(A)$, so the left hand side (LHS) of the above inequality is 1 and so is the right hand side (RHS). Note: there may be points where the RHS is 1 but the LHS is 0– Why?? Similarly, if the RHS is zero, then one of the three terms in the product must be zero (say, $\mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)$). If this is the case, then it must be the case that $(x,y,z)$ is not a point of $A$ for any $z$! Therefore, when the RHS is zero, the LHS must be zero. This concludes the proof of the above inequality. Using it, we notice that we can use this in what we have proven thus far, namely: \[|A| = \sum_{x,y,z} \mathbf{1}_A(x,y,z) \leq \sum_{x,y,z} \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z).\]

At this point, I want to use something known as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. There are a bajillion (or rather, at least 12) proofs of this inequality (none of which are particularly long, but that I don’t want to write down into this blogpost). Basically, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that you can go from sums of products to products of sums (with certain exponents). In particular, we have that \begin{align*} &\sum_{x,y}\sum_z \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \\ &\leq \left(\sum_{x,y} \mathbf{1}^2_{\pi_{xy}(A)}(x,y)\right)^{1/2}\left(\sum_{x,y} \left(\sum_z \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\right)^2\right)^{1/2} := I \times II.\end{align*}

Why was this helpful? Because one can see immediately that $I = \sqrt{|\pi_{xy}(A)|}$! Note: Here, we used that $0^2 = 0$ and $1^2 =1$. So now we just need to bound the term $II$, or rather $II^2$ so we don’t have to carry the squareroot around everywhere. To do so, we can expand the sum in $z$ into a double sum in $z$ and another (dummy) variable $z’$.

In particular, we have that \begin{align*} II^2 &=\sum_{x,y} \left(\sum_z \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\right)^2 \\ &= \sum_{x,y}\sum_z \sum_{z’} \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z’). \end{align*} Try to see why the above bound is true! Using this, we have that \begin{align*} &\leq \sum_{x,z}\sum_{y,z’} \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\cdot \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’). \end{align*} Again, try to see why! Rearranging these sums (now that they are independent of one another), we see that \begin{align*} &= \sum_{x,z} \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{xz}(A)}(x,z)\cdot \sum_{y,z’}\mathbf{1}_{\pi_{yz}(A)}(y,z’)  \\ &= |\pi_{xz}(A)| \cdot |\pi_{yz}(A)|.\end{align*} Throwing back in the squareroot, we obtain the desired theorem.

Exercise: Prove that this bound is good by considering a similar example to the 2-dimensional case. Prove that this bound *can* be bad, i.e. that there is a set in which the inequality (while true) is WAAYYY overkill (for a more technical statement, see the analogous 2-dimensional exercise).

Exercise: Depending on your background in calculus, try proving a continuous version of this for “nice enough” sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. I.e., can you use integration (as opposed to discrete sums) to get rid of the assumption the $A$ is finite?

Exercise: Try generalizing this in higher dimensions! This is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality. The next difficult case to try perhaps is bounding the volume of a 4-dimensional finite set by the area of it’s projections onto (the 6!) 2-dimensional planes (i.e. the xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, zw-planes). If you find this interesting, consider looking into Alex Iosevich’s “A View From the Top” which is how I learned about this problem.

Part 2: The Lessons (aka the life part)

Part 2a: okay fine I’m not done talking about math yet– but give me a sec.

For those who skipped Part 1, the tldr of the math problem I was talking about was the following: Given some blob out in space, if you know how large it’s shadow is, can you know (roughly) how large the blob is? That’s is; that’s the problem (and it leads to what is known as the Loomis-Whitney inequality).

I first learned this proof (of the 3-dimensional) Loomis-Whitney inequality in the summer after my freshman year when I did a reading program with my (soon to be) research advisor Larry Guth and his graduate student Yuqiu Fu. Immediately, I fell in love with the problem (even if it was already solved by Loomis and Whitney all those years ago).

The reason I love this problem is two-fold. One: I love that this problem uses tools that I think are fundamentally interesting in how useful/simple they are (e.g., an inequality known as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, or using indicator functions). Two, and perhaps more fundamentally: I love that I can describe this problem in a single sentence: I want to understand some blob by knowing the shadows of the blob. Bam– that’s it.

And yet, when I look at the proof in all of it’s glory, I think to myself: this proof is ugly as hell. I mean sure! It works! It’s a complete proof! I can write it down completely from beginning to end. I can explain all the tiny steps that go into the overall proof. And I can admire it’s perfect and elegant use of simple inequalities. And yet. And yet.

I look at the proof and think: that was actually really hard to prove algebraically, especially given it was something I expected to be immediately clear.

—

People sometimes ask me how I got into the type of math that I do. And my response is always this story: In some classes, sometimes there is just something that irks me about a proof. I can write it down from start to finish. Examine all it’s details from beginning to end. And still, it feels too complicated. It seems to hard to be “the right way” to prove something. But alas it is. This is a feeling I have felt in many classes, especially at MIT.

Where sometimes, I would solve a homework problem in 18.701: Algebra I, look at it, and think “this must not be the simple way to prove this problem”. And most of the time I would be right. I’d turn to a friend who understood the subject better, and they’d give me a two-line, elegant solution. And then I’d stare at the solution and think to myself: well this seems to be hiding something behind the scenes. Like, there’s some magic that is happening that I don’t see in their two-line proof, and this (in turn) irks me more. Because in both cases, I don’t feel satisfied.

So imagine my surprise when I learn this proof in my reading course with Larry and Yuqiu, and I think to myself the same thing. But this time…. This time when I tell Larry that I think the proof feels too complicated for what we are proving– he says he agrees. That he too has thought about whether or not there is a simpler proof for this statement (and as far as I know hasn’t found one).

This was one of those few moments that really got me hooked into my area of mathematics: the fact that I could ask a question that I only barely knew how to put into words, and have it be something that others have been curious about before too.

Part 2b: okay fine some actual life stuff

I got into math for education. I mean, sure, I liked the subject myself, but part of what I liked most about mathematics was figuring out how to best explain/motivate a concept for other people (and thusly for myself too). This is why I ultimately decided that I wanted to become a professor.

And as a result, my freshman year I really felt this pressure in every class I took:

I’m struggling now so that one day I can explain these concepts to my students. Just work through it– you need to work through it to be a professor. Math is hard, but you just gotta get through this. Get through this. Get through this.

At first, education felt like my anchor point. Something to aim for and aspire to. But somewhere along the way, the anchor point became a bit difficult for me to hang onto in quite the same way. What was once “Work through this to become a good professor” became

Work through this to get into graduate school. You have to prove yourself to others. You have to prove yourself to you. Struggle through this. Struggle through this.

Now that I’ve gotten into graduate school– Now that I know where I will be for the next ~6 years of my life– Now that I am nearly ready to graduate from MIT–

—

As a mathematician, I look at the proof of the Loomis-Whitney inequality and think to myself: this is beautiful. As an educator, I’m conflicted. I mean sure– I can motivate why I like the proof as a mathematician, but I couldn’t explain the proof to someone on a walk. And because (for me) mathematics has always been deeply intertwined with education, that bothers me.

But what bothers me more than that, is that for the past couple of years at MIT I’ve felt like I’ve ignored why that bothers me. I’ve ignored the part of me that wants to think about how I present mathematics in a more accessible way (e.g., this blog). I don’t know. Perhaps that isn’t fully coherent.

All of which is to say, I am excited to stop ignoring that irksome feeling in graduate school. Because I made it. In Fall 2025, I will be returning to MIT to pursue my PhD in mathematics.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-400x298.jpg

I felt profoundly small. The world was changing right before my eyes and there was nothing I could do about it. At first, it felt like nothing was happening but, then, the entire landscape transformed. 

The moment was ephemeral. For totality, the difference between 99% and 100% felt far beyond between 0% and 99%. My eyes began to well, and I couldn’t have prepared myself for the stir of emotions that suddenly flooded me: awe, joy, confusion, denial, and horror. The world shifted for a moment and, slowly but surely, it faded back into what was, as if nothing had happened.

I thought about the rise and fall of the sun. Every day, we have a peaceful dawn and an idyllic sundown, yet they seem to mostly exist in the background of our lives. If sunrises and sunsets occurred more rarely, perhaps we would take a longer look at them. Scarcity breeds demand or whatever. 

In that same vein, if total eclipses occurred daily, would my friends and I have woken up at 4:00 am to drive for 4 hours to the tippity top of Vermont and 10 hours back to arrive back home on a school night at 3:00 am the following day?

I planned most of the trip in our Notion page. Here’s the first part of it:



Also made a fitting playlist:

We had a good crew. I planned the trip. Daina N. ‘25 drove mostly in the city and is an 
        EAPS major,
      
a.k.a. big Earth nerd. Isaac L. ‘25 drove mostly out of the city and is an astrophotographer. Caitlin O. ‘25 was our backup-turned-main driver. Oris S. N. ‘23 is a massive astrophysics nerd in every way and detailed our adventure in an email he sent out to some friends. I forwarded that email over to some of my friends. Here are some excerpts:

we did it :)

also, i find it cute that the last two trips i went on match up with lyrics from You’re So Vain by Carly Simon (excellent cheeky fun song):

Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia

Subject: Re: Eclipse of April 8th, 2024

To: oris_pals

Hi all,

Yesterday, as everyone probably is aware, was a Solar Eclipse day. […]

Here is my adventure:

creatures of dawn

     […] We had originally planned to go to St Albans City in Vermont but, early on the way we then decided to go to Newport, VT, given some discouraging changes in St Albans weather forecast. We arrived at Newport at ~8:30am, so we had hours and hours of spare time before the Eclipse started. Yay!

viewing location

Kano and Daina […] found a small lakeshore beach, the Prouty Beach at Boston Park (yes we went from Boston to Boston haha), that had an spectacularly unobstructed view of the sky.



[…] After setting my equipment there and testing polar alignment and sun photos, Kano[, Caitlin, and I] went for a stroll in the town. Newport is a lovely town and it was definitely not made to have as many people as it had yesterday lol. […]

first contact

At 2:16pm EST, April 8th 2024, the spectacle started. 

[…] The totality was predicted for 15:27:07 of where we were. I had my laptop open, monitoring Stellarium the whole time so I could keep track of coverage levels. Every 10 mins I would take a photo of the Sun:



After I got that last photo, I had a plan: I’d wait for the totality start, fully experiencing that with no distractions of cameras or telescope, and I’d let myself be on that state for 30s in totality, when then I’d snap back to take a photo of it and once I was satisfied, go back to the experiencing it with no distractions so I could see it end.

[…] Now, I’m not proud of it, but I did glance at the Sun without my glasses a few times (please NEVER do that, I was being stupid). […] Some takeaways from these small experiences:

- DON’T DO IT it is dangerous…

- You can’t see anything interesting at all for most of the time. […]

- At about 85% coverage I took a glance and once again did not see anything interesting tho the after shadow of the Sun in my retina […] was crescent shape! 

[…] We waited… We noticed that the environment was getting colder […] It was also noticeable that it was getting darker […] When I noticed that it was at about 93%, I bumped my friends to look around and feel the moment: that was what Boston was experiencing, and that was the max of what it would experience. […]

We were approaching Totality. […]

95%

Nothing.

97%

Nothing.

98%

Nothing.

Then, the last 20 seconds all happened at once.

[…] The Sun went from glaring to dark in a second, with the last glimpse of the Sun’s incredible brightness disappearing in a shinny dot of light in the edge of the disk of the Eclipse. […] If I […] wasn’t aware an Eclipse was happening, I would only notice something at the last 10-20 seconds. 

I understand why Solar Eclipses were regarded as mystical events for most of the history of humanity. […] Nothing can prepare someone to one of these. […] The sky was in a mix of night time with dawn and sunrise, but all directions of the horizon glowed. […] It was crisp, and it was impossible. 

[…] Finally, with the Eclipse, I had a sensation that I very rarely had in my life. At times, when in a place where I was under a beautiful night sky, I could focus very hard on one thing and wait for a good 10-20-30 mins and notice that it has moved through the sky. In general, Celestial Objects move/change too slow for humans to dynamically notice. That is not the case in the Eclipse: in the moments surrounding second and third contacts you can see the brightness of the Sun suddenly changing. […]

Here are some photos of that moment, as well as a video.





[…] Well, yeah I had an 
        Astrophotography setup
      
 for the Eclipse. […] Isaac’s setup was a bit 
        more professional
      
.

[…] Here are other things worth mentioning from yesterday:

- […] We were so lucky with the whole location thing. The lakeshore beach was gorgeous.

- […] I had a quintessential American experience yesterday: I had my first Lunchables. It was good! Or at least as good as it could be.

The end

That is all (I think?) […] Here’s a selfie of the crew of yesterday’s adventure.



Sincerely,  

Oris

Also, here’s the product of Isaac’s work:



Allison ’27

When I was applying to colleges a year and a half ago, there were a lot of good reasons that I was excited about colleges in Boston, and one silly one: the 2024 solar eclipse would pass just north of the city. Four hours north, in fact. +1 pt. for MIT.

And then I got in! A sign, perhaps, that I had to see it. So I made plans to tag along with a group of friends in 
        ESP
      
 to drive up to Vermont the day of the eclipse. We found just enough people to drive, and rented cars, and planned an itinerary, and raided Trader Joe’s for road trip snacks. There were three cars’ worth of people—for my sanity in explaining all this, let’s anthropomorphize them as Carter, Caroline, and Carina. 

Then, at 9 pm the night before April 8, the trials began:

Carina’s driver had fallen sick, and couldn’t make the trip the next morning. This was unfortunate (especially for our driver, who was now both sick and unable to see the eclipse 😭), but after some deliberation, we decided to rent out a twelve-seater van (let’s name him Vance), and Carter’s driver would drive both the passengers of both Carina and Carter to Vermont.

Very early in the morning, Carter’s driver and a valiant assistant embarked on their journey to the mystical land known as “the car rental place.” There they waited in line for our van. They waited. And they waited. And they waited some more, all for the poor, singular employee on the 
        morning of the eclipse
      
 to process a massive line of people impatient to set out before traffic. When the rest of our crew arrived at our designated pickup location (outside the Student Center) at 8:15 am sharp, they were still waiting.

By the time the clock hit 9:00, we were worried, but luckily we’d found another driver! We therefore no longer really needed Vance, but unfortunately our attempts at getting access to Caroline fell through. In the wise words of one of our intrepid explorers, 
        Fiona L. ‘27,
      
 “everything that can go wrong, will go wrong,” so we decided to rent yet another new car (Carlos) to make sure we could leave on time. In the meantime, Carter’s driver stuck it out in the original Vance line just a bit longer.

When they finally got to the front of the line, however, the car rental place had no 12-seaters. In fact, they had no cars at all for us, despite our reservation. Luckily, we were prepared—“everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” Our two drivers met to pick up Carlos, and began driving back to campus for the rest of us.

And then CARTER GOT A FLAT TIRE. I kid you not. At 9:42 am, Carter got a flat tire, and we were basically screwed. The Carter/Carlos crew worked quickly to switch to a spare, but they had to visit a repair shop before the four hour drive to Vermont. And then the first repair shop said they couldn’t fix it, so the crew had to move to a second. {Before I sent this blog to our group, I thought this shop was the one that fixed it. I have since been informed that it was not this one. Nor was it the third shop. It was, in fact, the fourth shop that could fix the tire 😭} They did the job relatively quickly, but by the time both cars made it back to campus to pick everyone up, it was 11:15 am. We had originally planned to leave at 8:15. 

“Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.”

But wait, there’s more! Totality would arrive in Vermont around 3:30 pm. Without traffic, the shortest drive to the path (headed to St. Johnsbury, VT) would be ~3 hours without any traffic. And it being the last total solar eclipse in the continental US for the next 20 years meant traffic. We weren’t sure if we could make it, but luckily traffic didn’t seem bad (except in a couple spots). We were staying on schedule. Life was looking good!

Then I threw up… It was in a plastic bag, thank goodness, but um… that was not a fun experience, and it also meant we had to make a pit stop that delayed us even more. Sorry to Carlos and all his other passengers 😬.

Despite this setback, however, we soldiered on. And somehow, miracle of miracles, we made it into the path of totality with 15 minutes to spare. We found the first available place to park, piled out of Carlos, and looked up at the sky (with eclipse glasses, of course). The color slowly leached out of our surroundings, the air got cooler, and then the sky went dark. Totality.

I won’t put my pictures here, mainly because they literally just show a blob, but it was incredible. I learned about solar eclipses back in 8th grade, and we were told about these two phenomena—Baily’s Beads, where the sun shines through dips in the moon’s uneven surface to make little dots of sunlight, and the red light of the sun’s chromosphere, which is only visible during eclipses. Here’s a 2017 photo from the European Space Agency of what this look like up close, if you’re curious:



I’d heard about them so many times, but I never thought they’d be visible from the naked eye—only from long exposures with professional cameras. And yet, looking up, there they were! Little dots of light and a distinct reddish outline around the edge of the sun.

Our view of totality was very brief (about 30 seconds, because we barely made it into the path of totality), but it was fascinating nonetheless.  Even more than that, though, I really loved the reactions of everyone around us watching the eclipse together. We shared eclipse glasses in the lead-up, and you could hear the murmurs crescendo into shouts and clapping as totality fell. The shared energy of humans witnessing something exciting and otherworldly was honestly just as amazing as the eclipse itself.

After seeing totality, we drove north to actually reach St. Johnsbury, and waited 35 minutes for a grocery store bathroom (bless them for having it open to the public). We started heading back to MIT around 5:00 pm, and after a couple shortcuts(?), we made it back at 10:30 pm. Not nearly as long as those who’d gone up to Newport (much further north and w/ more totality), but still quite long.

Was the trip a bit of a hot mess? Comedically so. Was it worth it? Definitely. I may have fallen behind on schoolwork (carsickness kept me from doing anything en route), and almost everything that could go wrong might’ve gone wrong, but we saw the eclipse! Besides, in the words of one of my favorite bands, AJR, “A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories.” And this was one of the better ones!

B1 planned a trip that spanned three cars, eighteen people, and an egregious number of hours inching forward through traffic. We set out at 9am — we had plans for eight, but the line in front of Budget Rental Cars was far too long. I piled into a car of seniors: Gosha, Selena, Masha (Gosha’s friend), and Claire, the only other driver, who did so far more calmly than I did.

The first three hours of driving went fine — or at least I think they did; I was asleep in the back seat. I took over around hour two. We kept passing speed traps. But as we neared New Hampshire, or Vermont, traffic slowed to a crawl. A literal crawl. For about three hours, it probably would have been faster to get out and walk. 

We’d planned to arrive at the path of totality around 2:30pm, one hour before the 1-3 minutes of totality. But traffic pushed that back. By 2:30, we were still 40 miles away and moving about 5 miles per hour. We discussed, and decided we’d pull over at 3:20, wherever we were. We didn’t expect to be where we wanted by totality.

The eclipse started at 2:30, but the light didn’t change and the traffic didn’t slow until 3. When the light shifted, people started giving up on making the path of totality and pulled off to the side. All down the highway, cars pulled to the shoulder. People poured out and climbed on the hill. 

And then the highway was empty.

I floored it. 

We raced through a light that was grey, different enough to notice, but subtle enough that on any other day I’d attribute it to an unfamiliar alignment of New England clouds, or simply to too much caffeine, and too little sleep. I pushed faster and faster. I felt the shift of gravity as we careened around curves, and the rush as I realized that one mistake would obliterate us. A few other cars were using me as coverage for speed traps and I let them pass, gave them enough distance that the highway was empty, just us and the dotted white lines blurring past.

The light faded and everyone was waiting and I was making so many decisions, my foot on the gas, hurtling onward. I thought that even if we missed the totality this was how I wanted to experience the eclipse, driving so fast on empty roads.

We pulled onto a side road at 3:26 and parked in a line of eclipse-viewers. The light was grey but unmistakeably day time. We approached the car next to us and asked, “Are we in totality? And do you have extra glasses?”

“Yes, and yes,” answered a man in his mid-twenties, with close-cut brownish hair and a patterned button-down, the quintessential Bostonian professional. He gave us extra glasses; we’d left ours in one of the other B1 cars. “I drove five hours to be right here. It better be right.”

We stepped away and disappeared into our glasses. Through them, the sun barely peeked out from behind the moon.

Then the moon moved up, and the sun was just a corona.

The eclipse itself was magical.

It was light at first in totality, then dark, like night falling all at once. It looked like true night. It was cold, and the sun behind the moon was beautiful. I understood how one could look at this and say that they had stronger gods. 

There was dead quiet on the highway, except for one car rushing back the way we’d come. He has no wonder, we said. The quiet enhanced the magic, as if the whole world stopped for this.

And then it was ending. The sun peeked out, and the dim light returned. The shadows in the crags of the rocks were so deep. For the next hour I kept looking at the landscape, trying to judge, between the adrenaline in my body and my headache and the eclipse, how real the light was, how smoky or grey. 

I’m glad I saw the eclipse. I’m glad we did. That was insane all of it.

how strange it is to be anything at all

I had lots of dreams as a kid. In particular, I had a bunch of pretty outlandish ones, like getting absurdly rich by starting a company, time travel to the year 3000, live to see myself graduate high school, and also, see a total solar eclipse. The internet told me, however, that the last dream was futile: the next eclipse—well, the next eclipse in the US at least, I didn’t really think about anywhere else—was hundreds of miles away from where I grew up. So, the eclipse dream got shelved like the others, and I became a worldly, serious woman without such silly aspirations.

My kid self didn’t realize that by the year 2024 I would be in college and mostly have the ability to go wherever I wanted. The other thing I didn’t know was that, by pure coincidence, my family would have moved across the country to Rochester, NY—which happens to be located within that tiny sliver of totality.

So, four of my friends and I crashed at my house for the weekend. We got wet on the Maid of the Mist under Niagara Falls, watched Poor Things in my living room (that one might’ve been a mistake), and we also got to see the rarest of astronomical events: the total solar eclipse, located at a sweet 12-minute walk from my house.

 

Here is my favorite eclipse fact: most of the eclipses that will ever happen are in the past. When the moon first formed, back when the earth was young and hot and hellish, it was three times as close as it is now. It looked about three times as big as it does today. Eclipses were probably… around nine times more frequent? Over the billions of years since, the moon has slowly come to its position today, as each year the moon moves an inch and a half away.

And within the next billion years, the moon will be so small that it can no longer cover the sun at all. That will be the last eclipse; we are nearly almost there. The margin is so small now that the moon is sometimes bigger than the sun, and sometimes smaller, depending on where it is in its orbit. It is coincidence beyond coincidence that there are even eclipses at all.

And also, within the next billion years, macroscopic life on Earth will end. The sun will grow ten percent brighter; the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will decrease, killing the plants and presumably all the animals with them. Then the surface temperature will rise to over a hundred degrees, cooking everything in existence.

And so, most life on Earth that will ever live has probably already lived. To start with, though, life too was a coincidence beyond coincidence. The complexity of even the humblest cell is tremendous. And the fact that those single cells came together to think, to realize itself, to discover itself: that seems even less believable.

Some think that the moon was responsible for us: that the flow and ebb, the push and pull of those early tide pools was the cradle of first life. And so maybe there is a deeper link between these two coincidences. Or maybe there isn’t; trying to predict what happened millions of years ago or what will happen millions of years from now is maybe no more than just science men’s tea-leaf reading.

 

Those were the things I was thinking about, while we were sprawled out on the lawn, waiting for the eclipse to happen. Well, there ended up being just one more coincidence: the clouds were in perfect position to block out the sky completely during the eclipse. Our hard-won eclipse glasses were useless. We grumbled under the overcast sky. 

Other than an increasing chill, no change was visible at all until maybe five minutes before the eclipse. Then the sky seemed to grow a few shades darker every minute; nothing happened for a few seconds, I looked away, I looked back, the sky was darker again, and then suddenly the sky darkened completely, like God had finished playing with us and finally flipped his light switch. Thanks to the clouds, no sun was visible; no corona; no Baily’s beads; but the sky was a dark turquoise, the clouds glowed a vomit orange. Streetlamps turned on; dogs barked. It felt unnatural and eerie, like the earth had gotten terribly sick. 

And as soon as it happened, it was over. The sky began to pale, and soon enough, it was overcast again, as if nothing had happened. I’d taken my coat off to feel the authentic chill of the eclipse; I put it back on. And on the walk back, I told my mom that this all meant we were fated to see another eclipse in the rest of our short lives—one where the sky was clear, where not a single cloud would be in the sky, and everything worked out just the way it was meant to be.

the real eclipse was the friends we made along the way 

I chased totality with friends from my living group/frat t𝜩p. We left Boston the day before to camp out in the Green Mountains in northern Vermont. As the designated “food car,” getting everything — a lot of food, a mini grill, camping equipment, personal bags, — was a game of Tetris. Grace drove, and Winnie navigated. Ilani, Terrin, and I got to turn off our brains as the backseat crew. But, I would like to think that we pulled our weight by hugging all the stuff that couldn’t fit in the trunk. 

like no leg room whatsoever

After five hours of losing feeling in my butt and being neck deep in stuff (which I would honestly still prefer over driving), we found a place to camp right before sunset. Grace explained that we were dispersive camping, which is when you camp outside an actual campground and therefore don’t need to pay fees. 

A thin layer of snow blanketed the ground, twinkling slightly in the fading light of the day. It was beautiful until we realized that it made keeping dry (and by extension, not getting hypothermia) harder. 



One could say that we were unprepared for dispersive camping in the snow, but one could also say that we were resourceful. Using the mini grill’s lid as a shovel, we cleared out two rectangles of snow to pitch our tents. We remembered to bring charcoal briquettes for the grill, but not lighter fluid. Winnie came in clutch with the bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol that she usually keeps in her backpack for cleaning circuit boards, which surprisingly got the grill going strong enough to grill a whole fish. 

By then, night had fallen. We realized in the pitch black darkness that we had two headlamps for five people. But that was enough light to see that our fish was (mostly) cooked through. We dug in.  

“Woah what’s the goopy stuff?” “Guts.” “Oof it tastes good.” 

“Woah what’s the goopy stuff?”

“Guts.”

“Oof it tastes good.” 

Isn’t it wild that an ungutted fish would come with guts? It helped that Ilani thought that the fish guts had the most flavor, such that we ate pretty much every part of the fish save for the bones. Sharing a whole fish was a very familial ritual for me, as my mom would pick out the bit under the cheek as the most tender part of the fish for me to enjoy. This time, I got to be the one to pick out the cheek bit for others. 



I have only been able to gaze at a night sky untouched by light pollution a few times in my life. When we turned off our headlamps, it felt as if we were enveloped by an infinite black cloak. The temperature had dropped below freezing, but I forgot about that just for a bit. The woods, the mountains, and the sky melted into one endless expanse. Once my eyes adjusted, I still could only barely make out the silhouettes of trees faintly illuminated by starlight. 

I knew the Big Dipper and Orion, and then Grace pointed out the Little Dipper so I guess I now know that one too. 

the big dipper :)

I thought it was a firefly at first, by the way its glow darted from one corner of the sky to another. Then I realized, it was a shooting star!! I’ve seen them once before in the White Mountains a few summers ago, and I just saw my second one in the Green Mountains. Sometimes I forget that shooting stars are real. Meteors are just like the rest of us, in a hurry to get from one place to another. I’m just glad that amongst all of the possible trajectories it could’ve taken through space, it crossed mine for a brief moment. 

✨✨✨

We woke up bright and early to stuff in another hot meal, courtesy of Winnie’s grillmaster skills, and to hit the roads for Peru, a rural town in upstate New York that happened to be in the dead center of the totality path. A t𝜩p alum’s uncle owns a farmhouse there and kindly let several groups of t𝜩p alumni come over for eclipse festivities. I loved telling people that I was chasing totality in Peru without mentioning the upstate New York part. 

There should’ve been two more cars of undergrad t𝜩ps to meet up with us at Peru. But noooo, they decided that the forecasted 40% cloud cover in upstate NY was too high for them and veered off towards northern Vermont instead. (Did they not consider that they just ditched the food car??) Our car talked it over, ultimately deciding that hanging out with alumni was a big part of this trip and forging ahead with what we had planned. 

Farmhouse in Peru, NY

We frolicked in the farmland, caught the alums up with current t𝜩p matters, grilled potatoes, and accidentally burned potatoes down to charcoal. Someone had a fancy telescope setup whose resolution allowed you to see sunspots freckling the brilliant orange surface of the sun. I borrowed glasses to peer at the shrinking sliver of sun once in a while. But really I was most happy to be touching grass out in the middle of nowhere and taking in the warmth of the sun after sleeping outside in below freezing conditions…

Until it suddenly got chilly. The birds must’ve felt it too, taking flight in all directions. 

When the sun slipped behind the moon, a collective woah fell across the group. I felt many of the same things as I did the night before gazing at the stars. But at this moment, when the sky quickly fell into a velvety shade of dark cobalt, I was also reminded of one of my favorite novel scenes: 

“It’s just incredible. I can’t believe you’ve given me the sky to sleep under. But I can’t tell if it’s dawn or dusk you’ve painted.” She smiled up at the ceiling. “It’s neither. It’s both. Does that unnerve you?” from Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg

“It’s just incredible. I can’t believe you’ve given me the sky to sleep under. But I can’t tell if it’s dawn or dusk you’ve painted.”

She smiled up at the ceiling. “It’s neither. It’s both. Does that unnerve you?”

from Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg

It was dusk. It was dawn. It was neither, it was both in the most beautiful of ways. We were simultaneously nothing compared to the celestial bodies that just aligned and and 
        in that moment I swear we were infinite.
      
 I’m not sure if I’ve already written about this here, but I find the insignificance of my being to be more comforting than unnerving, as it means I can create significance in whatever way I choose. I tried to think about what this eclipse meant in terms of higher beings and such, but at the end of the day, the fact that I could witness all this alongside my friends bore the most significance to me. 

Also cloud cover had nothing on us. :)

We packed up the car as soon as dusk-dawn gave way to day. The birds went on their merry way and so did we. Rural upstate New York wasn’t too bad in terms of traffic, but we immediately hit a standstill upon crossing the border to Vermont. There was a bar/inn/convenience store (I’m not sure which one) on the side of the highway, whose owner took us gridlocked townies as a business opportunity. 

“VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP!!!! JUST [X] DOLLARS A GALLON!!!!”

“SORRY NEXT TIME!!!” we yelled back through our windows. 

Inching through traffic allowed us to take in the local scenery, which often included cows.

What did the cow say to the eclipse traffic? MOOOOOOOOOVE

What did the cow say to the eclipse traffic? MOOOOOOOOOVE

It was quite obvious that the trip back would take way longer than the 5 hours it took to get there, but the question became how long. Google maps claimed there to be no traffic on the main highway we were crawling through, but the unending centipede of taillights stretching before us begged to differ. Right… there was no cell service in the middle of the Green Mountains, and Google maps pulls traffic data from people’s cell phones.

Grace called her mom for advice on how to avoid crawling through the next 200 miles in gridlock. We could keep following Google maps, but that’s what most people are going to do. It’s worth at least checking out the back roads if they’re any better, and lo and behold they were! Again Grace pulled through with the insane driving stamina, Winnie with the navigation, and Terrin, Ilani and I with the backseat cheer crew. The drive back took 7-8 hours including rest stops, which was considered speedy compared to what I’ve heard. 

☀️☀️☀️

That was a lot. I gazed at the stars, I witnessed the flight of a meteor, and I beheld the alignment of the moon and the sun against the most brilliant of dusk-dawns. I am so so glad to have chased totality, and so so thankful for the people who I went with.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kanonotion.png

what’s the point?,"Alan Z. '23, MEng '24",11,2024-04-21T00:00:00-04:00,"part 1: impact

One of my strongest core beliefs is that the answer to the question “what is the meaning of life?” is not “to change the world,” at least in the way that phrase is typically meant. I think it is very easy to be sold that story, especially at MIT—to be told that your job, your mission, is to solve the world’s great challenges, and that nothing else will suffice, nothing else will make your life meaningful. And, it’s admirable, in a way, to declare this the meaning of life. The world faces many, many great challenges that must be solved, and, surely, it must be our job to fix them.

The problem with this framing, I think, is that it makes the “everything else” of our lives mundane and unimportant, in a way that I just don’t believe. If you think about it for a few more moments, the chance that you or any other person will ever have a major, measurable impact on the world is slim to none, but each of us must have a reason to continue living. It may not be true that life itself has a meaning—but we must all have our own meanings to keep going.

And, in truth, I do think there is a meaning of life. I wrote three years ago, back in sophomore spring, that for me the meaning of life, in essence, is other people—in the communities we make and the relationships we have, the support we receive from other people and the support we give. I think this because it is the one thing in this world which makes me feel most human, that we interact with one another to
        make our lives better as a collective.
      
Deep down, I’ve believed this even since high school, where I wrote that “to be little, positive parts of other people’s stories is perhaps the best we can hope to be, as we ourselves travel through life.”

One other reason that I dislike the idea that one’s mission is to “change the world” is that it fails to present a comprehensive
        theory of change.
      
 When we say we want something to change, the natural question in my mind is always “how?” When people say, “here’s something I’m mad about and here’s what I’m going to do,” I’m always thinking, “and then what?” How do we get from a point where you do something to a point where the thing you want changed is actually concretely better?

This has always been a pet peeve of mine, and, at this point, probably something I’m overly sensitive to, having spent a number of years in various student government positions here. People love saying “this is bad” without really having any idea about how to change it, or going to administrators without doing any kind of proactive work to build relationships and collaborate in a way that actually creates positive progress. And, although I, too, understand the cathartic effects of griping and the legitimacy of many frustrations, I can’t help but think that the ultimate focus needs to be on actions which will, ultimately, drive a specific, positive impact.

The “change the world” approach, to me, feels like one of these problematic cases—a mission statement without any sort of theory of change. This may seem like a strawman argument to you, but I do genuinely think there are lots of people who view their mission in life as “changing the world” without any regard as to the “how, specifically?” It’s the same reason that people in Silicon Valley keep trying to found new things rather than improving existing ones. In contrast, the intent to keep making other people’s lives better at a micro-local level, at least to me, presents a coherent theory of change—when we do kind things, other people become more likely to pay it forward, and
        slowly, but surely, things get better.
      


So, that’s what I think. You don’t have to change the world. If you set that as your goal, your one true mission statement, you will more likely end up sad than anything else. But, if you aim at being, on net, a positive influence on the people around you, things might just work out.

part 2: art

One thing I’m very grateful to MIT for is that it has really allowed me to explore the limits of what I can do, in ways that I never quite imagined. I’ve picked up skills I didn’t think I’d ever learn; last year, in the playwright’s note for a play I wrote called Remembering Her, I put:

It is also a play about imagination. Inside and outside the theater, I want you to imagine boldly who you could be. For the prefrosh among us, MIT is a place where you have the opportunity to challenge yourself to do things you never thought possible. Dream big. If you’d told me four years ago that I’d be involved in student government, or conducting a pit orchestra, or writing a show for people to see, I’d have told you that you were mad. But here we are. When you find yourself stuck, imagine a different world, and then find a way to get there. You may find that it is easier than you think.

When you find yourself stuck, imagine a different world, and then find a way to get there. You may find that it is easier than you think.

Let’s talk about that play. I wrote it in three days as an emergency back-up for
        Next Act
      
2023, for reasons that I don’t really want to get into right now. I honestly don’t really remember how I wrote it—I just know I spent a lot of time at my laptop, basically talking to myself, imagining these characters talking to each other, until suddenly there were fifty pages of script in front of me, ready to be rehearsed and revised as necessary.

I really struggled during the rehearsal process for the show. I was constantly anxious, between the feeling of having my words read back to me and just the knowledge that I didn’t have a lot of time, if any, to revise anything that felt off. Every once in a while, I would begin to feel hopeful, like the play just might work, only to have it come crashing back down on me a couple of days later—up and down and up and down. I wanted to get off the train.


        Tech week
      
and shows were like a fever dream. Suddenly, we had a stage and lights and chairs and
        a steering wheel
      
and a pit, and then an audience, and then suddenly it was all over. And, even during shows, my rollercoaster of emotions continued. Every audience was different, responding to different parts of the story night to night; they clapped for
        different scenes,
      
laughed and “aw”ed at different moment. One day, I’d talk to a friend in more depth about the things I cared about the most in the story, the depiction of two different kinds of families or the mix between comedy and drama, and I’d feel happy about achieving my goals; the next day, I’d wake up and feel listless and hopeless again. After the second show, I wrote in my journal:

I am gaining confidence that the script is a good one, but I am increasingly faced with the fact that it is a musical that is not really a musical, and a play that is not really a play, and, apart from this brief moment in which it is producible, I am not sure exactly what value it brings—

I am gaining confidence that the script is a good one, but I am increasingly faced with the fact that it is a musical that is not really a musical, and a play that is not really a play, and, apart from this brief moment in which it is producible, I am not sure exactly what value it brings—

And, there it is, that funny word. Value. I think the fundamental question, the question which I still haven’t really resolved, is “was it good enough?” It’s the reason I haven’t written about the show until now, a whole year later. I don’t know if it was good enough. Sure, it was well-received, certainly by my friends, and in general, by the audiences that saw it, but it also received so much additional effort above the text. The show had great actors, great lighting designers, great directors, great musicians; it was not my work on stage, but my work modulated and focused by the people around me.

When I’m on this train of thought, I often think about
        Elizabeth Bishop’s
      
words about creative writing classes. In describing the comparative prevalence of students interested in writing courses, rather than English or literature courses, she once said:

It’s true, children sometimes write wonderful things, paint wonderful pictures, but I think they should be discouraged.

It’s true, children sometimes write wonderful things, paint wonderful pictures, but I think they should be discouraged.

The thought is there: maybe I’m not good enough. Maybe I haven’t read enough of the classics, or even the moderns; maybe I don’t yet know or enough to produce great art, or maybe I’m just not built to produce it.

I’ve found it very hard to write these past few months. I feel like nothing I write will ever really be good enough; it will never have true, artistic merit, or, at the very least, it will not have the impact I want it to have on readers. I want my words to be able to reach out from the page, grab the reader, and spin them around until they see the world my way, at least for a moment, to make them truly, deeply feel something. I want my writing to have meaning, for it to be edifying, to make people feel like they’ve gotten something out of each and every sentence. But, language is imprecise, and I don’t know if I will ever achieve that in the way I truly, deeply want to.

I can feel this question—“was it good enough?” or “what’s the point?”—starting to creep outwards into my life. There are places where the point is clear, or, at the very least, it seems plausible that the things I’m doing have positive societal value. I still love teaching; I still love working on computer systems, however nerdy that pursuit is. It is really in the art where the questions sit at the forefront of my mind. Why conduct? Why sing? Why write? I don’t have any answers beyond this primal desire to do so, this feeling that when I’m conducting or when I’m writing, I’m losing myself in the music and the text, but, the question recurs: why do art when I might not ever be good enough to do it professionally, when I might not ever be able to do anything world-changing?

part 3: reconciliation

It is very hard to reconcile these two worlds of thoughts—this feeling that the idea of impact is overrated, and this overwhelming feeling that the art I make must have artistic value. Everything about art feels so fleeting and vulnerable that the importance of impact is magnified; after all, the relationship between a person and your art is always transitory. The moment of interaction is always brief, fleeting, and uncertain; a show happens, a poem is written and read, and then it is on to the next thing. How can I make something that lasts or that matters within that context?

In this sense, one of the only things that grounds me is, strangely enough, external validation.

I often feel uncertain about my relationship with external validation. It seems that for one’s happiness to be truly, deeply
        complete,
      
it must be lasting, and external validation is anything but. Yet, it is the thing that most often reminds me that I am achieving my goals, in whatever little ways I can. It reminds me that my art is doing the thing, that when people respond to my work, when they say they “feel seen,” it is becoming a small, positive part of someone else’s life, and that I can release it into the wild.

In other words, it provides me a theory of change.

I’ve often thought of writing as this kind of deeply lonely task. You sit at your desk, or, in my case, on my bed or on a couch, somewhere, and you type away until you either have a product or you give up. Your writing is founded on observation, sure, but that observation process, I think, is also more often conducted alone, in the solitary moments you have, passing through the world rather than living fully in it. I feel this way about music, too, sometimes. You practice and you learn your music on your own, and then you show up at rehearsal just to put it all together, and, yes, there’s a back and forth, but, ultimately, the practice of it, the individualness of it, feels solitary.

You might say, and you would be right, that the writing is just one part of the story. A theatre production—especially one like Next Act,
        where the whole goal of the project is accepting everyone
      
and building community—involves so many people working together in ways that are hard to express, and that, too, is an opportunity to make other people’s lives better, to be a kind collaborator and to work together to make something beautiful. And, similarly, I am grateful for all the feedback I’ve gotten over the years, in poetry workshops and orchestra rehearsals, and for all the work people have invested in things for me, from pit musicians to
        first readers
      
to actors to everyone else in between, which has made my life and my work better in countless ways.

But, in the moment, when you are working away on a project on your own, it is very easy to forget. It is easy to feel like the audience is the void. That nothing is ever going to respond to your work, to these collections of glyphs on a screen or to the music you are making. And when the audience is the void, it is easy to forget why you should be making art in the first place.

Since childhood, I’ve been a big fan of keeping memorabilia. I have so many different objects, from brochures to maps to countless programs from all the shows and concerts I’ve seen or been involved in. I’d like to think I have a pretty good memory, but the concrete objects remind me of the things I’ve done and the places I’ve been in a way that feels more visceral and important.

One of my special collections lives outside of my
        memorabilia crate,
      
residing instead in the top-most drawer in my desk. It’s a collection of every hand-written thank you note and birthday card and everything else I’ve ever received. Whenever I get a kind email, a note, I file it away for moments where I feel like I am treading water in the void. I read them to remind me that my art and my life have a purpose, and that, as I work, I am still making steps towards achieving it. That the little actions we take each day to make each other’s lives better do matter.

And so it is these kinds of moments which kept me going through and after Next Act. I’ve written before that I believe one of the highest compliments that an artist can receive is “this made me cry”; when the things we make can evoke an emotion strong enough in someone else to make them cry. After the first performance, my
        Head of House,
      
who’d been a part of my time at Next House all four years, told me that it made him cry. Another friend told me it was the first time he’d seen a non-conventional family represented so movingly on stage. It worked. I had added something positive to their lives, however small and transitory.

Even still, you forget. It’s so hard to remember the joy and the purpose of making art—every time I put down the pen, it takes me so much more energy to pick it back up again, because I just worry and worry and worry, that it won’t be good enough, rather than thinking about the small, positive differences I could make. I’ve been working on a play again this semester, and it is has been so much harder to write than anything I’ve written before. The expectations and the stakes feel higher, in a way that makes it hard to keep making forward progress, rather than just throwing one’s arms up and giving up.

I came back to Next Act this year, this time in a much smaller role: I helped vocal direct and then played
        percussion
      
in the pit orchestra. The show was Legally Blonde, which is one of my favorite musicals, and our conductor was one of my good friends, who lives on
        4W
      
and played in the pit for Heathers, my very first conducting gig, just over a year ago. I enjoyed feeling like I was serving a purpose—imparting the wisdom which I’ve sopped up from years of choir in the first role, and then just making a bunch of noises
        at the right time
      
in the second one.

At the second show, during intermission, somebody came up to me and thanked me for Remembering Her. They said that it’d helped them cope with their friend’s passing a month before.

And I remembered again. I remembered why it all matters so much.

part 4: be kind

Really, that’s all there is, at the end of the day. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to others. Use your life to be a little, positive part of someone else’s story. And, hey, maybe along the way you’ll solve one of the world’s great challenges; maybe you’ll find a job you really love, or a passion that keeps you going, or both, or neither. But, in any case, you’ll have done something that mattered.

Maybe you’re not the kind of person who needs a drawerful of notes and anecdotes to remind you that, occasionally, the things you do in the world help other people, that they matter. Maybe you’re not even convinced that these things matter at all in the long run, and we must agree to disagree on the premise entirely. Even still, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s someone in your life who might believe these things, who might need those notes to keep going. So, you know, check in on them. Say “thank you.” Because, at the end of the day, who are we except for the people who made us, us?

I want to leave you with a monologue from the play, which is kind of about all of this and is kind of about the passage of time, but is certainly something I believe. It is one of the only pieces of my writing I stand by without a hint of reservation.


RACHEL: I guess, when we lost your dad… I didn’t know what we were gonna do. And I was so afraid that we would forget him. And, in some ways, we have. People we love will always be entering and leaving our lives. We’ll never be able to remember every moment precisely, every laugh and smile, every kiss and every disagreement. These things fade, and that’s okay. KEVIN: But what if I don’t want to forget? RACHEL: Memories fade, but their impacts don’t. You know how people say “you are the company you keep”? That’s what they mean. The people you spend time with change you, and if you remember that, and you honor the ways they changed you, well—maybe that’s the best way we can remember them.

"MIT Admissions Math Month, Part 1 – Duality",Andi Q. '25,2,2024-04-20T00:00:00-04:00,"Did you know? Of all 7,238 MIT Admissions blog posts before this one, 
        only four
      
 contain equations typeset in \(\LaTeX\). And they’re all Paolo’s!

That changes today. MIT exposes us to so many beautiful mathematical concepts, so Paige and Fatima have challenged us bloggers to write posts about these concepts this month. To kick off this challenge, let me tell you about duality – a neat little concept that shows up everywhere, from algorithms to superconducting circuits.

What is duality?

As a non-mathematician, I think it’s hard to define duality succinctly yet intuitively. I usually just kind of wave my hands and say, “Uhh, it’s like when two things are different, but they’re actually the same.” So instead of attempting to define it, here’s a concrete example.

Suppose you draw two points on a sheet of paper.



If you want to connect those two points using a straight line, there’s only one way to do it. So we say that two points define a line.



Now suppose you draw two lines on a sheet of paper (but make the lines infinitely long).



Assuming these lines are not parallel, they intersect each other exactly once. So we say that two (non-parallel) lines define a point.



This is a duality! Points and lines are clearly different, but these two statements reveal a striking symmetry between them.



(Minor spoiler for Paige’s post: You can represent points as coordinates \((a, b)\) and lines as equations \(ax – b\). Try turning points into lines and vice versa, and see what happens!)

Duality shows up everywhere in mathematics. Wikipedia lists a few dozen famous examples, and I’m sure there are hundreds more that people have discovered.

Applications to engineering

In addition to being fun to think about, duality is an S-tier mathematical concept to me because it often applies to physical systems and helps simplify complex problems. Specifically, I use duality to analyze electrical circuits.

In physics, electric fields (\(\mathbf{E}\)) and magnetic fields (\(\mathbf{B}\)) are duals. For every equation involving \(\mathbf{E}\), there’s an equivalent equation involving \(\mathbf{B}\), and vice versa. You can see this symmetry in Maxwell’s equations 
        in a vacuum
      
:

\(\begin{aligned} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0 &\qquad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 &\qquad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \end{aligned}\)

As a result, every circuit component that does something with electrical charge has a dual component that does the same thing with magnetic flux. For example, capacitors (components that store charge) and inductors (components that store flux) are duals:



\(\begin{aligned} i = C \frac{dv}{dt} \iff v = L \frac{di}{dt} \end{aligned}\)

In fact, every circuit has a “dual circuit”, where voltages in the original circuit correspond to currents in the dual circuit, and vice versa:

An example of dual circuits taken from Wikipedia

Furthermore, the current (flow of electrical charge) in the dual circuit represents how magnetic flux flows through the original circuit! Again, this is thanks to symmetry:

\(\begin{aligned} v = iR + L \frac{di}{dt} + \frac{Q}{C} &\qquad v = \frac{d\Phi}{dt} \\ i = \frac{v}{R} + C \frac{dv}{dt} + \frac{\Phi}{L} &\qquad i = \frac{dQ}{dt} \end{aligned}\)

This particular duality is especially important for me because I do research with superconducting electronics, where it’s often more convenient to describe circuits in terms of magnetic flux flow instead of current/voltage. For example, 
        Josephson junctions
      
 are weird devices that require a whole page of quantum mechanics to explain in terms of current/voltage. But when viewed in terms of magnetic flux flow, they’re essentially just switches – much easier to understand than quantum mechanics!

Duality is a gift that keeps on giving, and I hope we’ll see even more of it in the other bloggers’ posts this month.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-20-at-2.15.56%E2%80%AFPM-400x286.png

What Your Campus Wheels Say About You,Emiko P. '25,4,2024-04-20T00:00:00-04:00,"Something I learned very quickly when I first got to MIT is that our campus is deceivingly large. Freshman year, I made the unfortunate decision to attend the 9 am option for my physics lectures – which was admittedly a bit optimistic on my part. The mornings I had physics, I would wake up at 8:50 am and frantically dash from my dorm to class. Nothing will ever feel as far as that walk 
        from New Vassar to the physics building.
      
 

That was my first taste of trekking around campus. MIT’s campus is a whopping 168 acres – which is 1.5x bigger than Vatican City! To get from one end of campus to another, such as from Tang Hall to the Sloan School of Management, it would be a 
        1.2 mile walk.
      


This may seem a bit daunting, but don’t worry! There is a solution: the almighty MIT time. MIT time is a rule that applies to 
        every single class at MIT
      
 that states that class starts 5 minutes later and ends 5 minutes earlier than its scheduled time. While MIT time helps, it’s not quite enough, so all of us have had to come up with some ways of getting around campus a bit faster.

That brings us to our topic today! There are many different modes of transportation around campus, and each has its own pros and cons and silly stereotypes. So here’s what your chosen mode of transportation says about you.

1. Bikes

You are down-to-earth. You are very diligent, and everyone wants to be your partner in a group project. You probably like to hike or do something outdoors-y. You’re a pro at avoiding 
        the most dangerous thing on planet Earth.
      
 A car has definitely almost hit you while turning off the bridge, and ever since then you’ve been wearing a helmet. You properly lock up your bike in the rack, although you sometimes forget where you locked it up and for a split second you think someone stole it. You do not cause issues, and everyone should try to be more like you.

2. Blue Bikes

You are not to be confused with the people that own a bike. You got the $40 yearly Blue Bike deal for students, and now every time you and your friends go somewhere that requires more than 5 minutes of walking you say, “Well, we could just Blue Bike…” You probably take some classes at Sloan, and you will be seen pedaling furiously down the sidewalk with your MIT Sloan backpack bumping along with you as you try to make it to class on time. You are a bit chaotic, but you embrace it, and everyone loves you for it!

3. Razor Scooter

If your transportation of choice is a Razor Scooter, you live on campus or in Cambridge – and it is very likely you are a male athlete in a fraternity. You ride the scooter in packs, with three of your fellow male athletes accompanying you on your journey. You never ride them particularly fast – in fact, you rarely scoot faster than walking pace. You usually park them in piles outside of the locker room or outside of the dining halls. You’ve come to terms with the fact that, when it rains, your pants will be perpetually wet from the wheel spray. You are nice and often let your friends use your scooter when they’re in a time crunch. They’re all a bit rusty from overuse, but your Razor scooter has been with you since freshman year, and you will continue to use it until you graduate.

4. Electric Scooter

You are a menace, and you most likely live across the bridge in Boston. Other students find you annoying because you zip around campus, narrowly avoid pedestrians, and casually gun 20+ mph on the bridge – yet somehow you’re still always late to class. Your friends always try to convince you to let them hitch a ride on your scooter (which involves a weirdly intimate ride as you both cram onto the scooter and hang on for dear life). You either drive a literal tank (200 pounds, can go 50 mph) or something with two wheels and a slapped-on motor that they then called an electric scooter. You are on your second scooter because the first one was stolen! Because you’ve ridden it so much and because Boston streets aren’t exactly smooth, your scooter is in disrepair, and you should probably go get that fixed instead of 
        duct taping it over and over again.
      


5. Skateboards

You are cool and a bit of an enigma. You like to skateboard over the Charles River – and with the wind whipping your hair and the sun rising over the river, you are definitely giving off main character energy. You are an academic weapon, you always help people out with PSETs, and you do it all while maintaining this certain level of chill-ness. You have unbreakable confidence, and your ability to gracefully roll over cracks and not face plant is awe inspiring. Also, you definitely either ski or snowboard.

6. MIT Shuttle

MIT has a couple of shuttle systems: some that take you from your off-campus housing in Boston to campus, some that are inter-campus, and some that take you to places like Trader Joes. If this is your mode of transportation, you are just trying to go about your daily life. You probably have submitted at least a dozen complaints about the inconsistency of the shuttles, but you are still loyal to them because you refuse to get a scooter. Your entire schedule revolves around the shuttle and when it will pick you up. You spend a lot of time at the Stud, your daily workout comes from sprinting to make the shuttle in time, and you like to hang out with others while you do homework. You like seeing your friends on it in the mornings, and when it gets cold and snowy out, riding the shuttle home with the squad always makes you feel cozy.

7. Others

If you are any of these other ones, then you’re someone that makes MIT unique and fun. These others include people that rollerblade (especially that person that rollerblades down Massachusetts Avenue with a Hydroflask balanced on their head – you’re so cool) and that one guy that just rides that giant wheel around. Also, shoutout to the people that just walk. That’s what’s up.

At the end of the day, just remember folks: “It’s not about how you get around, but how much you get around” – anonymous skateboarder. Have fun whipping around campus and keep doing your best to make it to class on time!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG-20240419-WA0006-800x1067.jpg

Snippets of Iceland,Allison E. '27,3,2024-04-17T00:00:00-04:00,"2024 has been quite a year for the Sun—in addition to the total solar eclipse, this year is also a 
        solar maximum
      
. In particular, this means the aurora borealis/australis are at their brightest, and since flights were also relatively cheap,  for spring break my friends and I decided to travel to Iceland!!

This was my first time ever traveling with just friends (no Real Adults^TM?!?), and it was a lot of fun! We planned out an itinerary, booked a hotel, found places to eat, and somehow explored a different country without falling into any volcanos. The scenery was beautiful, the food was tasty, the nearby park had mini trampolines, and the wind was trying to eat us. It felt so very college :D

I won’t bore you with the details, even though it was AMAZING and I feel so lucky, but I did write a handful of rhymes for giggles on our bus rides, so here’s those interspersed with some photos of Iceland (that kinda? match? not really? maybe?).

Sunrise at the harbor in Reykjavík, Iceland’s capital!

there’s the harbor, see it glisten? snow capped mountains in the distance wind is whistling if you listen there’s the harbor, don’t you miss it

—————

walking, walking, slowly walking, uphill, downhill, rarely talking sun is rising, ships are docking, we forge onwards, always walking

Buildings in Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland

the wheels on the bus go round and round driving all ’round the town there’s light snow dustings on the ground in iceland

Roundabout amidst the lava fields

around around the roundabouts where hidden people lay we merge on in, we turn back out continuing on our way

—————

these lava fields, pale green and red would make a very prickly bed, but thankfully the moss provides a 
        cushion
      
 soft as wooly hide

Sólheimajökull glacier! We got to hike on it :D

snow and ice and ash afoot the bluish hues all caked in soot the ground split wide with large crevasses water melts and time, it passes.

the sky is high, the clouds hang low the night is lit with ghostly glow the plains stretch out for miles below and waves crash slowly, row by row

—————

and finally, my pride and joy:

total eclipse of the cruft,Chris Peterson SM '13,0,2024-04-16T00:00:00-04:00,"this post is a little delayed, for which I plead CPW

Like millions of others, I traveled to northern New England to see the total solar eclipse on April 8th. I had happened to see the total eclipse in 2017 in Idaho during an emergency burnout vacation when I drove ~2,300 miles around the mountain west, and it was an incredible experience, so I knew I had to see it again, and bring my family this time.

what if we gathered in vermont and stared directly at the sun…ha ha jk…unless?

I know some current bloggers went, too, and will be posting their experiences soon. But a number of alum bloggers did too, so I asked if I could collect their old-timey tales. To be honest, the experience isn’t describable, and I didn’t even attempt to take pictures. But some of our cruft are better at words and cameras than me, so here are some of those who responded to me.

Here in Dallas, the cloud forecast was looking gloomy all month and up to the morning of April 8. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time staring at the blue and gray contours of satellite weather imagery and learning the difference between GFS, ECMWF, and NAM. But like magic, 8 minutes before totality the clouds totally dissipated and we had perfect views of the eclipse. In these images you can see ruby-colored solar prominences, planet-sized loops of plasma hanging off the sun. You can also see Bailey’s Beads right on the edge of the eclipse, caused by rugged craters on the moon’s surface. Truly a magical experience that you have to see in person. (Minor digression: through a stroke of luck, my car rental reservation for a sedan was upgraded to an enormous fuel-guzzling pickup truck. As a Californian who normally drives a pragmatic efficient EV I’ve now been radicalized to being a Truck Guy, much to the chagrin of my wife Steph C ’15).

These days I am a high school science teacher. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to travel to the path of totality and I didn’t take any pictures, but I did collect temperature and cloud data for NASA with the Globe Observer citizen science project. This graph shows the temperature change experienced at my location, which saw about 93% coverage. I’ll be using this in my classes in a few weeks to introduce radiation heat transfer to my physics students!

My partner Cory ’13 and his high school friend Robert and I roadtripped to Bangor, Maine, to see totality in Millinocket, Maine. In total we drove (well, Robert drove; I worked in the back of the car and Cory played Mario and Rabbids) 12 hours, including four there, four back, and four in traffic from Millinocket back to Bangor. We hiked in the snow during the eclipse leading up to totality, squinting up at the sun getting eaten by the moon like a cookie through eclipse glasses and the Celestron 12x50mm solar binoculars I’d bought for the occasion (one of the very last two from Walmart online, the other of which went to my dad for his birthday). Robert and Cory had rescued a guy whose car got stuck in the snow-mud, and he and his dog Radar hiked with us until they got to their eclipse-watching spot. When we got back to the car, another guy’s car was stuck in the snow-mud, but he was embarrassed and didn’t want help. We watched the rest of the lead-up from the car, and then, when it started getting dark, from outside. It got dark, and grey, but not like at sunset, and sharp shadows came out, not at all like the soft shadows at sunset. It got cold. I put on my sweater (it had been t-shirt weather all day) and then my jacket over it. We could see planets shining in the sky. Everyone was quiet; even the sound of traffic was gone. Dogs barked. The actual event was extraordinary. It was like everyone here describes it, and it looked just like the photos in this blog post. It was worth the drive.

Welcome to CPW!,Jessica Z. '27,0,2024-04-10T00:00:00-04:00,"Last week, my photo gallery reminded me that roughly one year ago was my CPW! Interspaced between pictures of Boston and campus were other assorted pictures—midnight karaoke, bleached hair, and lots, lots, lots of free food—that reminded me how much I enjoyed exploring MIT for the first time as a prospective student. In light of it being the night before CPW, I wanted to highlight a few pieces of general advice I had :)

Explore the different dorms! 

I knew I wanted to live in Burton-Conner as soon as I went on a dorm tour during CPW. It helped me get a sense of all the important details, such as the living space, community, distance from campus, etc. Each floor in Burton-Conner also has a different culture (which you can read about more here), so you can also visit each floor’s events!

For example, my floor is holding
        a few events
      
 in our
        flounge:
      


- Studio Ghibli Movie Night (4/11 @ 10:00pm)

- 
        Pottery and Paint (4/12 @ 6:30pm):
      
In Burton-Conner Porter Room as part of the BC Bonanza!

- Super Smash Bros & Other Games (4/12 @ 8:00pm)

- Nail Salon & Build a Pirate Ship (4/13 @ 4:00pm)

 

Go to Midway!

Nearly everyone goes to Midway, so this is kind-of a CPW given, but Midway features student group booths to show student life culture at MIT. Each booth will have club members there, so you have the opportunity to ask any questions about the club or MIT life in general. There’s also lots of free merch, like t-shirts,
        stickers,
      
tote bags, and snacks.

This year, I’m on the other side of Midway and helping to run the MIT Society of Women Engineers Chapter and MIT Student Events Board booth. Throughout CPW, there will also be other academic booths set-up by different departments to talk about their research, classes, and program offerings. I actually learned about MIT’s Washington DC Internship Program through one of the undergraduates at a Course 17 booth, which is what I’m doing this summer!

 

Alsooo, go to community-specific events!

A lot of clubs will hold CPW events for you to get to know the members of a certain community in a casual, fun way! Nearly every sorority, fraternity, and independent living group hosts CPW events for you all to talk to current members and start thinking about if you want to join one of their communities. For me, I went to one of FLI@MIT‘s events last year, and I remember it was nice being able to ask students questions in a less formal setting than a traditional Q&A panel. Would highly recommend exploring the different communities on campus and asking students any specific questions you have while you’re there :)

 

On that note, talk to new people!

I spent a majority of my CPW talking and going to events with people I already knew, but I wish I had spent more time meeting new people and asking questions instead. You’d be surprised at how many people you meet for the first time that you end up seeing again (and it’s also nice to meet and talk to so many different people in a casual environment)! For example, I talked to someone one time at CPW because we were hosted in the same suite. We both now live on floor C4 now :0

 

…but also don’t burn yourself out <3

Towards the end of CPW, I was really tired. This isn’t a universal experience—a lot of my friends spent every moment of CPW at an event, talking to people, or doing something around Boston, and they really enjoyed it. For me, though, I wish I took more time to decompress, so also make sure to take care of yourself in the rush of CPW :’)

 

Lightning round advice from the Class of 2027:

- 
        “Don’t let the rain ruin the vibe, we promise you’ll grow to like the rain (hopefully)”
      


- “Walk around Boston and take at least one sunset picture by the bridge”

- “Go to events even if you’re not sure you’ll join the club. I ended up joining a lot of clubs I wasn’t initially interested in!”

- “Highly recommend trying Mike’s Pastries and Toscanini’s”

- “Go on a lab tour! They are very fun, and you can usually talk to the lab’s professor about their work if you’re particularly interested :)”

 

In short: have fun, come prepared with
        a raincoat or umbrella
      
, picture yourself on campus, talk to new people and upperclassmen, try new things, walk around Boston, take breaks when you need to, and eat lots of free food.

Welcome to campus! By the last day of CPW, I was already mentally committed to MIT for the next four years, and I hope you all will feel the same :)",,0
finding place,Uzay G. '26,0,2024-04-07T00:00:00-04:00,"finding place

Note: these are some retrospective thoughts on my experiences finding place at MIT. I reflected back on the patterns and evolutions, but in the moment I mostly don’t think about this stuff consciously.

I haven’t posted in a while. Too long. It’s been one of the semesters.

MIT has taught me a lot of things about community. I was in a small high school, and although I made good friends, I always felt a bit isolated within my technical interests.

When I got to MIT, looking back I think I felt like I was a little kid walking into his first candy store. I was astounded by all these people with whom I had a lot of shared technical context/passions, organized into all these different colorful communities. Here are some pics, looking back (omitting a lot because I don’t want to personally identify anyone)

At the same time, it was a hard semester for me due to all the life changes of being frosh (first sem is hard!) and a challenging math class. So I spent the social time I had everywhere and nowhere. Dashing around, not sticking around long enough to build anything solid, with some lucky exceptions. You can’t rely on serendipitously bumping into people at university and a huge campus. You need to be more intentional, unless they literally live next to you.

I was not on top of things and was mostly unaware of how things were playing out. I remember, during IAP (Independent Activities Period), I was out watching the stars with a good friend when he called me out and said man, you need to be careful because last semester you came into some people’s lives for a quick burst and then flaked out.

I am very grateful for that call out. He put himself out there and give me an outside persective that was very important. I had been volatile.

On the other hand, that period was also illuminating. It gave me perspective on MIT; the different scenes, as well as the type of people I want to hang out with. And that there many people I’d like to see but won’t have the capacity to make it happen unless they do.

At the end of fall semester I was starting to feel tired of some of these shallow things and had met people I really appreciated.

But then I got hosedddddddddd in the spring. The people I interacted with became a small group of friends and the people I would work with. Many of the latter became the former (MIT students would utter the words trauma bonding, I won’t go that far). Community got submerged. I don’t recommend doing that, but it did teach me my limits. Some pics:

Finally, spring ended (and with it the hosure), summer passed, fall rolled around, East Campus closed, and I moved to Burton Conner (these are two different dorms) with a good roommate. I had more time, and I was definitely no longer wanting to explore as much. So I got closer to some. But my friends are spread out and my interactions were one on one. It’s a lot of effort sometimes though! It means you mostly have to interact with people through focused conversations or situations where you’re using your brain and talking about life.

party in room

I threw a party in my room with roommate! This was really interesting. It was spontaneous but fun. Throwing a good party is really exhilarating and in general putting on events where your friends meet each other/grow the cohesion to turn into a group is nice.

Now, I live in Pika. Pika is very fun, and I feel at home. I’m trying to do more outings and have a bit of a group going on, which is great.

This semester I went to Mexico with some besties.

Nearing the end of my second year, I have a much stronger sense of place at MIT. This happened mostly through just putting myself out there and trying to bring people together to do fun stuff. For example, a few days ago, a friend and I decided we wanted to drive down for the eclipse so we hit up some other people and now it’s happening.

I am much more grounded and maybe less socially excited than that bright eyed kid freshamn fall. But I still feel the wonder of this place. I know myself and where I am, a bit more.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ramen-800x600.jpg

the spring force, as expressed by Hooke’s Law

This past spring quarter, I felt like a spring. Specifically, like an undamped oscillator. My days swung wildly up and down. The more I pushed myself, the greater response force I’d feel on my energy levels. Calmness remained at a distance. But, as I approached spring break, assignments finally wound down and days became less packed. My graph dampened into a steady state.


  
          
        
      
          
        
      
      
  

Nine days of spring break: what to do with them? I feel like I’ve experienced both ends of activity levels: doing all the things and doing mostly nothing. Last year, my friends and I packed our bags for a bustling East Coast adventure. This year, we went on a Canadian road trip and spent our days chilling in the woods. Here are the tales of how both of these trips came together:

2023: New York, NY and Washington, DC

Last spring, we (Asal V. ‘25, Caitlin O. ‘25, Isaac L. ‘25, and I) had an ambitiously packed schedule. Our agenda came together by reaction. During the winter, I found out through the news that the Phantom of the Opera, the longest running Broadway show of all time, was ending its 35-year run. So, we booked tickets and set on going to New York to catch the production in its final days. That was all we planned to do. But then…

A few weeks after making that decision, I received an email that I originally thought was a phishing scam but actually ended up being from the White House Office. I think I had reason to raise an eyebrow because it requested for sensitive information like my social security number. I even forwarded it to my friends to ask if they, too, thought the email was suspicious. The email was an invitation to the White House for celebrating the 2020 Biden Presidential Campaign team. Back then, I worked as a Community Organizing Fellow and, later on, Data Analyst for my home state of Nevada. I was really thrown off by the email because it came 2.5 years after my time on the team but, I guess, made sense because COVID-19 had finally become manageable. I was allowed to bring a few guests, so spring break made the most logistical sense. Suddenly, our group was tasked with hitting two major cities of the East Coast. 

Day 1 (3/24, Friday): Drive to New York

We 
        (and by “we” I mean Caitlin)
      
drove from Boston to New York. I always enjoy long car rides with my friends. We blast tunes, indulge in snacks, and share stories. Some of my best laughs have happened while sitting in the back of a mini-van, slightly delirious from being in one space for such a long time. Every ride feels the same—like home. 

Day 2 (3/25, Saturday): Broadway

Our one big thing, which was the impetus for this leg of the trip, was to see Phantom of the Opera that evening. It felt like we were just filling in the rest of the day with things in anticipation of the show. We…

- Explored the Google store because Caitlin is a Google fanatic

- Bought an Apple Airtag to stow in our car because we were paranoid the car would be stolen. We were staying in the cheapest reasonable Airbnb we could find, which meant being in a sketchy neighborhood.

- Visited Stonewall Inn for fun

- Thrifted some fun clothing pieces at the Buffalo Exchange

- Stocked up on stationary at MUJI

- Saw Phantom of the Opera <3!!! Caitlin and I saw Phantom while Isaac and Asal elected to see Hamilton. Phantom was simply breathtaking.



Day 3 (3/26, Sunday): Comedy Show

We had a more-chill day after such a packed day prior. We…

- Ate fantastic Malaysian food

- Walked the High Line, which is a beautiful train track turned public walkway

- Tagged along with Isaac to B&H, a film store, because he needed something for his camera. There was a really cool open transportation system in the ceiling where you could put a package into a machine on one end of the store and have it transported to the other. 

- Naively sat in the front row of Sunday Sqool Comedy, a comedy show by Ashley Gavin (who used to work at MIT!), during which Isaac got roasted. We all had watched her TikToks and were amazed we got to see her in-person. 

Day 4 (3/27, Monday): Quintessential NYC

This was our last day in New York, so we made sure to check off quintessential New York activities. We…

- Ate lunch with MIT Concourse professors and staff

- Perused the MET

- Strolled Central Park

- Visited the 9/11 Memorial

- Wandered The Oculus, a mall inside the World Trade Center

- Had dinner in Chinatown

Then, Cait drove us to Washington, DC, we settled into our new home for a few days, and drifted off to bed. 

Day 5 (3/28, Tuesday): White House

The scheduling for our White House visit had a short, rigid time window, so the planning of this leg of the trip revolved around it. We came in aware that most museums—even the really huge ones—are free, so had a full-on museum day. We…

- Toured the White House. It was very cool to be able to actually walk inside after hearing about it our entire lives. It’s kinda small when you compare it to other Washington buildings.

- Ate breakfast at Founding Farmers DC

- Met up with our MIT friend Jade D. ‘25 and enjoyed the cherry blossoms. This time of year was peak bloom, so it was especially nice to see the flowers.

- Visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture

- Visited the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History

- Visited the Washington National Cathedral

 

Day 6 (3/29, Wednesday): Museums

The weather was beautiful, so we decided to spend much of this day outdoors and soak it all in. We…

- Visited the US Holocaust Memorial Museum

- Visited the National Gallery of Art

- Went paddleboarding in Tidal Basin

- Frolicked in tulip gardens at the Floral Library

- Laid in the grass in front of the Washington Monument

- Perused the Lincoln Monument

 

Day 7 (3/30, Thursday): Capitol Tour

Several months ahead of our trip, I contacted my Congressional representative to see if they could show my friends and I around. Their office kindly arranged for one of their staff members to give us a private tour, which was the centerpiece of our day. We…

- Toured the US Capitol, during which we also got to go inside the 
        House Chamber!!!
      
 We didn’t realize that was part of the tour. It was surreal. My policy minor heart was pumping. Politicians that we normally only saw in news articles and videos were now right in front of us. The only thing between us and them was air. We even got to watch them vote and actually pass something. It was especially cool watching what groups they self-arranged in. I also didn’t fully understand that the house reps work together in the same big room. Like, they are working physically near their closest colleagues and fiercest opponents. We could’ve spent all day watching the chamber in action, but had to move on with our days. 

- Stopped by the Statue of Liberty, per Asal’s request, on our drive back to Boston.

We did so much and had so much fun but, boy, were we so tired. I’m glad we embarked on the journey together, but made a mental note to bring it down a few notches the following year. 

2024: Nova Scotia, Canada

We learned our lesson from last year. We needed to take an actual break. Instead of doing many things, we decided to do essentially nothing. This year, we were the same crew plus Malachi M. ‘25! While planning for our trip, we searched for places we could get to by car and that were more woodsy. We’re more of a “cute cabin in the foggy forest” type-of-crowd than an “island beach getaway” type-of-crowd, at least for this year. A week prior to our planning meet-up, I discovered the song You’re So Vain by Carly Simon and Malachi discovered the song Fire & Flame by The Longest Johns, both of which were respectively our first exposures to the name “Nova Scotia.” I volunteered the idea of this place and, after ruminating amongst our options, we decided to take the province on. Our group found an adorable A-frame cottage tucked in the woods and right up next to a lake. Off to Canada we went…

Day 1 (3/25, Monday): Drive to Nova Scotia

We underestimated our endurance for the long drive. Google Maps said it would take 11.5 hours but, with our food stops and border control in-between, it took us 15 hours to get there. The drive up was beautiful: wistful fog that faded into endless rows of trees, soft rain trickling down, and an orange sun that gleamed in quaint ponds. When we reached the province of Nova Scotia, I frequently turned my head to look around, only finding endless darkness trailing behind us. It was opaquely black. We were, indeed, deep in the woods. 

I kept thinking “wow, this would be a good place to get murdered right now” which, of course, did not happen. I also kept finding myself thinking happy thoughts about my friends. Despite all the cold and foreignness of the weather around us, we were safe in our little pocket of warmth. In that car was an air of comfort and love. When not singing songs or telling tales, I looked around the car and thought about reasons why I loved each individual person. I’m really thankful for my friends.

We eventually arrived around 
        3am,
      
unloaded our car, and immediately knocked out. 

Day 2 (3/26, Tuesday): Errands

Because of our late arrival, we woke up very late the next day. We felt hungry and wanted to spend most of the day in, so we went to a diner, Walmart, and headed back home. The American diner was… questionable. It was inside of a gas station and took up half of the building’s interior. I think the youngest customer aside from us was probably in their 60s. We felt somewhat watched by everyone else because we were a young, diverse group, but not in a bad way. Just an “oh that’s new” kind of way. 

At Walmart, we spent too much time searching for basic foods. The girlies who live in cook-for-yourself dorms volunteered to cook dinner: Cait for today and Asal for tomorrow. After we got all food ingredients and some firewood, we headed back home. That night, we played Tetris and Street Fighter on Isaac’s Raspberry Pi, ate Penne a la Vodka pasta prepared by Cait, and watched Nimona on an outdoor movie projector while soaking in the Airbnb jacuzzi. I slept well that night. 

Day 3 (3/27, Wednesday): Lounging Around

We planned to go out and then we didn’t.

We, once again, woke up quite late. So late that we pushed our plans to go out to Halifax, the main city in Nova Scotia, to the following day. The only “outing” we had was visiting the nearest convenience store, buying firewood, and coming back home.



Day 4 (3/28, Thursday): City of Halifax

We planned to go out and then we actually did! We…

- Ate lunch at Gangnam Korean BBQ

- Visited the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site

- Grabbed pastries from Pan e Circo per recommendation by Isaac’s cousin, who works for the city of Halifax.

- Tasted ciders at Bulwark Cider House & Cafe per recommendation by Ceri Riley ’16. I knew she had been to Nova Scotia before, so I asked her for recs before we embarked on our trip. Though we couldn’t pursue most of the recs because we were staying in a different area that she was in, I’m glad we were able to check off one place.

- Went on a nature walk at Point Pleasant

- Ate dinner at an Italian place

- Played video games at home

- Watched Poor Things

they look so cute 🥺

Day 5 (3/29, Friday): Drive back to MIT

I’m currently sitting in the back of the car typing this out. This morning, we checked out at 11am and headed on our route home. Our ride so far has been mostly the same as the way in, but the fog is absolutely insane. I’m impressed by Cait’s driving. The fog was so dense that, at times, we could barely see beyond a few feet in front of the car. Snow started to heavily pour down after we passed the border. We’re 4 hours from home. 

 

On arrival, we’ll be dropped off one-by-one at our dorms and return to our normal, academic lives. We’ll miss the time we’ve had, though we’ll still continue to see each other basically every day. Travelling has a way of bonding friends: you experience the new with the old—foreign sights with familiar people. We’ll leave this trip with stories. As the sludge of the final stretch of the semester catches up to us, I’m confident that we will, together, make it through the oscillations of this coming spring.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/What-is-damped-and-undamped-oscillation-400x352.png

2026 ring premiere!,Teresa J. '26,1,2024-03-28T00:00:00-04:00,"★ a recounting of Premiere

(Oops, it’s been like 1.5 months since) Ring Premiere happened!

For almost a year now, I’ve had the privilege of being on the Class of 2026 Ring Committee! Ring Committee, also known as RingComm, is a group of twelve students tasked with designing the Brass Rat for their class. 

If you don’t already know, the Brass Rat is a class ring that MIT undergraduates receive at the end of their second year. It has an extensive history (that I won’t go into but you can read about it here and here) and has made appearances on the fingers of Tony Stark, the John Harvard statue, and soon, my classmates.

In the several months leading up to Premiere, RingComm had been moving in silence. standing on business, even. working on the ring design in private. In order to ensure the secrecy of the design until Premiere, we even resorted to taping CVS pharmacy receipts and crumpled pset packets over the door window of the classroom where we’d meet twice a week.

But on February 10th, it was finally time to unveil the design to the entire class!

The day started off rather unassuming. For the first few hours, my tasks consisted of lugging boxes of t-shirts and 
        toothpick holders,
      
 blowing up balloons and fluffing up decorative pom-poms, and testing how far I could reasonably chuck various mini beaver Squishmallows into the auditorium seats. By 5pm, we’d finished running through our dress rehearsals and setting up decorations. All that was left for the committee was to get changed and get hyped. 

At 6:30pm, doors opened. I was holed up backstage as my classmates were filtering into Kresge Auditorium, but I could slowly hear the ambient sounds get louder and rowdier as more and more people filed in. At some point, I poked my head out to assess the crowd situation, and saw various greek life/living communities and friend groups dressed in funky hats and group costumes, as is custom for Premiere.

Finally, at 7:05pm, lights dimmed to outrageous cheer.

This year RingComm tried something a little new for Premiere – we filmed short little video skits to play before each duo walked on stage to present. By the time Hailey P. ‘26 and Sean H. ‘26, our Co-Premiere chairs, walked on stage to kick us off with the Hacker’s Map, the decibel levels in the room were insane. Shrieks and hollers broke out every half a sentence, and the crowd only got louder as the presentation progressed. Sabrina C. ‘26 and Jamie O. ‘26 were up next with the Cambridge and Boston skylines, followed by Nathan K. ‘26 and Vicky C. ‘26 with the Class Shank, and then Marco A. ‘26 and Katrina L. ‘26 with the Seal Shank. I practically knew everyone’s lines by heart and I could still barely figure out what anyone was saying over the noise.

Jamie came back to present the winner of the 
        Puzzle Sprint,
      
 who won a free 14k gold ring! After that, at long last, it was time for me and Ann L. ‘26, two of the artists on RingComm, to present the Bezel!

As our video faded out and we walked on stage, we were greeted by a wall of sound. The sheer enormity of Premiere kind of hit me all at once. We forgot to track attendance, but Kresge seats around 
        1200,
      
 and from what I could see squinting against the bright lights, it looked pretty damn close to being full. People always say that Ring Premiere and Ring Delivery are some of the few events in your undergraduate career where you get to see so many people in your class all gathered in one place, and I knew this, but it was still absurd to witness. After months and months of hard work and sealed lips, we were finally getting to show the class of 2026… the Bezel!

…just kidding. Ann and I actually had the honor of presenting the Joke Bezel, i.e. a silly, fake Bezel that usually precedes the actual Bezel, because we haven’t kept our class waiting long enough. 

After getting boo’d offstage (lovingly, I’m sure), we handed the batons to Helena U. ‘26 and Maggie Y. ‘26, RingComm Chair and Vice-Chair, to finally present the real Bezel! With that, the entire ring design had been unveiled!

Overall, lots of elements of the design remain similar to what you traditionally see on a Brass Rat, but we added a few unique elements that I particularly like. On various sides of the ring, we show an archer beaver, a sailing beaver, a pistol beaver, and a fencing beaver, to represent the four P.E. classes needed to obtain a Pirate’s License at MIT. 

Additionally, we included a night sky motif across the ring as a nod to how, like the beaver, our best work as MIT students often happens at night. For example, the Cambridge Skyline, which is usually depicted in the daytime, was shown against the night sky in our rendition. Even the hacker’s map took the form of a starry constellation, to guide us through the tunnels just as people once used stars to navigate the seas. (Also, if you look closely, you can see a beaver hidden in the Hacker’s Map constellation – we managed to feature a beaver on every face of the ring!) If you’re curious about the rationale behind other design details, feel free to read more here!

The hype hadn’t ended just yet though. Marco and Katrina, our co-Delivery chairs, returned to announce where the class of 2026’s Ring Delivery would be held! Ring Delivery is the big fancy event where everyone actually gets the rings that they ordered post-Premiere. This year, our Delivery is going to be on May 5th, at the top of the Prudential Center!

Finally, the night was coming to an end. Ring Premiere concluded with the committee members each launching an aforementioned beaver Squishmallow into the crowd! With that, it was a wrap!

★ a recounting of being on RingComm

Just to be upfront, being a member of the class of 2026 Ring Committee is a lot of work. 

The first time the twelve of us all met as a group was actually volunteering for the class of 2025’s Ring Delivery. Our first opportunity to get to know each other was through forced proximity – the ‘25 Ring Committee had us running around sorting over a thousand rings alphabetically, breaking down cardboard boxes, squinting at IDs and spamming Ctrl + F on a check-in spreadsheet, desperately tracking down literally any person who knew how to refill the water dispensers, and whatever other 
        mundanities our class of 2025 overlords demanded
      
 of us.

However, our work didn’t really begin until a few months later, during the summer. Our first task was to design a logo that would be used later down the line for all of our posters, brochures, website, etc. After many car-ride sketches, Zoom calls in a hotel kitchen in the Canadian Rockies, and only an hour (not bad!) of mulling over slightly different hex codes of gold, we finally had our logo!

Our next biggest undertaking was actually designing the ring, which took six hours of meetings per week over a big chunk of fall semester. 

I think a lot of people, MIT students included, have kind of a misconception about how this process actually goes. Not everyone on the committee is an artist; rather, roles range from web chair to publicity chair to treasurer to being in charge of the various events we hold throughout the year, such as study break, Premiere, and Delivery. (Also, shout out to our Chair and Vice-Chair <3) Historically, a minority of the committee actually has the title of an artist. The class of 2026 RingComm, for example, has three – me, Ann, and Vicky.

By no means are we the only ones who played a hand in the design of the ring, though! In fact, it truly is a group effort. All of the committee members spent a lot of time poring over past websites, logos, ring designs, etc. picking out elements we liked or didn’t like. This helped us decide our direction for the ring design and/or the general 
        ~vibes~
      
 we wanted to give off. On top of that, each member brainstormed various elements we thought would memorialize the class of 2026’s MIT undergraduate experience.

As artists, our job was to help turn the ideas of the committee into reality. If someone wanted to play around with the idea of including a solar eclipse on the seal shank, or see what the soccer players on the bezel would look like shifted a millimeter to the left, we were on hand to quickly sketch or make adjustments so the committee could see how the design was shaping up in real time.

On top of that, we worked closely with professional artists from Herff Jones, the company that manufactures our rings. They gave us immediate feedback on how well certain details would translate to the small surface of the ring, and ultimately they were the ones who drew the final designs and 3d models in order to manufacture the actual rings.

Each side of the ring came with a lot of iterations. Each time we’d meet, we’d add new ideas or cut back on others; we’d make the tiniest microadjustments, like changing the beaver’s tuft of cheek fur on the Bezel or making sure the Lobby 10 doors are centered on the Class Shank; we’d do everything we could to make sure the design was as close to perfect as we could get it. Below are just a few out of the 
        dozens of iterations
      
 we made for the Bezel! 

Artists had other responsibilities, too! We were in charge of making designs for everything from posters to stickers to t-shirts! A lot of our work was concentrated around fall semester, but we were on call year-round to help make pubbing materials and merch for all the events.

So yeah, RingComm is undoubtedly a lot of work. But I love it nonetheless!

I think it’d come out kind of cheesy and try-hard if I attempt to explain how much RingComm means to me. It’s become a huge part of my life, not just because of the six hours of meetings every week. Everyone on RingComm is so awesomely clever and fun to work with. They’ve become my ride-or-dies; we’ve weathered many ups and downs as a committee, and I’m so excited to see all of our hard work be celebrated at Ring Delivery.

Not to mention, to know that I got to play a part in designing something so iconic, so steeped in tradition and ceremony, is amazing to me. I’ve seen Brass Rats on superheroes and in local cafes, and soon, come May 5th, nearly 98% of my classmates will own the very Brass Rat I helped create. It’s unbelievably fulfilling and mind-blowing. 

As a preview, all twelve members of RingComm have a temporary, 
        sample Brass Rat
      
 in various colors and sizes so our classmates can get an idea of what they’ll actually look like. At Ring Delivery, we’ll swap in our placeholder ring and receive our actual ring alongside everyone else! As it stands, I’m pretty used to wearing chunky rings, but the Brass Rat carries a different weight to it altogether. I guess the knowledge that donning one means I’m joining the ranks of decades-worth of Brass-Rat-wielding MIT students gives it a little extra heft.

an unsolicited review of the whitney biennial,Gloria Z. '26,5,2024-03-25T00:00:00-04:00,"Last weekend, I took a short solo trip up to New York to see the Whitney Biennial! I’ve wanted to go to the Whitney Museum of American Art for years, ever since I learned that they’re host to (almost) all of the paintings Edward Hopper made in his lifetime. So, when I learned that the biennial was opening this year on March 20, just a few days before the start of our break, I impulse-bought bus tickets to Penn Station. And so down to New York I went.

But first, what exactly is the biennial? From Wikipedia:

The Whitney Biennial is a biennial exhibition of contemporary American art, typically by young and lesser known artists, on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, United States. The event began as an annual exhibition in 1932; the first biennial was in 1973. The Whitney show is generally regarded as one of the leading shows in the art world, often setting or leading trends in contemporary art. It helped bring artists like Georgia O’Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, and Jeff Koons to prominence.

Basically it’s a big show that the Whitney puts on every two years, with a different overarching theme each time. It’s known for 1) focusing on American art, 2) showcasing less established artists, and 3) being overseen by primarily in-house curators (as opposed to inviting external ones). The Whitney has also been putting more focus on accessibility in recent years, in that they’re trying to break down the pretentiousness and elitism that so often clouds the fine art world.

yippee

The 2024 theme is “Even Better than the Real Thing,” alluding to questions of authenticity, identity, gender, nature, and AI. I personally feel like the theme didn’t have a particularly strong presence in the selection of works, but that’s really not a complaint. The show featured 71 artists and collectives, with many of them working in video, installation, and sculpture. It took me about four hours to get through all of the works on display, which spanned floors 1-6 of the museum. Here are some of my personal favorites, in no particular order!

PS sorry in advance for the terrible quality of the photos I took. all quotes are snipped from the museum description cards <3

 

The Past Awaiting the Future/Arrival of Drummers by Maja Ruznic

“[This painting] looks at how multiple things can be true at the same time: birth, violence, pain, suffering, joy and music… The movements suggested by the figures’ feet… collapse these temporalities into a single symbolic image.”

Contrapposto by Jes Fan

“…created from 3-D printed CAT scans of his own body… Contrapposto is composed of one of his vertebrae, copied six times and draped over a metal structure, turning the skeleton inside-out to become the skin. Glass forms hand-blown by the artist and his team resemble body organs inside.”

deepest ocean, what we do not know, we might see? by Suzanne Jackson

“[Jackson] made these suspended paintings without canvas, slowly building up many layers of acrylic, detritus, gel medium, and objects from the natural world, including seeds from her garden… the paint becomes an armature for itself.”

TRAY TRAY KO by Seba Calfuqueo

(video piece; the still image below is from the Whitney website)

“Draped in an electric blue fabric, the artist acts as a conduit between the tangible and the spiritual… This meditation on fluidity, literal and symbolic, also works against other perceived binaries, including that of gender.”

Proxy by Takaka Yamaguchi

“[Her seascapes] reflect Yamaguchi’s experimentation with what she calls ‘abstraction in reverse,’ or taking recognizable forms, like clouds or waves, and abstracting them to the point of pattern… The luminous surfaces are intentionally decorative and structured using graphic techniques drawn from Mexican muralism and Japanese print design alike.”

Lacunae by Mary Kelly

“Kelly starts with the calendar… and uses it as a framework for exploring what may be the most profound disruptions to our sense of it: the seemingly arbitrary fits and starts of aging and the passing of friends and loved ones… Together, the ash and the transparent vellum of the printed calendars invite the viewer to reflect on materiality as well as the body and its final passage of transformation.”

In Her Time (Iris’s Version) by Diane Severin Nguyen

(video piece; the still image below is from the Whitney website)

“Nguyen explores the ways that history circulates in the present–largely through popular media, partly as memory, and partly as re-creation or even fan fiction… fiction and reality fuse as she explores the limits of the ways history is told and uses re-enactment as a vehicle for visualizing the future.”

Afferent Nerves by P. Staff

“…an idea that reimagines the gallery as a kind of body, permeated here by a sense of danger. Staff bathes the installation in an acidic yellow light. A live electrical net hangs above the gallery, out of reach but audibly buzzing… a particular trans mode of being that exists in the tension between dissociation and hypervigilance.”

Air I Breathe: Radio by Holland Andrews

(sound piece; listen to it on the Whitney website (scroll down))

“…located in the stairwell, [created] entirely from vocal sounds that at times have an ambient effect and at other times offer a range of harmony, dissonance, and melody… the work meditates on the sensation of receiving information on multiple channels, as if the mind were switching stations on a radio.”

Air I Breathe: Radio is close to an hour in length, but listeners will likely only hear it for a minute or two at a time as they move from floor to floor. I thought it was so cool that the experience of traveling through the show was also scored with audio like this, and the piece itself is so enthralling, especially as you descend or ascend around the speakers suspended in the spiral staircase.

Disclaimer that I am so far from knowledgeable about contemporary art, but I did really like the show for the most part. I felt like it captured the current climate of the USA quite well–both in a political/social sense and in a literal climate change sense. I particularly liked the work that spoke directly to a state of being–in stasis, or peril, or temporality–especially Staff’s installation and Fan’s sculptures. And I stood for an entire hour until the pads of my feet were aching, absorbed into Nguyen’s 67-minute length film.

I don’t really have a benchmark to base my thoughts off of, as I’ve never been to a biennial or wide-ranging curated show like this, but I was pretty surprised by how many video-based artists there were (as opposed to painters). There were also a couple large-scale pieces located on outdoor terraces, but I had checked my winter jacket, so I only stayed outside for a few seconds to take them in–enough for the bitter cold to sting my skin–before slipping back inside. Besides the physical works on show, there are also many more films/ live performances associated with the exhibition that I didn’t get to see. I believe some of them will be viewable online at some point, and there are pictures of most of the static work online as well. But I would definitely recommend visiting in person, as everything is better when you see it in real life. One might say–even better than the real thing :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_7785-400x300.jpg

Something to chalk about,Andi Q. '25,2,2024-03-24T00:00:00-04:00,"MIT is a 168-acre playground for the world’s brightest undergrads, and nowhere is that more apparent than at Simmons Hall – my beautiful, spongey dorm. We have cats! A ball pit! And we can even draw on the walls! Not with paint (as students used to do in East Campus and Burton Conner) or crayons though, but with chalk.

I blogged about some of the awesome chalk murals in Simmons last year, but 
        many were erased over the past summer
      
. It was a sad day when we moved back in and saw they were gone, but now we have a whole new batch of murals, thanks to the talented artists living in Simmons! So here are some more pictures of awesome chalk murals from around the dorm.

Big thanks to everyone who sent me pictures for this post!

B1ner Cribs,Amber V. '24,2,2024-03-24T00:00:00-04:00,"It’s been 16 years since the last installment of Burton 1 Cribs, an extensive tour of rooms on 
        B1
      
 by Jess. K ’10. A few things have changed — postcard-sized posters are in vogue, and we’re not allowed to paint the walls anymore, but we change the space with wicked lighting setups. So much is the same: our rooms are well decorated with posters and projects, and they’re full of good vibes and other 
        b1ners
      
 dropping by.

Without further ado, here are 11 rooms:

Emily ’25

Emily: i think i made my room too cozy this year because i just stay in it all day…. i love the way i have it set up. i especially love staring at my line of books on the windowsill i just think its so cute. sometimes people will just knock on my door (or not) and sit on my beanbag and hang out with me which is super fun. two people who are not me have slept in my bed this year lol. shoutout list for doing slap because the framed art really pulls together the room decor and makes me feel like an adult

 

Nunu, Ria, and Aarushi ’26

our room is decorated with posters and trinkets we’ve each gathered over the past two years.

Nunu: my freshman year, i ended up on b1 by chance but i am so thankful i did. i’ve found life long friends from living here. mit is hard but having b1 and my two roommates as my support system honestly makes it so much fun. i love b1 so much!!!!!!!!!!

Aarushi: i’ve never had a room before that really feels like mine, because all the decor of my childhood bedroom is from when i was a child, and i never spent time decorating my room last year. the room isn’t even just mine, but ria and nunu make our room feel like home.

Ria: B1 is my home!! Every party, study break, or floor event just reaffirms my love for this floor and everyone on it. Our room is so cozy and well decorated and having the best roommates makes it the best living experience I could ask for.

Kyna ’25

Kyna: my room is infinitely sexy. so many people fit in my bed. I love boners!!!!!!!! but seriously, while I couldn’t find the energy to clean my room and take pictures, these are all pictures just from my life :) I’m so happy to have a room where me and my friends can be silly and hang out and play games. also projector and projector screen is mega cool!

Layla and Ronnie, ’26

 

Layla and Ronnie, two freshmen on floor, have collected so many cool things for their shared room! Featuring: the star light above Ronnie’s bed, which was a group room purchase to create more soft light. Also: the lamp on her desk, which she found in an antique shop while on a family road trip in Texas, and the necklace holder on the wall from a vintage shop in Boston!

Amber ’24

I tried making my room nice this year! I love having all of my books unboxed and on display – even if I don’t have time to read many of them, I love the continuing habit of having them pile up. My tools have become so useful in B1; I’ve loaned out the hammer, pliers, and thimble in the last few weeks (Sofia and Val have tools to share as well).

Val ’24

Selena ’24

 

“Noooo don’t take a picture it’s too messy” ~Selena

Megha ’25



(poster edited because the blogs are not supposed to be political. b1 however is very supportive of political action for those who choose to engage, and we have members in lots of awesome action-oriented clubs!)

Anon ‘2X

Doreen ’24

Tangela ’25

Otherwise known as Taylor and Angela

Paolo

Our very own blogger AND GRA!! Paolo runs the wackiest, awesomest events. This one involved putting tape on objects around their apartment, drawing on the tape, adding labels to random objects, and eating lots of fruit!

 

And that’s a wrap! I personally have been wowed by peoples’ creativity and art as I’ve uploaded these pictures — I hope y’all were, too.

Have fun decorating your own rooms next year, wherever you go. And if you’re coming to MIT this CPW, come check out B1! :D","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1972-Emily-Wong1-21-800x600.jpg

welding 1000 digits of pi,Kanokwan T. '26,4,2024-03-23T00:00:00-04:00,"On pi day, campus was buzzing with events.  That morning, I even planned out all my pie stops: a Project Manus makerspace mentor social, Laureates and Leaders Induction Ceremony, East Campus social, and Simmons Hall social. The pies were oh-so delicious.

I want to share with you some pictures and videos from one of the events. 
        Project Manus,
      
 the easiest way into the MIT makersystem, hosted an event where makerspace mentors welded on digits of pi to a steel apparatus. This project has been in progress since 2019. Over 140 students contributed by spot and arc welding 850 digits of pi.

We may be running this as an event during CPW (Campus Preview Weekend) where anyone can learn to spot weld 5 digits of pi, and mentors/staff can arc weld them into the sculpture… still figuring that out.

Almost to 1000 digits!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_2860-1000x1648.jpeg

Pirates and Pi and Rats and Pie and Rats (except there are no rats),Kayode D. '27,6,2024-03-23T00:00:00-04:00,"I [started] writing this blog on 3/17, and it’s the warmest day that there has been in a while. I was outside writing this blog in Killian Court, but the sun was causing too much glare so i’m in the library right now. This last week has been a doozy. 

Pirates

This semester I’m taking 4 classes: 
        8.02
      
, 
        18.02
      
, 
        2.S02
      
, and 21M.299. The last one is a world music studies class about “Pirate Songs and Whaling Chanteys.” and it’s AWESOME. 

How the class works is we read a book by some salty New-England sea dog from the 60s, then we talk about it, and then we sing Sea 
        Chanties
      
 for the last third of class. It’s great. I’m learning so much about sea songs, and sailors and pirates and–

It’s all fake. Pirates Shanties aren’t real. You’ve been lied to. 

The Golden Age of Piracy was from 1650-1739, and the Chanties as we know them didn’t really flourish until the 19th century aboard large shipping vessels. So if pirates sang, it wasn’t the sea chanties we know of, and it wasn’t like Captain Hook and Mr. Smee. Also, most of the shanties people typically know of aren’t even real shanties. A “Historical Chantey” was a work song sung to coordinate a heaving task (like spinning the capstan to raise an anchor) or hauling task (like raising the sails). Modern day shanties, like Wellerman or Hoist the Colors are not work songs, but instead just “maritime music” that often gets associated with shanties because the definition is very loose. But I digress, I will write a pirate blog at some point.

Our class has been planning for weeks to do a Chantey sing at MIT, and on 3/13 we did just that. We made posters and hung them up around campus, and from 2-3:30, we sang in Lobby 7. 

 

It’s like a DLC to the MIT Pirate Certificate. My favorite Chanteys [although they are technically maritime songs, not sea chanties] so far have been The Mary Ellen Carter, Crossing the Bar, and Too Funk For the Folkies .

Pi

MIT goes HARD for Pi day. The Alumni Association has been sending emails (that i don’t think i ever read…) for weeks about an event in lobby 10. Thursday I saw what they meant. 

 

 

They were doing a contest to see who could recite the most digits of pi, and the highest score was my friend Nina O., ‘27 with

digits (!!!) Good job Nina!

They also had a claw machine, with pi day merch inside. I wanted to play, but unfortunately the line stretched the entire length of the lobby. Then I did something I’m not proud of. 

A man from the alumni group announced that if you donated 5 dollars you could skip the line. The actual thought that went through my head was “Free Will Friday,” and I blurted out that I would do it. I wanted a t shirt! So I donated 5 dollars, and that meant I could skip the line. 

Then I realized I would actually have to skip the line. Of like, 80 people. I felt awful. The guy told me to just go up there and play, but I didn’t even want to do it anymore. These people had waited so long and I just paid 5 dollars to skip all of them. I apologized profusely for taking advantage of this blatant scam for donations, before I lost 3 tries in a row and high tailed it out of there. 

I am deeply ashamed of this. 

Rats

There are no rats in this story. 

Pie

Every dining hall and their grandma’s house was serving pie on pi day. Whether it be pizza pie or real pie, everyone was getting a piece. Even Alan Z., who got pied in the face at Next House. 

When I made it back to Simmons, I got late night food and (surprise surprise), there was pizza pie. Let me say, though, that this was the single greatest pizza I had eaten this semester. Most Boston Pizza is floppy, and I’ve yet to find a place with good pizza structure and firmness. Idk, New England Pizza just isn’t hitting as hard as what you could get from say a …Midwest Pizzeria. But that’s a story for another time. 

Rats

Well, I guess there are some rats in the story. 

I didn’t realize until recently that the phrase “Aw, Rats!” wasn’t a common one. I’ve been saying it for years, and recently that people seemed to think it was odd. One of my friends said it was a very Kentucky thing to say. 

I thought about it and I think that I got the phrase from my mom. I don’t have any distinct memories of her saying it, but I feel like it’s something she would say. Or maybe I just got it from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 

Maybe the Real Rats Were the Friends We Made Along the Way

I guess another big thing that happened this week was on Wednesday. I was coming back from a blogger meeting where we talked about blogs and things and i made a shameless plug for *ahem* Midwest Pizzeria, and I realized that it had been a full year since last Pi Day. I had grown so much, and learned more about pirates than I ever thought I would. But the icing on the cake was after I had left. 

I was walking in the 
        outfinite
      
 because it was finally warm, when I saw my fellow Kentucky friend, Kaleb T. ‘27, down the ways a little bit. He was longboarding with a can of soda in each hand. When he saw me he shouted, 

“Which one do you want?” 

I laughed and told him that I was ok.

“No, you’re taking one,” he said and he thrusted them towards me as he got closer. I reached out and grabbed the Canada Dry in his left hand as he skated away. I couldn’t help but laugh out loud. 

Kaleb had grown. I remember meeting him at the KY student meetup and he seemed almost hesitant about coming to MIT and leaving KY behind, but look at him now! Giving soda to people in the street! If he could grow then so can I, and so had I. It was the first time since getting here that I didn’t just think that I belong here, but that a part of MIT belongs to me, too.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/photo-1-800x600.jpeg

classes i’m taking this spring,Fatima A. '25,4,2024-03-22T00:00:00-04:00,"after long deliberations and email exchanges with the transfer credit examiners, i registered for what i hope will be the equivalent of 48 units at MIT.

there are some key differences in academics between MIT and here. firstly, people mostly take classes in only their own major. i had the choice to take one class outside my major but decided to stick to math classes only. it was a little intimidating at first, i have never taken only math classes or, as many math classes in the same semester.

the other difference is that there is more room for a self-guided pace. concretely, this means that my classes all have weekly problem sheets or tutorials, which look like problem sets, but we do not have to turn them in every week. instead, there are only one or two courseworks you actually have to submit for each class in the entire term. this is because a lot of your grade is the final exam at the end of the term (in the summer term, technically).

perhaps, a direct impact of having less coursework is less opportunities for collaboration. i might be biased because i don’t know as many people here but i don’t think it is just that.

here are some thoughts on the classes i am taking.

I. Functional Analysis

i originally signed up for this class mostly because the pure math major requires you to take a second analysis class beyond real analysis and i had not fulfilled that requirement yet. in hindsight, it was a really good decision! the professor for this class is a really, really good lecturer so the lectures are very interesting. i am also gaining a new appreciation for analysis. i took real analysis when i was but a confused freshman and so, i never really liked analysis before.

one way to think about dimension is to see how many variables it takes to describe a space. for example, in order to describe any point in the real plane, you can give its x and y coordinate so it is 2 dimensional. we look at finite dimensional spaces in linear algebra courses. roughly speaking, functional analysis is an extension of linear algebra to infinite dimensions where unintuitive things begin to happen. an example of an infinite dimensional space would be the space of polynomials with real coefficients. you would have to give the coefficients of {1, x, x^2, x^3, …} to describe any polynomial, which is an infinite number of variables. (Paige B. ’24 talks about dimensions here and helped me exposit this!)

the course revolves around the properties of complete spaces (which means spaces in which sequences for which subsequent elements eventually get arbitrarily close (Cauchy) have limit points (convergent). think holes. so an example of a not-complete space would be rational numbers. i could take a sequence of rational numbers approaching an irrational number and then, there would be no limit point for this sequence in the rational numbers.) 

we talk about linear operators that are continuous, or equivalently, bounded, and their various properties including extending maps from linear subspaces and talk about various notions for convergence using these linear operators. 

II. Statistical Theory

i wanted to take more probability and statistics classes, having enjoyed the one introductory course i took in the past and since this is, in some sense, the equivalent of the course people at MIT often take after the introductory probability course, i decided to go for it. 

my class started by introducing exponential families (families of statistical models that behave nicely) and then went on to talk about various ways of estimation. essentially, one wants to infer something about the true distribution of the data from the given samples and there are different ways to do this. we talk about the frequentist and the Bayesian way of thinking about statistics. the frequentist way treats the parameter we are looking for as a constant whereas the Bayesian way involves having some prior beliefs or knowledge about the unknown parameter, represented through a distribution (called the prior), and then adjusting your views or beliefs after looking at the data to a new distribution (called the posterior) on the parameter.

III. Geometry of Curves & Surfaces

i have really wanted to take a course in geometry for a while now. the first, shorter part of the course talks about regular curves, their tangent vectors and their curvature. the second part of the course defines regular surfaces and then defines their tangent spaces and the notions of curvatures for surfaces. regular surfaces are “nice” spaces that locally look like the Euclidean plane.

we learned how to take differentials on arbitrary surfaces. because the tangent vectors at a point in a surface are given by derivatives of curves lying on the surface passing through that point, then the differential of a map at a point is defined between the tangent spaces of the two surfaces that the map is defined on.

we talk about the intrinsic and extrinsic notions for curves and surfaces. one can think of these as what someone living on the curve (or surface) would experience versus what someone who is looking at it from the outside knows. think about this example: if you are living on a curve, you will not be able to distinguish between a straight curve versus a very “curvy” curve i.e., all curves are intrinsically flat. this is why we only talk about the extrinsic notion of curvature for curves. another example could be (from The Shape of Space): take a sheet of paper and compare it to if you bent it into a half-cylinder-like shape. if you are a little being living on this sheet of paper, you cannot tell the difference between the two (intrinsic) but if you are looking at the paper in 3-D, you can tell the difference between the two surfaces (extrinsic). so we have extrinsic and intrinsic notions of curvature for surfaces.  (may talk about curvature in a later blogpost!)

IV. Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning 

given that the class is with the maths department and is literally called “mathematical foundations,” i should have expected it to be theoretical. and yet.

the class defines learning, goes into theoretical explanations for convergence of different optimization methods etc. we talked about neural networks, gaussian processes, convolutional neural networks and are now talking about variational auto-encoders. i am just throwing words at this point, but the only funny thing out of all of this is seeing KL divergence in class last week (sponsored by my friend, matthew).

this course is different from the other courses because it is coursework only. we had our first coursework due a couple weeks ago and it was ~65% theory and ~35% coding although i still struggled with the coding a lot more. in addition to being bad at it, i just did not like the whole try different things, wait for an eternity for your code to run, then try more things. i was able to get guidance from the TAs though, which was really helpful!

i am glad to have chosen this class because machine learning feels so interdisciplinary. i saw someone’s dissertation on a category-theoretic approach to deep learning (which i have not actually gone through but would like to). apparently, people tried to use ML models for topology to see if they could find useful patterns and invariants of spaces and apparently, they did find some stuff. this is also not something i know very well but i would like to learn more about it at some point!

i had been scared at the thought of graduate school and doing only math because i have had at least one HASS every semester at MIT, but this semester has made me more confident that it will be fun! four years seem like such a long time but almost three years in, i feel like there is so much more i want to learn that i just have not had time for. so, although it feels so scary to think about graduate school, i am also very excited to be able to learn a lot more.

i had also been scared of completely forsaking writing poetry if i was not required, for one reason or another, to write it but that has also not been true and it is very reassuring to know that.

MIT Regular Action Decisions Now Available Online,Chris Peterson SM '13,0,2024-03-14T00:00:00-04:00,"MIT Regular Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2028 are now available in the application portal. To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking View Update. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update. 

This year — inclusive of both Early and Regular Action — 28,232 students applied to join the MIT Class of 2028. As of (checks watch) right now, we have offered admission to 1,275 students who will have the chance to collectively climb the mountain that is MIT. They hail from all 50 states, 58 countries, and nearly a thousand different high schools. Though their interests and aptitudes range widely — biomimetics and basketball, metallurgy and merengue, oceanography and orienteering — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with MIT’s mission to use science, technology, and other areas of scholarship to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind. We can’t wait to welcome them to our campus to join the outstanding undergraduates who already call MIT home.

There are also students who may be climbing other mountains, with other fellow mountaineers, next fall. Of the students to whom we do not offer admission today, we have placed a modest number on our waitlist and informed the balance that we will not be able to admit them to the Class of 2028. Getting to “meet” so many capable, compassionate students through this process has, as always, left us bleary-eyed and reminded us that what we do is more than a job: it is a privilege and an honor. We are grateful to have walked this short part of your path with you. 

If you are among the many stellar students to whom we are not offering admission, then I want to remind you success is not always a straight line. Your future isn’t something MIT creates for you, it’s something you manifest for yourself. And if you spend the next few years trying to make wherever you are as amazing as you can (as you already are), then someday you’ll look back on this Pi Day and realize it all worked out okay.

I’m closing comments on this blog post to concentrate conversation in the open threads for those admitted, waitlisted, and not admitted, respectively. Answers to frequently asked questions for waitlisted students can be found here, with more information about next steps to come in early April.

Congratulations to the Class of 2028, and best wishes to all of our applicants. No matter where you enroll next fall, please make it a better place. I know you can. I hope you will.",,0

No Ceilings,Paige B. '24,6,2024-03-12T00:00:00-04:00,"Part 1: (literal) There are no ceilings.

For some reason, in a lot of buildings around campus, MIT would rather have pipes and wires and such along our ceilings than actual ceiling tiles and what not:

Insert obligatory meme response:



Part 2:  (metaphorical) There are no ceilings.

When I was in high school, I knew (in some vague sense) that my undergraduate education was going to open many doors for me, regardless of where I ended up. In hindsight this was true, and I’ll circle back to this idea later. But when I got here, it didn’t feel like doors were opening.

Instead, it just felt like I was taking one step at a time. When I started my freshman year, I simply looked up classes I was interested in/ones that fulfilled requirements, I signed up for them, and off I went. Because I had attended a community college in high school, it didn’t really feel all that different; there is a goal in mind as a student (graduation, for one), and you just start working on that goal.

You just, take the next step.

And sure, you might have dreams and goals of what’s going to happen 100 or 1000 steps from now. From graduate school to being a professor, or from medical school to being a doctor, or becoming any 1 of millions of things you could possible be. But you can’t get to the 1000th step without taking the first. Or the second. Or the 999th.

When I started college, I used to think these steps would be huge:

- Go to college.

- Go to graduate school.

- ???

- Be a professor.

But in reality, each step can be incredibly, and somewhat unintuitively, small. Before I really got into blogging, I used to post my “steps” to Facebook, and they were simple, but meaningful. They still are.

I am now in my final semester at MIT. I am preparing for graduate school, which used to feel 100 steps away (when in fact it was almost 1,000,000), but now it’s here. Everything I’ve done up to this point has felt, at the time, like the right next step. And because it felt like the right thing to do at the time, in some sense it was the right thing to do at the time. But I look back on my time here, and I can’t help but feel like it was mostly luck.

I was lucky that I got to take the classes that I did in the semesters that I did them. I was lucky to have gotten research opportunities that made me a better mathematician (also don’t worry, the math research blogpost is coming out soonish I just wanted to write this post first). I was lucky to get the opportunity to be here.

And while luck may have played a role in some of these things, it isn’t the whole story.

I worked hard to take the classes that I did in the semesters that I did them. I cold-emailed multiple professors for my first research opportunity, and worked hard when I had one. I put in the work in high school, and took a leap of faith and applied to MIT.

I took the first steps, and I kept working hard.

Getting into MIT was one small step on my journey that got me to where I am today. But had that not happened, I would’ve kept walking. I would be somewhere different, and I almost certainly would’ve been a very different person (at least in the ways that were shaped by MIT). But I would’ve taken the next step.

I am now in my final semester at MIT. I am preparing for graduate school, and am realizing now that all of my goals feel 1,000,000 steps away. But as I reflect on my time here, looking down on all the stairs that I climbed to get to where I am today, I am left understanding for the first time that there are no ceilings. And I could go on a long rant about how that feels specifically true at MIT– the place with literally no ceilings, and with pipes and wires and such instead. But that doesn’t feel true.

There are no ceilings because I kept walking and will continue to do so. There are no ceilings because dammit I’m gonna keep pushing hard to get to follow my dreams. There are no ceilings because you can always take the next step. This isn’t Zeno’s paradox. You’ll keep moving forward.

In two days from now, MIT is going to release undergraduate admissions results. And though I don’t have any clue what’s going to happen next, I am certain you all are going to keep going along your individual staircases. And I, for one, can’t wait for you to take those next steps.

I, again, leave you with one of my favorite quotes.

“Believe in yourselves. Dream. Try. Do good.” “Don’t you mean do well?” “No… I mean, do good.” —Boy Meets World.

“Believe in yourselves. Dream. Try. Do good.” “Don’t you mean do well?” “No… I mean, do good.”

—Boy Meets World.

You’re going to do great things.

IAP Cooking,Jessica Z. '27,4,2024-03-10T00:00:00-05:00,"I live in Burton-Conner, which is a cook-for-yourself dorms, but I purchased a meal plan last semester for convenience. I didn’t cook often and pretty much lived off of avocado toast in the morning and Maseeh dining for lunch and dinner. I got slightly sick of dining hall food after a while, though, so when prompted with the option to buy a meal plan for
        IAP,
      
I didn’t.

Simultaneously, my friends and I realized in late December that we were just a few days away from
        finishing our first semester at MIT
      
and entering IAP. We also had two other realizations: 1.) we still had to feed ourselves and 2.) we had an abnormal amount of free time on campus.

For some background, we are 100% self-admitted poor cooks. We cooked together once before for Friendsgiving. We burned the mashed potatoes,
        spent an abysmal amount of time making pasta,
      
and ended up dropping the turkey. I’m much more of a baker than a cook, and my friends also didn’t have a lot of cooking experience. In an effort to both improve our cooking skills and spend more time with each other, we decided to make a cooking group together!

We quickly made a Google Doc to brainstorm a list of food we wanted to try to make, as well as organize our cooking schedule. Roughly thirty meals later (and two months late…), I wanted to share some of my favorite memories from cooking over IAP!

January 8: Pasta

First day of IAP!
        In the spirit of being unconfident freshmen with cooking,
      
we opted to make a college staple: pasta.

We were cooking for six people, but we ended up making
        wayyyy too much pasta.
      
So much so that leftovers were packed for everyone, and we still had more. One of my friends also brought back Southern Illinois cookies for us to try. I wasn’t sure what makes a cookie a ~Southern Illinois~ one, but upon asking my friend, I’ve learned that a cookie becomes Illinois-ified if they’re from a local Illinois bakery. 
        Who would’ve thought?
      


lots lots lots of pasta

January 9: Bibimbap

Bibimbap is a Korean rice dish that usually has crispy rice, sautéed vegetables, marinated beef, and is topped with a fried egg and bibimbap sauce. Ours was much more bootleg due to limited ingredients and skill, but it was still pretty good. Minus one very burned egg, nothing went wrong! Would 100% make again. We all collectively cut and ate a piece of the egg in solidarity. 

makeshift bibimbap!

collective solidarity in eating this egg (would not recommend)

 

January 13: Baked Potatoes + Chocolate Banana Muffins

We had three friends join us for dinner! Two are also MIT ’27, and one is from another college. We met last June at a summer camp, and they were visiting Boston over the weekend. The meals at our summer camp were a bit questionable at times—one of the notable ones being baked potatoes—so we wanted to recreate that for him visiting.

I also baked some chocolate banana muffins. Unfortunately, I already put the batter into the muffin tin before realizing I forgot to add an egg. However, instead of just pouring the batter back into a bowl and mixing in an egg,
        I chose to crack an egg into a separate bowl
      
and spoon 1/12 of the egg into each muffin compartment. 100% not the most effective, but A+ for effort!

now image spooning 1/12 of an egg into each of these

 

January 22: Noodles @ Lanner Noodles 

We also wanted to use IAP as a time to try out new restaurants nearby or in Boston. One of my friends sent an Instagram post showcasing a video of hand-pulled noodles at a newly-opened restaurant called Lanner Noodles. One unifying factor in our group is a shared love of noodles, so we immediately booked a reservation.

We ordered chili & garlic stir-fried cabbage and
        various soup noodle dishes
      
to try. Cambridge has a lot of really, really good food, but this was one of my favorite places I’ve ever eaten.

i <3 noodles

 

January 26: Pizza 

Our commitments started to die down a little more towards the end of IAP, and we had a bit more time to dedicate towards cooking. We followed this general recipe to make pizza, and we ended up with two very big pizzas that tasted pretty good. We also made the dough from scratch, which I was personally very proud of :)

they tasted better than they look i promise

 

February 1: Random Leftover Food

February 1st was the last day before IAP officially ended, and we wanted to clear out all the leftover food we had accumulated. We did a pretty good job detailing what ingredients and how much we needed to buy for our
        weekly grocery store trips,
      
but we inevitably ended up with strange amounts of random food. After taking inventory of what was left, we had:

- 1 bag of kale

- 1 jar of pasta sauce

- 
        Many onions
      


- A lot of parmesan cheese

- Tortillas

- 1.25 bags of rice

- Leftover chicken

- Pasta shells

- 
        Heart-shaped pasta
      


- 1 lb frozen ground beef

- Feta cheese

- Many eggs

- 2 bags of sandwich bread

- Various asian condiments

- 0.25 bags of Spinach

- Garlic cloves

- Sour cream

- Mini bell peppers

Overall, we ended up with six omelets, pasta with chicken, sautéed kale & spinach, heart pasta soup, quesadillas and a clean pantry!

 

February 2: End-of-IAP & Birthday Sushi @ Bangkok Bento

The last day of IAP was February 2nd, which is also my birthday! My friends ~mysteriously~ told me the week before to make no plans for this evening to celebrate. We ended up going to Bangkok Bento on Newbury Street because Asian food, specifically sushi, is my favorite food. We had a larger group of people, so we opted to get a sushi boat :0

We got ice cream from Emack & Bolio’s afterwards, where my friends presented me with a
        little candle
      
and lighter to make a wish for my birthday. When I got back to my dorm, my roommate and close friend also surprised me with a cake they made; very good day :)

lots lots lots of sushi

cake my roommate and friend surprised me with!

A few questions: Did we get better at multitasking? Did we clean way too many dishes? Did we overestimate the amount of food we needed to make several times? Did we drop and break a plate? The answer is 
        a resounding yes
      
to all of these.

And, finally, the ~most~ important question: did we improve at cooking? 

IAP was genuinely one of my favorite periods of time on campus. I liked working full-time on my UROP, but it was mostly enjoyable because I started cooking more. It was fun to go on grocery shopping trips with friends, cook most nights together, and try out new restaurants around campus. All of us had varied commitments over IAP that still kept us busy—classes, clubs, UROPs, jobs—but it was nice to know that we had a built-in time to de-stress by cooking together.

In the fall, college felt very rush rush rush to me. I had a difficult time balancing classes, clubs, and other commitments, but IAP helped remind me to slow down. I grew up with food being a symbol of appreciation for people; I remember baking cookies for friends as care packages back home, and
        my parents making me my favorite dishes for special occasions.
      
My favorite memories often include food with people I care about, whether it be making Chinese pastries with my grandparents, baking with my brother, or trying new types of cuisine with friends. IAP still felt rushed at times,
        but cooking with a group brought me a lot of comfort.
      


Would highly recommend making a cooking circle—we saved money off of meal plan, got to try new foods, and spent a lot more time together before the even-busier spring semester started :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6612-scaled-e1710095126849-400x251.jpeg

I stared at the river for a while a few days ago. I probably should’ve been doing other things; I had a CV PSET that I had not yet started, and I ought to have been sitting in my room reading the problems. I ignored this and walked along Memorial Drive on the trip back from the UA Meeting. The weather, for the first time in a while, was crisp and cool, the temperature at which you mentally thank the breeze for kissing your skin. I strolled right past Next, crossed the street, descended into the foliage by the Charles, and sat on a large rock.

Bodies of water have an unwritten contract: if you look at them for long enough, they will implore you to think. After hastily clicking through the 6.031 Reading (I’ll have to actually read it in the morning), I removed my airpods, turned off my phone, and watched the scintillations on the surface of the river. 

I was tired. This is unsurprising; it had been a long day and my sleep schedule had been thoroughly destroyed by an inconveniently timed interview. I inhaled what felt like my first breath of the day as the stress of the past few weeks settled deep into my chest.

I was not sad. There was no trademark hollowness. I perhaps felt as if I had been full, until that moment, of too many things. Finding time is hard, nowadays. This semester is far and away my busiest at MIT, having become president of my dorm, picking up a minor role in a musical, and taking six classes. Many days start with a lecture at 9:30 and aren’t over until my last meeting is, up to 12 hours later. This isn’t a complaint. I willingly picked up all these things, and I genuinely like and/or care about all of them. I’m glad to have all of these opportunities to do cool things.

It is strange to feel that there is only ever one thing on your mind, though. That behind the endless meetings, the rigid calendar, the hasty email responses, the skimmed readings, the rushed PSET write ups, all there ever is to think about is people. 

Interpersonal relationships are really remarkably difficult. I often wonder exactly what friendships are even supposed to look like. I’ve been told that my standards for feeling close to other people are too high. The fact that no one will ever fully understand another person bothers me a lot. People are so complex, so variable, with such long histories. Grasping someone on an atomic level, perhaps even grasping oneself to the fullest extent, is nearly impossible. All relationships come with inbuilt upper bounds, which is a fact of life that drives me absolutely insane.

They weren’t lying when they said college friends are the ones you keep. I have friends who have graduated and still get practically stream-of-consciousness information about my day. I’ve divulged things to my friends that I never thought I’d tell another living soul. They’ve helped me get through the hardest times of my life, and I like to tell myself, at least, that I’ve done the same for them.

There are things that I want to be able to do for my friends, responsibilities that I expect myself to fulfill. Friends themselves are in many ways responsibilities – I am thoughtful and care deeply about all of them, there are many which must be balanced, and if any one goes neglected for too long, bad things happen. I worry a lot about my friends, too. Not, really, in the direct sense of being concerned about their ability to take care of themselves, but I certainly worry about my ability to take care of them. I want to be the person whose door they can knock on. I want to be reliable and available and helpful. I want to be able to shoulder what they need me to. 

Platonic relationships are powered on love just as much as romantic relationships are; being friends with someone is a commitment, in a similar way. I will be there for your bests and your worsts. Yes, you can be falling apart. No, I will not think any less of you for it. 

And I think love must be in the little things, right? I text a lot, mostly about inane things. The little blue bubbles are actually wrappers for secret messages. “look at this cute frog sticker!” I am thinking of you. “hi :oo” I hope you’re doing well, and I want to see you.  “I’ve been crying a lot.” I feel safe enough to be vulnerable with you. “I really have to do laundry.” I would like to talk to you about even the most mundane parts of our existence.

I want to always love people carefully, both in choosing who I love carefully and in loving them with special care. Every week, I have nine meals blocked into my calendar for the people in my life, to ensure that I will see them. I am mindful about reaching out to people. I try really hard to make time.

But what if it still goes wrong? How many people is it possible for me to reasonably support? What if I am not there when I am needed? Am I doing this right? Am I doing this well? And perhaps, am I living correctly on the whole? I am trying to do so many things, and I want to do them all well. Am I doomed to fail something or someone? When will I drop and shatter something indispensable? It is hard to feel out of your depths. Being looked to for help or direction is more than a little terrifying.

And, on the whole I have not a single answer. The moral? I do not know how to do this correctly, but I am trying quite hard. There is great earnestness in that. I am running on nothing but good will, effort, and some semblance of experience. I hope I can do this right. I hope it is enough.",,0

Some days are wonderful. Others are tough. And then… there are those days.

the blah

The ones that don’t feel quite right, but you can’t put a finger on why. Everything is ever so slightly more tiresome: each task harder, interaction tougher, and footstep heavier. The day feels oddly still, like time has slowed and all that’s left in the world is you and the void.



The world feels like what can be best described as…blah. I don’t even feel a right to feel bad about those days because nothing particularly negative elicited them, rather, some malaise had washed over me. Then, I remember that 
        feeling bad about feeling bad is circular
      
and probably not a good way to move through life, so I try to welcome the feeling. It’s very human to have these bouts out of the blah.

On one of my days of the blah, I sent an email out to my friends:



fyi: I maintain an email list for my friends. It’s a nice way to still connect with those close to me outside the world of social media, but not quite reduced to only direct text messaging. I like being able to tell longer-form stories and play around with the media of emails. This email list also, by extension, makes emails as a whole less intimidating. I 
        digress.
      


This was on one of the days where there was nothing more I wanted to do but be horizontal, alone, and idle.

This was on one of the days where there was nothing more I wanted to do but be horizontal, alone, and idle.

the junior year existential crisis

These days became more frequent during my junior year, which I think is at least partly attributed to the Junior Year Existential Crisis, where one realizes they’re more than halfway through the institute, questions if they’ve spent their time wisely at all, and panics over what may be after graduation. I feel like I’ve been lucky to have been given a golden ticket and, consequently, that I need to make the most of my time here. MIT gives a great deal of resources to its students. There is a pressure to live up to its promise of trying to make the world a better place. I mean, it’s a good promise. I’m very grateful that this is the stress that I have in my life, as opposed to other things. But, it’s still a weight to carry nonetheless.

These thoughts can and will, of course, happen before and after junior year, but I think it’s especially concentrated in this first year of being an upperclassman. You’re seen as someone who’s supposed to have it together. Truth is, most people, including real adults out in the real world, don’t really know what they’re doing. Most people act like they do but deep, deep down, they don’t. Every now and then, we all wonder if what we’re doing really matters. I think it’s a healthy and good question. It’s part of the essence of being human.

I don’t entirely know what I’m doing myself. I have some semblance of what I want my life to be, but I have more questions than I do answers.

My friends have also been going through this crisis. No matter how bad things may be, experiencing it together with your loved ones somehow always makes it better. I think that’s one of the best things about life. Here are some excepts:

One of my favorite concepts in philosophy is “existence precedes essence,” coined by Sartre, meaning that humans exist before the reason why they exist, well, exists. Take for instance, a knife: their essence is that they are sharp and capable of cutting things. A knife does not exist before it is sharp and capable of cutting things. Its essence precedes its existence. Humans, on the other hand, are put on this Earth and have to forge an essence of their own. We’re tasked with continually answering: what makes you, you?

I really liked the songs from the Barbie movie. The first 3 seconds of Dance the Night are a bop. I’m Just Ken had its moment. And, wow, What Was I Made For? struck a nerve. Here are some of the lyrics:

I used to float, now I just fall downI used to know but I’m not sure nowWhat I was made forWhat was I made for? …

"Andi and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Week",Andi Q. '25,3,2024-03-03T00:00:00-05:00,"Remember two weeks ago when I blogged about how excited I was for this semester? Well, in a dramatic turn of events, I suddenly became super sick and ended up having to undergo surgery a week after that blog post.

Not exactly the best way to start the semester…

But don’t worry – I’m back on my feet now! (Hooray for modern medicine!) Now allow me to tell you all about the experience.

(Now would also be a great time to click away if you’re squeamish about medical details.)

Yay storytime

It all started last Friday when I woke up with a sharp pain in my butt whenever I moved around, almost like being stabbed by a butter knife. I had no idea what caused it (and still have no idea), but I assumed it would disappear within a day and made my way to class.

Unfortunately, the pain did not magically disappear as I’d hoped. By Sunday morning, it had become severe enough that I decided to get it checked out at MIT Urgent Care. I was just a bit terrified because that was my 
        first time going to MIT Urgent Care
      
, but the experience was surprisingly frictionless. Until it was time for the diagnosis, that is.

The doctor took one look at me and diagnosed me with 
        general butt pain
      
, telling me to just live with it for 
        four to six weeks
      
. (Spoiler alert: it was not, in fact, general butt pain. It was actually an infected 
        abscess
      
.) To be fair, he didn’t have a ton of information to work with… but I think it’s still a bit weird how he told me that I shouldn’t be going to Urgent Care for that type of problem.

Anyway, I tried my best to live with the pain for four to six weeks – 
        I even went to all my classes on Tuesday
      
 – but it just kept getting worse until I couldn’t sleep at night. It was time for a second opinion. After dragging myself to MIT Urgent Care again on Wednesday, a second doctor finally diagnosed me with an infected abscess.

yay… :(

I was annoyed that the first doctor had misdiagnosed me, but I had a bigger problem to worry about. Because I had left the infection untreated for so long, I needed to go to the ER pretty urgently to get it treated. And so I made my way over to the Mount Auburn Hospital ER, where they prescribed me some antibiotics after a more thorough examination.

At that point, the pain had become the worst physical sensation I can remember experiencing. It was more like being stabbed by a red-hot poker iron now. Every. Single. Step. I. Took. I cried for the first time in five years. Totally not fun.

But things would only improve from then on! The antibiotics and painkillers worked wonders, and I was already feeling much better by Friday morning. (Still in intense pain and unable to attend lectures, mind you, but well enough to sleep at night at least.)

This is the only photo I took at the hospital oops. (The blood oxygen monitor they used was made by the company that sued Apple for patent infringement and won!)

Unfortunately, I couldn’t rely solely on the antibiotics. Because I had an abscess (as opposed to a regular infection), I needed surgery to drain it at some point. And so I decided to go to 
        MGH
      
 that evening to get it drained. (Mostly because MIT made it clear that I needed to return to lectures the following week.)

MGH was incredible. Everyone there was super nice and efficient, and 
        the medical technology was straight out of science fiction
      
. My stay lasted less than 24 hours, and the surgeon who operated on me was 
        the head of MGH Pediatric Surgery
      
 and likely one of the best surgeons in the world.

And just like that, all the pain was gone! The change was unbelievable. I even had the strength to walk all the way back to MIT… which I indeed ended up doing because the 
        Red Line
      
 had broken down when I came out of the hospital.

So yeah, that’s the story of my worst week ever at MIT. Luckily, it was not all pain and suffering – I learned many valuable lessons, and if this ever happens again (which I hope it will not), I will be slightly more prepared.

Modern medicine is a marvel of science and engineering

At the start of the semester, I believed that the semiconductor industry was the crown jewel of humanity’s science and engineering achievements. I still believe that, but modern medicine is definitely up there too now.

Before my visit to MGH, I never knew medical technology was so advanced. The entire hospital was an interconnected web of smart medical devices that operated together like clockwork. Everything just kind of… worked. (Which was honestly very surprising, coming from an EECS student taking classes about how computer systems fail all the time because we’re not very good at designing them.)

I also read through the list of Nobel Prizes in Medicine and Physiology to keep myself occupied while waiting. It’s pretty wild how we went from lobotomies to mRNA vaccines within a century.

Don’t underestimate the power of music

In 
        MITWE
      
, Fred Harris would often talk about the therapeutic effects of music. And he’s so right. Listening to music was one of the few things I could do to distract myself from the pain, and I was amazed by its effectiveness.

TL;DR: music good. Listen to more music. (And if you’re at MIT and reading this, you should come to 
        our April 20th concert
      
.)

It’s okay to take the elevator

I’m a big fan of taking the stairs instead of the elevator – so much so that I used to pester my friends into taking the stairs around campus with me and get slightly annoyed when I saw people taking the elevator down a single flight. It sounds quite silly saying this, but now I realize that taking the elevator is okay (even for very short trips) because sometimes it really is better than taking the stairs.

MIT’s policies don’t care if you’re sick

In many ways, I was incredibly fortunate in the timing of my illness. I got sick on a long weekend, so I had quite a long time to rest and recover. It was also an “off” week academically (my classes release new labs/psets biweekly), so I wasn’t pressed for any new deadlines either. I drained the abscess on a weekend too, which allowed me to attend all my lectures this week.

But even with all this padding, I still felt a lot of pressure from MIT to just get over my illness and go back to classes. Many classes have attendance policies that significantly affect grades, and many of those policies do not allow excused absences because 
        “there’d be no way to judge one excuse over another”
      
. It’s also sometimes difficult to get homework extensions or makeup exams (especially in big classes), and some professors even suggest dropping classes entirely because of these types of conflicts.

It sucks, but that’s just how things are here.

But the people at MIT do

Fortunately, class policies at MIT often sound much harsher than they are in practice. I ended up not getting penalized for missing lectures that week because I explained the situation to my professors, who were generally quite understanding.

Even beyond professors, people at MIT generally care about the well-being of their peers. My friends were also extremely helpful, and they would bring me food and notes from the lectures I missed.

Healthy habits pay off

Another big reason why I escaped that week relatively unscathed (academically, at least) was my study habits. I always try to start new assignments as soon as they get released. For some reason, many people at MIT (including a few of my professors) think this habit is strange and counterproductive.

“If you have two weeks to do something, what’s the point of doing it all in the first three days?”

“If you have two weeks to do something, what’s the point of doing it all in the first three days?”

But because of my habit, I could take the entire week off and recover from my illness instead of scrambling for extensions. So pro tip – start your assignments early at MIT. Even if your economics class dedicates an entire pset to why you should not.

Listen to your body



(Jokes aside, do listen to your body. Even though the doctor diagnosed me with general butt pain, my body was telling me that it was clearly not general butt pain, and my body was correct.)

Health comes first

Yeah. (You were right, mom. Getting sick really does suck.)

To end on a positive note, I got to go to a professor’s house for a research group party the day after I got out of the hospital. And he has two beautiful cats! Meet Freckle and Blossom:","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5A2B98B2-3E06-4396-91F7-46E723DC6CA4.png

"rural winter, city winter",Nicole Cooper,1,2024-02-26T00:00:00-05:00,"Field of Cows!

Winter in Wyoming—a symphony of snowflakes and ice over barren land sprinkled with old red barns and cattle. It’s a season of rugged beauty, where Carhartts are more a necessity than a fashion statement, and the sharp crack of ice breaking in the horse trough signals the start of another day. Winter in Wyoming is its own beast, a stark contrast to the cozy warmth and twinkling lights of Boston’s snow-covered brick and cobblestone.

Frozen Backyard

The farm during the winter isn’t just about picturesque scenes of snow and charming moments by the fire. It’s about resilience in the face of nature’s fury. Tractors plowing through towering snow drifts, feeding animals in sub-zero temperatures, and backcountry roads becoming treacherous trails.

And then there are tender, yet difficult moments, like calving season, when the bitter cold of twenty-below temperatures seeps into your bones. I can still recall the breath of the cows and horses, illuminated by the soft glow of the moon, bringing newborn calves inside the house to keep them alive. The swish of our overalls as we moved with purpose, the scent of hay mingling with the aroma of wood smoke.

Winter meant my dad starting the cars 20 minutes early before we all piled in for school. It meant the roosters staying put in their coop past their usual morning calls to stay warm. These months seemed to drag on. Living so far from friends meant that my siblings were my main source of company so we braved the elements together often with sleds in tow for a little fun in between hours spent chopping wood to help heat our home. Coming back inside, we’d strip off layer after layer of snow gear, feeling like we’d had a workout just getting undressed. Then there was the sweet relief of the wood stove, where we’d hang our soggy snow pants to dry, grateful for the warmth on our rosy red cheeks. 

Cold Dad at 40 below

Now that I am at MIT, I have found that winter in Boston may be the same season, but it has a different flavor. Instead of the vast expanse of Wyoming wilderness, I find myself navigating the narrow streets and bustling cafes of the city. The familiar rituals of rural life gave way to a more refined existence, where a steaming latte replaced Grandma’s cocoa and a long navy peacoat adorned my shoulders in place of mismatched gloves and brightly colored snow pants or Carhartts covered in stains earned through hard work.  

It’s a funny thing, how something as fundamental as winter can differ so drastically between rural America and city life. I have found myself confronted with a different winter from the one that I know. Winter in Boston is more like short punctuated treks into the cold from my home to the T Stop, from the T Stop, to a cafe, and from the cafe to work. It is no longer about survival, it is more about experiencing the beauty of the season.  

Although, amidst the hustle and bustle of city life, I can’t help but long for the days back home—even the challenging ones. There’s a certain magic in the solitude of rural winters, a sense of camaraderie forged in the face of adversity. I’ve learned to embrace the differences and find joy in the unique experiences that each season brings, whether it’s the quiet solitude of a snowy Wyoming landscape or the vibrant energy of brownstones against the slush of a Nor’easter.

Wintery Boston Street

As I work with rural and small-town students at MIT, I’m reminded of the myriad ways in which transitioning to a prestigious institution like ours can shape their experiences. I’m also reminded of the many small cultural shifts that can make applying to an institution like MIT from a place like Wyoming all the more daunting; while the academic opportunities and resources are undoubtedly vast, it’s the subtler shifts—like trading your morning walk to the barn for a crowded hustle to the Kendall Square T stop—that also play a significant role in their higher education journey.

 By recognizing and embracing these seemingly small but impactful differences, we can make MIT feel like home for everyone, no matter where they come from. I find myself drawing on the lessons of my farm life not only to inform how we create welcoming spaces, but also to help me get through the New England winter: by embracing the coziness during the cold months, while sending warm thoughts to the calves being born in twenty-below temperatures back home.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wyoming4-2-1000x760.jpg

Home(sick) for the Holidays,Allison E. '27,0,2024-02-24T00:00:00-05:00,"Here’s part two of my “I wrote this but procrastinated on editing and now it’s going up months late” series! Today’s topic: winter break :D

On Wednesday, December 20th, I took my last final of the semester. I grabbed dinner with friends at the dining hall in 
        Simmons
      
, and then we walked over to 
        Next
      
 to hang out for a while. Around 10, I left to pack for my flight home, but instead ended up walking out into the big field in front of dorm row. I played some Christmas music out loud in the dark—at home around this time of year, my dad tunes into Christmas music every morning on the drive to school, but I haven’t heard much this year. I sung along where nobody could hear me (hopefully), and laid down in the grass. It was 30˚F, and there were a few stars visible through the Boston light pollution. I let myself pretend to be the main character for just a bit.

After about an hour, I trudged back into my dorm to pack (for real), only to discover that my one and only functional earbud had disappeared. I was not about to take a 12 hour flight with no earbuds, so I trudged back out into the field to begin strip searching the grass with my weak phone flashlight.

And that’s when I discovered that the field was COVERED IN GOOSE SH!T. Put your hands out, palms up. Pretend they’re a patch of grass of the same size. One of your hands has a piece of goose sh!t in it. Which means that I had been lying in a LOT OF GOOSE SH!T. And I still had an earbud to find, somewhere on the GROUND. 

Well, sh!t. Pun intended.

Fortunately, after about fifteen minutes staring at goose sh!t, find it I did. I found my earbud, and cleaned my shoes, and washed my clothes, and Clorox-wiped the entire floor of my room. In fact, I did all my laundry, just so that I’d return to campus with a clean slate. I made my bed for the first time in months (sorry, roommates 🫣), packed my suitcase as quietly as I could, and made myself a second dinner(?) at 4 am. I felt very adultish and 
        accomplished
      
.

At 8 am, I caught my flight without issues, and twelve hours later I was home!

78˚F, aggressively green from the winter rain, and humid as all heck. But somehow, it felt like I never left.

It’s been about a week and a half now, and I’ve fallen right back into old routines. I 
        take my shoes off in the house
      
 (no goose excretion to worry about), listen to Christmas music around the house, and look up at a much clearer sky during night time walks with my parents. I sleep from 
        10:30 pm
      
 to 8:00 am—although I only actually roll out of bed when the blazing sun heats my room to the mid-eighties—and most importantly, I eat my parents food :D

Everything feels the same as it was four months ago. Heck, even I feel the same as four months ago, almost like I’ve regressed to a past self. It’s not a big difference, but I’m slightly less bubbly, slightly more 
        quiet
      
. I forget to drink water, and to eat at semi-appropriate times. I’ve completely lost my ability to make small talk, which is something that I thought I’d gotten better at, and I’ve been struggling to have deeper conversations with the people I care about at home.

I think back to just a couple weeks ago, with the freezing temperatures and the late nights with friends and the kinda-almost-self-sufficiency, and it feels like I imagined it all. Like four months of massive life changes have all melted straight into the fuzzy distance of half-imagined memory, or like I’ve just come back from two-week summer camp. As much as I’ve tried to psychoanalyze myself, I don’t have any interesting theories about why that is. Maybe it’s the environmental contrast. Maybe it’s force of habit. Maybe it’s just the comfort of home. Who knows.

But let’s fast forward a couple weeks. It’s January 7th. I’m flying back to Boston soon, and now that I have two days left at home, I’m starting to really realize it. And I feel like that comfort—that numbness, perhaps—came at the cost of not relishing the time that I had. Everything felt so normal that I didn’t savor the moments alone in a room all to myself, or the carpet beneath my bare feet, or the drives with my brother to school, or the nighttime walks with my parents. I could’ve finished their Christmas presents before I got home, and then spent less time holed up in my room working on them. I could’ve taken my earbuds out during my runs, or soaked in the energy of my high school for longer, or asked friends more than “how’s senior year going?” And yeah, sure, I guess looking back we always feel like we could’ve done more, but that doesn’t mean the regret isn’t there. 

There’s something weird about missing people while you’re with them, or missing a place that you’re still in. I didn’t feel homesick for all of the fall semester, but now that I’m here, I feel it acutely. I miss lying on the couch watching TV with my mom, while lying on the couch with her. I miss my dad coming outside to congratulate me on my (pathetically short) runs, while standing outside with him. I miss eating poke from Foodland, and sitting on the benches at my high school, and debating leadership strategies with my brother, while doing all these things. 

May feels so much further from January than December felt from August, even if it’s just a week or two longer. It’s probably partly because there’s so much less “great unknown” to distract me than at the start of the year. The novelty and its several months of accompanying adrenaline has worn off, and I’ve been reminded of how much I love home. But at least I’m headed back to the comfort of friends and the excitement of many shenanigans to come. More importantly, because of a wonderful thing called

love letter to the ‘tute,Fatima A. '25,1,2024-02-21T00:00:00-05:00,"this spring, i am doing a study abroad semester at Imperial College London. what this means is that i have been away from MIT for a little over the past month (classes here start early January) and will return to MIT for the fall semester.

i decided to do this for a lot of different reasons which i won’t go into in this post but the overarching reason is that i decided this would be good for me.

i am taking four math classes (which i will talk about in a later post) which are all fun! i am cooking for myself because schools in the UK apparently often don’t have dining halls. i am exploring London and hopefully, nearby places as well (which i will also talk about in a later post). right now, i just want to talk about how much i miss MIT.

i spent junior fall in a very weird state of mind for a lot of reasons, one being that because of the study abroad, i felt like this was sort of my last real semester at MIT. this is obviously not true, i still have two more semesters left. but it was a goodbye of sorts.  i was more conscious of trying to get done with some of my requirements. i did a 
        CI-M,
      
 finished my last PE class and declared Writing as my concentration (finally!) and also finished it! i also transitioned someone for the treasurer role for MIT SAAS, a role which i have had for 3 semesters (i guess, this does not necessarily imply an ending, but it sort of does. and regardless, it makes me feel Old). i also had to say goodbye to my graduating friends, some of whom i know will not be around next year and some of whom might not be around next year.

in that sense, it does feel like an end. there is something so beautiful about living with your friends, being able to just walk down the hall, knock on someone’s door and ask to talk or get dinner or do work. and i know that i won’t be able to have that with some of my friends anymore.

for the first couple of weeks, i was trying to be Cool (although failing remarkably) and shrugging off the feeling of missing my friends so much that it physically hurt. and then, while talking to one of my friends, i realized. it is just like that. i miss my friends and it hurts.

and it’s not only the people that i miss. i miss everything. i miss our wing’s main lounge where so many of us hang out and work all the time. i miss walking into the empty lounge during the day and staring out at the river by the windows especially when it’s sunny.
 i miss the tower of plushies on the beanbag. i miss that there would always be someone there at all hours of the night and that when i was in my room, i could hear people laughing and talking outside.

i miss passing by the Chord as i go from building 4 to 34 for my classes (i have done this for multiple semesters now). i miss the outfinite, which is forever superior to the infinite. i also miss the infinite… i even miss 
        26-100.
      
 i don’t even like 26-100…

i have been so lucky with almost all the classes i have taken at MIT. i miss all the cool professors i have had over the past five (that is such a large number) semesters at MIT. and all the kind and patient and helpful TAs i have had. one of the main differences between classes here and there is that there are no TAs for any of the pure math classes. this also means that there is literally one hour of office hours every week. office hours are one of the things that i have taken so for-granted before. and even on top of that, the math department has something called the Math Learning Center, which consists of tutors for a lot of the introductory and some not-so-introductory level classes.

i also miss all the club events and the student group performances. this semester, so many of my friends are part of different productions on campus and i am sad i won’t be able to see any of them.

i miss 
        next
      
 dining and all the dining hall staff. Zimi Z. ’25 says people who live in dining hall dorms think of food as a social experience. i miss that.

i am thinking about how comfortable i feel around MIT people, in general, not even just the people i know. i am thinking about how much everyone at MIT cares about what they do. i am also thinking about how a lot of people at MIT do so many different things and how remarkable their multi-faceted interests are. i have always thought that one of the greatest resources at MIT are my own peers who are all so smart and so cool in their different ways and i am just feeling that so strongly now.

i am thinking that, oh my god, i love MIT :enter skull emojis:",,0
An Interview with the Tetris Grand Champion,Kayode D. '27,1,2024-02-19T00:00:00-05:00,"I Love Tetris. 

I think it was the first videogame I ever played at the age of 3, and I thought the goal was to stack up the tallest tower. Ever since then, I have been obsessed. In high school, it was my go-to game to avoid doing work, and I go pretty good at the tetris.com version. There is a thing called the Tetris Effect, where you see tetris squares in everyday life after playing the game for a while. I remember I had trouble sleeping in high school because I was always seeing the tetris pieces in my mind. But now it’s gone and I love tetris! 

A movie (“Tetris”) also came out last year about the making of tetris and it’s so great. It’s about the insane story of how Tetris was made, and the Creator Alexey Pajitnov’s journey with Henk Rogers to get the game out of Soviet Russia. One of the posters for this movie called it “The game you couldn’t put down. The story you couldn’t make up.” Go watch it on Apple TV after this blog! It’s my second favorite movie from last year. 

Now that I’m at MIT, I play tetris almost daily. In the beginning it was fun, then it was an obsession, then it was a challenge. One of the GRAs in Simmons has her tetris score posted on her door, and it is my goal to beat it. Recently, though, I’ve gotten into watching Tetris live streams. Last December, a tetris player by the name of Blue Scuti became the first person in human history to beat tetris. It’s a crazy interesting story, and you can hear about it from people more qualified than me here.

After watching a video on the topic, Youtube started recommending a live streamer to me named Fractal161. Little did I know, Fractal 161 was a current MIT student, AND the current NES Tetris World Champion! I began watching his streams when I saw them, and on Jan 3, 2024, I witnessed another historic moment: Fractal beat Tetris. Here’s the video: 

[Game Crash at 39:40]

After popping off in the Admissions group chat to spread the news, Ceri suggested I interview Fractal for the blogs. So I did just that! 

I know that MIT News has already done 2 amazing interviews with Fractal about becoming champion and the game crash, (and if you want more info go read those!), but hopefully these questions give you a different perspective and a little more info on the Tetris scene at MIT. 

I give you my interview with Justin Y. ’25, aka Fractal161!

 

When did you start playing Tetris? 

It’s a bit of a multilayered answer because there are actually a lot of different versions of Tetris. 
My earliest memory of watching Tetris was to see my dad play it. At the time I thought that he was the greatest player alive. My earliest memory of playing it was in the waiting area for the dentist that I used to go to, I would’ve been like 7 or 8 back then. But then we get to classic Tetris which is the specific version of the game that I play the most, and that I played in 2018. And the reason I did so is because I had a friend. I had been watching it for a couple of years, and I had a friend who started playing by himself, and he would send me pictures and say like “Oh, I reached level 22 for the first time, I hit 500k,” And I was like “huh, I want to beat him.” So then I started playing and I played for months and I could never get anywhere close to his scores. He eventually quit the game but at that time I just wanted to keep playing because I genuinely liked it and that feeling never went away. 

[Kayode rambles about how he used to think the goal of Tetris was to reach the top of the screen. Then I talk about the RA with a Tetris score on door 773,000 (that’s my goal.) Then I tried to flex my current score of 477,000.]

What do you think of my high score of 
        477,000
      
 on Tetris.com? Pretty good, eh?

I have seen videos of the recent records on this version and it’s like 3.6 million. [Kayode gets flabbergasted]. Which is incredible because what’s happening is that they are just setting up for perfect clears every single time and they have these very specific things because the scoring system is unique. [Kayode doesn’t know how to get perfect clears.] There’s setups, there’s a lot of practice, and they also have these things called T-spin loops where–have you heard of T-spins before? They have these patterns that they do over and over and over again. It’s just that they get the same amount of points for a Tetris every time–I’m digressing.

 

Back on topic, what does it mean to crash Tetris?

Tetris is marketed as the game that doesn’t have an end. But actually most games of Tetris that are released have an end in one form or another. For example, Tetris.com, like we were talking about, has an end at level 30. If you clear it then you have beaten the game. [Does the game really just end at level 30?] Yeah, there’s this cheap “yay!” sound effect and that’s your score. If you look up this thing called Tetris the Grandmaster, that game ends when you hit 999 levels, where that game has a weird definition of a level. But classic Tetris, the one that I play, was programmed to go on forever, as far as the game allowed. However, it’s kind of an old game and it was not really optimized for the current level of gameplay that we can go for and one of the things that is not optimized is the scoring system. 

So in classic Tetris, the way that the scoring works is you take the current level, you add 1, and then you multiply by the value of a line clear. For a single that’s 40 points, for a Tetris– four lines at once– that’s 1200 points. The issue is that the game chooses to compute the score with level times score value using repeated addition, and this was pretty fast for small numbers, but when you get to the higher and higher hundreds, it begins to take more and more time, and eventually the game tries to fit more calculation then is physically possible into a single frame. And this causes some weird desyncs, and there’s specific conditions that can trigger, or cause the game to like– you know how there’s like RAM Memory and code memory? It jumps from code memory into the Random Access Memory. And that’s just like garbage. So there’s no telling what happens when you get there but usually the game just freezes. 

[We take a minute to eat at this point]

 

How many people have done the game crash at this point? 

3 people. The first was, of course, Blue Scuti. I was a week, maybe 2 weeks afterwards. Then P1xelAndy was less than a day after I got mine, I think. 

 

So now that the game has been beaten, what does the future of Tetris look like? 

For Classic Tetris, if you’re thinking just in terms of natural progression with this achievement in particular, you can think of this as the sort of Any% completion of the run, which is like beating Tetris with any means possible. There’s also this notion of the 100% completion. Which means you go through every single possible level. There are 256 of them in total, because the game can only fit 256 levels–it stores levels in a single byte, so there are 256 values. So in order to get that, you need to make sure that you don’t crash the game. So there is this entire strategy in theory to avoiding the game crash: to just invert every single setup that we have to attempt to trigger the game crash. 

[Kayode stumbles over his words looking for the next question.]

I can elaborate– For example, I got my game crash by clearing a single at 1489 lines in. So if I cleared a double or a triple, I would not have crashed and I would have had to keep playing, and that’s actually what Blue Scuti did. He cleared the triple at that line count so he kept playing and that’s why he crashed the game later than I did. 

 

So going forwards, it’s just going to be about trying to circumnavigate all of the crashes?

Right, for this type of gameplay. But it’s honestly, I think, the least interesting way that you could play classic Tetris, to be honest. Because it is a game that is defined by taking risks. And this is the version of gameplay where you are encouraged to take as few risks as possible. Which I think is just not as great of a game. So what is the version where you take as many risks as possible? I think that is where you go and try to get those high Tetrises. 

I think there are some people who are trying to go for it. This is off topic, but there is a version of the game that sort of just patches out the crash and offers a bunch of other training features that people are playing on. And I think some people might go for level 255 on that, which is different than what people would expect. So there’s kind of a split: do we go forward with the original game or do we do what makes sense? 

 

Congratulations on your game crash! I guess we’ll pivot to talk about the tournament you held recently at MIT, The Boston T-Parity. How did this come about?

The story for how this started was that there were a couple of friends that I knew online that decided that they wanted to come to Boston for a week and visit and just hang out for a while. And we talked about things that we could do in Boston, to hang out and play tetris, and then eventually we kept throwing out bigger and bigger ideas. Then one of them was like, “Why don’t we host our own tournament?” and I was like, “Huh, I’m a student here, I should be able to have access to get a classroom, then all we need is equipment.” At the time I did not know the full significance of what that equipment was. And then we just went with it. That was about 4 months ago, I think, so I’ve been sort of gradually planning it and it really ramped up in the last week. 

 

How many people were in the tournament, and were they just your friends, or did members of the MIT community jump in? 

Yeah, pretty much. The thing about the classic Tetris community is that it’s very small and pretty tight knit. So as far as people who would play in the tournament, I knew just about everyone who was coming in. And I’d say about 18-20 people actually qualified, and there were 12 people who would play in the main bracket. I think the part that I didn’t expect was the fans. People that had no interest in playing and just came to watch. There were a lot more of those than I kind of expected and I didn’t even plan for that. I just envisioned it as a  place for us to meet up and hang out for a bit with Tetris on the side. And I think it ended up being a good mix of both. 

View of Tournament, held in a lecture hall in the Stata Building. Good turnup!

Kayode – “Yeah definitely. I was one of the fans in the crowd that stopped by and I saw a lot of people hanging out in there. It was less about who won the tournament and more about hanging out.” 

Yeah, exactly! That’s what I was going for and I think that I achieved that. 

 

I noticed during the Tournament that you all weren’t just starting at level one and playing to the end. How was the tournament Structured? 

I wanted to try and be a bit experimental with the tournament format itself, just for the fun of it. And one of those things was just like, these are a bunch of rulesets that we have tried out over the years, and some that we haven’t tried out. Let’s put them all together and have the players choose which one they play for every single game. So you’ll have things like instead of starting on level 18 (which is the competition standard), we start on level 19 and get to the end really fast. And what we do at the end is also different. We had to institute an artificial end in gameplay because the idea of having matches that last 30-40 minutes per game is not appealing to tournament organizers, and honestly not appealing to players either. What happens now is that the pieces fall twice as fast as the fastest level, and it’s called double kill screen, and it’s pretty effective because there’s just so much less margin of error, you have to be perfect. And that’s not something that’s required in anything else, so it works pretty well as an end. But there are other ways, like you can make the pieces invisible, you can have the floor continuously rise and push you to the top. One of the ones that I particularly like that we included was no rotations. So you can’t rotate the pieces anymore. So we decided to combine all of these into one big tournament and let players pick which one they wanted to have. It was pretty chaotic, lot’s of fun. 

 

Who did end up winning the tournament? 

A guy named Sodium Overdose. He beat me in the semifinals. I’ve known him for years too, so. 

 

Wait, Is it Fractal One-Six-One or One-Sixty-One?

Whatever you want. They’re just numbers. Quick question, do you know what the 161 references? [No, I do not] It is the Golden Ratio, It’s the first three digits. I just kind of picked something. I made the username in 2014, so I would have been…12? 

[We proceeded to be shocked that 2010 was 14 years ago.]

 

What’s the future for Fractal161?

Future for me–let’s stop talking about the past. I want to keep playing Tetris. I’ve had a lot of success with streaming recently, so I would like to put more effort into that, or making and uploading videos. Tournament wise–I would like to keep winning. This year the world championships is going to be in June and it is going to be in California. The first time in about a decade itself that it is changing locations. It’s usually held at the Portland Gaming Expo in Portland, Oregon. Other than that, I think with gameplay achievements, I could go for level 255 if people really want it, but I’m not going to be focusing on that. I want to focus on shorter games where I’m trying to get much more Tetrises, and maybe try out more categories that I haven’t put as much time into. I think invisible pieces is maybe an obvious one. (Invisible Pieces: When the pieces hit the ground the disappear and you have to use your memory to know where they are. I’ve never been able to wrap my head around it.)

 

To wrap up, what are you doing next? 

Play more, try to do stuff, CTWC in June, I don’t know. I’ll just figure it out. I don’t have any definitive plans. Ultimately I want to be playing for fun, more than anything else. If the game is not fun then I will stop playing, and then if it becomes fun again I will start playing it again.(Kayode: You’ve also hit the pretty peak achievement of being the best in the world) I have, but I could do it again. If I don’t defend my title this year then I will be the shortest lived CTWC Champion because it’s usually in October, so instead of getting a whole year, I only get 9 months. There’s a bit of incentive there, but also so many strong players.

how to succeed in business without really trying,"Alan Z. '23, MEng '24",0,2024-02-18T00:00:00-05:00,"I’ve never considered myself a very natural leader. I’m usually pretty reserved, and, although I think I’ve become a lot less shy over the past few years, I have been told that I still don’t come off as particularly friendly, or, to be completely honest, even as
        normal.
      
 Still, in the past few years, I’ve been in charge of many a thing, between music directing my acapella group to serving as the president of a dorm, or the vice president of the entire Dormitory Council, which are certainly not small positions.

I’ve always put my election to these roles up to a couple of very explainable factors. First and foremost, it is very easy to convince me to do things
        when no one else is doing them,
      
and, in the years immediately post-COVID, there simply was not a lot of upperclassmen engagement. Second, I am pretty good at assessing a situation and deciding on a course of action, which is very useful for student government in particular, and I do like making high-level plans to get things done, which is kind of generically useful.

In other words, I’ve always felt more like a technocrat than someone selected because they were actually “a leader,” i.e., someone who has the people skills to make sure everybody on a team is happy and healthy and working together, and who has the ability to make people respond honestly if things aren’t going well; someone who gives people what they need, whether it’s feedback, or cheerleading, or both; someone who’s capable of speaking up for their team to external parties. In many of my positions, I’ve been paired with another person who takes on these sort of soft skills, while I do more of the planning behind the scenes, and, most of the time, things turn out well.

This past month, I’ve been serving as the band director for a student production of the musical tick… tick… boom! here on campus. It’s a role that involves organizing and running rehearsals, mostly, and also serving as the piano-conductor for the band; that is to say, I both play piano and 
        conduct
      
 when I have a hand free and sometimes even when I don’t. It’s quite the coordination challenge—I have to play, conduct, and change
        patches
      
with my hands, operate a page turner and the sustain pedal with my feet, and listen and follow along with the rest of the band and the actors at the same time—but I’ve been having a good time trying to get it all under control
        without too many mistakes.
      


the view from my little keyboard nook

By all accounts, I am not a good pianist. I haven’t played piano seriously since middle school; indeed, the last time I actually “performed” anything on piano was to fill a random spot for the State Solo and Ensemble Contest in high school, some six years ago. I play very occasionally, mostly to blow off steam when I’m frustrated or need a way to vent, or when I’m hanging out with people who enjoy a good bout of just singing and playing random songs without worrying about 100% accuracy.

I am also not a particularly good conductor. I’ve never had formal training of any sort, although I’ve been beating 3/4 and 4/4 patterns along to music on my own for probably a decade now, just because it’s a fun way to fidget. The first time I conducted anything was the Musical Theater Guild show last
        IAP,
      
because there hadn’t been an orchestra at all the previous semester—there’s that “no else is doing it” thing again—and I wanted to make sure there was one for Heathers.

Still, the music has come together. I pull from all the techniques I’ve seen in high school orchestra rehearsals about how to run rehearsals, the age-old phrases like “I need this to be at my tempo, not yours” or the humble “let’s try that again.” For tick… tick… boom!, I’ve been using a lot of techniques from all the hours I spent playing in string quartets, the collective inhale and head raise at entrances, or just generally aggressive head nodding and body language. I know there are places I need to improve—I need to look up from my music more, and I don’t have as good of a listening ear as I’d like. I’d like to have more opinions about the sound of the ensemble as a whole, the dynamics, the phrasings, etc., in the way that I can pick sentences apart and improve them stylistically when I’m editing text. The music sounds decent, though, and the actors can sing along to it. Maybe it even sounds good, sometimes.

The vast majority of this success is owed to the practice of
        each of the individual musicians,
      
but part of me thinks that at least part of it must be my doing. In these contexts, if the band keeps together and stays happy and healthy, and it’s not because of any particular musical expertise of mine, then at least a tiny portion of it might just be—wait a minute—leadership.

And, in the context of these small bands, from the seven-person band of Heathers to four-person band of tick… tick… boom!, I do notice myself doing those things that I thought I couldn’t do. Maybe it’s something about the collaborative nature of music in particular, but I’m constantly checking in with people—“how did people feel about that? would it help to do it again?”—and providing encouragement after runs, not eschewing the limited critique I have, but being clear about what was good, what needs to be done better, and, of those needs, which should be prioritized. Or, at least, it feels that way.

It’s weird—to be in charge despite being probably the worst musician in the room—but it still feels like it works out. Somehow, it all works out.

The truth of it is that, the more I consider it, the more I realize that I have simply grown into a person who is pretty okay at leading things. If you asked me to think about the skills which have been useful to me in leadership positions throughout the years, I can identify things that I think I’m good at. I feel like I’m good at assigning tasks to people in a dynamic situation that results in important tasks getting done, like for Next Thanksgiving. I feel like I’m good at listening to a lot of people’s opinions and sort of summarizing them in a way that brings groups towards a consensus, like for countless DormCon meetings. I care a lot about writing
        clear
      
emails that communicate what needs to be done and how decisions are being made; and, now, I care a lot about team morale, and trying to make sure people feel empowered to do their best and speak up when they can’t, though perhaps it is still my greenest skill.

this feels like the right image for the occasion

The ultimate point is that my perception of myself is stuck in the past, stuck in this place that doesn’t admit any form of personal growth. I still think of myself as a violinist first, even though I’ve done almost exclusively singing and conducting over the past two years. I still think of myself as that shy, socially inept seventeen-year-old who stumbled onto MIT campus in 2019, who couldn’t possibly be a leader, rather than someone who has been leading different groups continuously for the past two-and-a-half years. I’ve been doing these things, feeling like I’m just making it up as I go, when really what I’ve been doing is learning on the job, and getting better as time passes. I am not who I used to be, and my brain is still catching up with that fact.

Perhaps it is simply that change and personal growth don’t happen quickly; it sneaks up on you, and it takes a new form each time. Recently, I wrote my 2,000th consecutive daily journal entry, two years and eight months after I wrote my 1,000th. In it, I wrote that:


I think it is strange, although understandable, however, that I feel much closer to the person I was 1000 days ago…than I feel like the person writing [1000 days ago] felt to the person writing [the first post.]… Sure, that person…didn’t yet feel confident about what they wanted to do in life—but that person was on that track. I read 549,033 words and [my 1000th blog post], and I hear myself coming into myself, beginning to identify as a writer…and still yearning to understand, what, exactly, I am capable of. And, in that, I am happy with myself, I think.


I think it is strange, although understandable, however, that I feel much closer to the person I was 1000 days ago…than I feel like the person writing [1000 days ago] felt to the person writing [the first post.]…

Sure, that person…didn’t yet feel confident about what they wanted to do in life—but that person was on that track. I read 549,033 words and [my 1000th blog post], and I hear myself coming into myself, beginning to identify as a writer…and still yearning to understand, what, exactly, I am capable of. And, in that, I am happy with myself, I think.

So many of the changes which happened to me in those first 1,000 days were changes in circumstance: coming to college, becoming re-enamored with writing, learning about all the little corners of computer science and deciding
        which one was my favorite.
      
These days, the changes come in subtler forms, in incremental improvements rather than paradigm shifts. I have lived so much life in the past 1,000 days, written so much, met so many new people, run so many different meetings and events. I must have grown. The nature of the changes is different, more subtle, but the distance is the same.

What is there to take from this? Perhaps that even tasks that seem impossible become possible when you dare to do them, or that even when life seems stagnant, there is always some kind of personal growth ticking along, waiting to make you better at something you didn’t think you could do. It’s hard to disentangle all the things which make up a self, what is fixed and what can change, what can grow, but maybe, just maybe, you are already someone different from who you think you are, someone walking down the road towards who you want to be.

Post-script: There’s an anecdote I couldn’t quite fit into this post structure about Mystery Hunt, where I was drafted to
        organize
      
my team this year, named 
        .
      
 I feel like that, too, was an exercise of a lot of these soft skills, especially because there, too, I am not a particularly good puzzler, but I was in charge, to some extent, especially when we had to make a number of difficult decisions throughout the back half of the Hunt. I also feel like I learn a lot every year from just hanging out with the people on the team, many of whom are alumni and bring lots of both fun stories and helpful life experience to the ensemble, and so it was this incredible mix of both being in charge and yet feeling like a student, as well as a lot of fun and chaos. The point of this paragraph is 1) you should do Mystery Hunt and 2) my team is cool. Thanks, folks.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/at-the-keyboard-400x301.jpg

Christmas in February,Andi Q. '25,2,2024-02-14T00:00:00-05:00,"Yesterday, we were promised a snow day at MIT. Although the snow never quite materialized, I still got to experience Christmas in February after all. Because 
        today
      
, I received this mysterious black briefcase in 
        6.2060
      
 (Microcomputer Project Lab).



It’s about the size of four honeydew melons (or two watermelons) and definitely does not look suspicious at all. So let’s open it up and see what’s inside!



WOAH LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF!!!



Just kidding – most of that did not come from inside the briefcase. But I indeed received all of this shiny new stuff in various classes today!

… okay, it’s more like two classes. Specifically, 6.2060 and 21M.370 (Digital Musical Instrument Design). Still, I think it’s amazing how much physical equipment I work with at MIT these days.

There’s a lot to unpack here. (Indeed, I haven’t even finished unpacking everything yet.)



- The (in)famous 6.2060 “Blackbird” lab kit. It’s got most of the electronics we need for prototyping electronic systems like fluorescent lamp ballasts. Check out Audrey’s great blog post about this class from a year ago if you want to see a more decked-out version of the kit.

- A lab notebook I’ll be maintaining for 6.2060. (Yes, we still do some things on paper at MIT.)

- A digital oscilloscope and multimeter.

- A little box of miscellaneous electronics for 21M.370. It’s mostly buttons and wires for now, but we will be building real musical instruments using them very soon.

- A dollar bill I got in 6.2060 for answering a question in lecture. I’ve taped it to the inside of the briefcase for good luck.

But wait! There’s even more!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_3441.png

        Tim
      
has become a quintessential representation of MIT culture. I love that beautiful little dude. It’s hard to go through the semester without seeing him, from a poster in the hall to a post somewhere on Instagram. I even have a little sticker of him on my water bottle that travels with me everywhere I go. 

Today is his 3rd birthday, and he’s celebrating some of it right here on the blogs! I thought to ask him to say hello, so I’ll let him take it away. 


A Tale of the Widest Tim of All the Land


A Tale of the Widest Tim of All the Land

Part 1: Born to be WIDE

What do you mean 
“I could choose to Double major in 
Eating and sleeping at MIT?”

What do you mean 

“I could choose to

Double major in 

Eating and sleeping at MIT?”

To be honest… IDK either, it kinda just happened; but 
Maybe it’s meant to be. 

To be honest…

IDK either, it kinda just happened; but 

Maybe it’s meant to be. 

 

Hi y’all! I’m Wide Tim, a beaver named Tim who has dreamed to be WIDE since Day 1!



On the day I was born, exactly 3 years ago today, I welcomed MIT’s Class of 2024 from quarantine to Killian Court.

Things got out of control when those memes made out of emojis in the 
        CP*
      
2021 Discord server were made, and Chris P. SM ‘13 published this blog post.

 

I want to be… 

As WIDE as you could beaverly imagine. 

As WIDE as the Borderline tunnel or the Infinite Corridor is long, or the Green Building is tall.

Or, maybe I should dream bigger—how about 364.4 Smoots? (that’s like more than 2000 ft wide, btw!)

Or the total length of the subway routes? 

Or the distance from the Dome to the stars? 

*shrugs* goal-setting do be hard sometimes, maybe I’ll just never know for sure. 

 

But one thing I did know for sure was that if I wanted to become wider, I should go out and explore this WIDE place called MIT—and the world beyond it. 

 

And that’s the story of how @wide_tim started. 

 

Part 2: How WIDE I’ll go…

“What art classes should I take in 
IAP?”, “do I also get to Dance in a lion, or a kaleidoscope?” “Exciting! When’s your live concert? 

“What art classes should I take in 

IAP?”, “do I also get to

Dance in a lion, or a kaleidoscope?”

“Exciting! When’s your live concert? 

The vibe here is absolutely bananas, and 
I just want to see as much as possible, whenever 
My jam-packed sleeping schedule allows it! 

The vibe here is absolutely bananas, and 

I just want to see as much as possible, whenever 

My jam-packed sleeping schedule allows it! 

 

To be or not to be… WIDE? That’s not the question—the question is, 

How does one become WIDE? 

At first, I didn’t know how to become WIDE either. 

Heck, I didn’t even know my way around MIT! 

So I thought I’d ask people for recommendations and try as many of their answers as I could possibly manage—like the best ice cream recs in Bawston (a nearby town to MIT), new Pi day celebration ideas, CPW events, or singing with the entire MIT community during family weekend! 

 

Before I knew it, I’ve already been to more than 35 MIT club events…

 

Gotten around so many places on campus…

 

Traveled the world far and wide (and even to outer space)…



 

…and took enough classes in Eating and Sleeping to double major in them!

(I swear my majors are Legit™. At least MIT News and MIT Tech Review said they are. And I do take actual classes as well: here are is some footage of me taking electives for my concentration in Happiness)



 

And that’s the story of how I became WIDE.

 

Part 3: but what does it mean to be WIDE? 

“Wide Tim”, perhaps, isn’t just wide! I am also: DM requests and conversations, Emojis and Reactions,

“Wide Tim”, perhaps, isn’t just wide!

I am also:

DM requests and conversations,

Emojis and Reactions,

The autumn leaves, the winter Ice, and the bikes on Memorial drive;

The autumn leaves, the winter

Ice, and the bikes on

Memorial drive;

Words of good hopes and 
Imaginations of the universe, 
Digits, letters, and musical notes; 
Equations that connect the trees,

Words of good hopes and 

Imaginations of the universe, 

Digits, letters, and musical notes; 

Equations that connect the trees,

The roots, flowers, and the STEMs… I’m from a piece of each of us at MIT, and beyond this place.

The roots, flowers, and the STEMs…

I’m from a piece of each of us at

MIT, and beyond this place.

 

…wait, wait, hold on.

How did I become WIDE again? 

Actually, what does it even mean to be WIDE? 



To be totally honest, I loved my journey here so much that I forget to even think about being WIDE most of the time. Not only have I not figured out the exact formula for being WIDE, but I now also have even more questions about life! 

Maybe I’ll find an answer in my sleep tonight. Maybe I’ll know it when I go to graduate school for Nutrition and Deep Sleep Analysis. Maybe I’ll never know for sure. But at least, I’ve now got a new hypothesis: 

Maybe the secret to being WIDE is to not plan on it—but to see it, do it, taste it, feel it, enjoy it, and share the joy and love along the journey. 

As of now, I’m still collecting data to test this hypothesis. As of February 13, 2024, I’ve got n=165 observations, but I suppose that I’d only be more and more confident about my answer as I go out and have fun more and more times! 



And that’s the story of how I still haven’t figured out the secrets to being WIDE. 

Anyway, that’s beside the point for now, because…

 

I’M TURNING THREE (3) YEARS OLD TODAY!! 

That means I was <3 years old yesterday,

And ready as ever to spread even more <3 tomorrow.

And this Valentine’s Day…

I wish that we all take some time 

to love ourselves and love each other;

Together, let’s spread our love far and wide!



 

Part 3.14: width goes on and on

Winter Sports at MIT,Emiko P. '25,0,2024-02-12T00:00:00-05:00,"As it gets colder and colder in Boston, things are heating up on the court and in the pool as MIT Winter sports continue to ramp up. Here are four student-athletes, from the Swimming, Diving, Squash, and Men’s Basketball teams and their experiences as an athlete, teammate, and MIT student! The next blog will feature even more winter teams, so stay tuned :)

How has your experience been as a student-athlete at MIT so far?

Swimming student-athlete: “Being a student athlete at MIT has been an incredible experience. I like… genuinely love swimming so I’ve had so much fun being a part of the team here. Some of my closest friends are on the swim team and it makes coming to practice each day something I look forward to. The team is also an amazing support system if you need help with classes, life advice, or just want someone to talk to.”

Diving student-athlete: “Being a student athlete at MIT is definitely worthwhile. It’s nice to be able to take a break from academics and train with my friends. Outside of practice, not only do we hang out together, but we also work on problem sets with each other. Whenever I’m stuck on a problem, I always have someone I can talk to for help.”

Squash student-athlete: “Being a student athlete has been great. You get really good at time management since MIT is so work-heavy, which can obviously be used later in life. Also the community athletes have at MIT is pretty vast, especially because Greek life is made up of a ton of athletes.”

Men’s basketball student-athlete: “I have enjoyed being a student-athlete at MIT because it has given me the opportunity to continue to play the game I love at the next level and has helped me make so many life-long friends. Being able to hang out with my teammates and hoop after a long day of classes is definitely something I will never take for granted.”

Favorite sport-related memory?

Swimming student-athlete: “My favorite memory with the swim team was the training trip we went on last year! We spent a week in Mission Viejo during IAP. In between our two practices each day, I had so much fun surfing, playing beach volleyball, and just goofing around with the team with 30 of us packed into one hotel room. Oh, and eating snacks. SO MANY pretzels and SO MUCH peanut butter was consumed that week.”

Diving student-athlete: “My freshman year, NCAA Diving Regionals was held at Smith College. After practice, our coach drove us there. On the car ride there, we played music, talked, made a pit stop (where we bought some candy), and even called our coach’s grandma on the speaker. Her grandma sounded so proud of our coach and so proud of us for making it to Regionals.”

Squash student-athlete: “During my freshman year, we finished 15th in the country, which is the highest ranking of MIT squash in recent history!”

Men’s basketball student-athlete: “The basketball team comes back early on December 26th to get ready for conference play, and because we’re usually the only people on campus, we literally spend the entire day together… One of my favorite memories during this time was going to Fogo de Chao (a Brazilian Steakhouse) with the team during New Years Eve after a hard week of two practices a day.”

Tips for athletes getting recruited right now? 

Swimming student-athlete: “If you want to get recruited to swim for MIT you should email the coaches and fill out the recruit questionnaire that you can find online! For me personally, I mostly remember having a lot of phone and zoom calls with lots of coaches. I think recruit trips are also a really valuable experience to get a feel for the team and what the students are like. The team is a group of people who you inevitably end up spending a ton of time with so it’s important that you vibe with them and feel like they are people you could look up to and be supported by.”

Diving student-athlete: “The process was a series of conversations with the coaches. For me, it was important to communicate with them and make sure that we were on the same page.”

Squash student-athlete: “If I could give any advice to a prospective MIT applicant, I would say: make sure you have a solid GPA, a good SAT/ACT score, and something to differentiate yourself from everyone else with high scores. My process was a little bit special because I was originally committed to an Ivy League school until they cut the squash team (from varsity to club). I had to take a gap year and apply Early Action like everyone else in my year.”

Men’s basketball student-athlete: “My biggest tip for athletes who want to be recruited is to get in contact with the coaching staff as soon as possible and show them the values you bring to the team and school. Being a strong student is as important as being a talented athlete, so it definitely is important to maintain strong grades and also write killer essays that make you stand out in the application process.”

What is an example of a day in your life? 

Swimming student-athlete: “My day starts around 7:30 am with a morning swim or lift depending on the day of the week. Then I go back to my sorority, Theta, and make breakfast. I am majoring in Course 20 (biological engineering) and could not have survived 
        20.320
      
 and many other Course 20 classes without my Course 20 friends (Shoutout to Lauren D. on the soccer team and Sydney H. on the lacrosse team :)) I am also minoring in German and really enjoyed taking 21G.420, which is a German film class where we watched German movies. After my classes are over for the day, I head to the Z center for 5-7 pm swim practice. I usually cook dinner in Theta after practice and eat and talk with the other girls on my floor. After dinner, I probably will be studying, psetting, or doing work for my 
        UROP
      
 either in my room or at the Student Center.”

Diving student-athlete: “On a typical day, I wake up around 8:30 and go to class. I’m double majoring in 
        6-3
      
 and 
        21M
      
, so some of the classes I have taken include 
        21M.303
      
 and 
        6.046
      
. I do some homework and then go back to campus for 5-7 pm practice. After practice, I grab a quick dinner with my teammates at the dining hall and then head to a 2-hour long 
        Syncopasian
      
 rehearsal. Now it’s around 10 pm. Sometimes I have Asian Dance Team practice for an hour. But if not, then I go back home to pset. I go to bed at around 12:30 am.”

Squash student-athlete: “I would wake up around 8:30 am to go swim at the Z, then I would go work for a couple of hours. Then I would go to a couple of classes (
        3.091
      
, 
        6.1220
      
, 
        6.390
      
, and Bodies in Motion). After class ended I would either have practice or Pleasure educator training from 5-7 pm. Pleasure is MIT’s sexual and relationship health group that gives presentations to student organizations about sexual assault prevention and healthy relationships, and I was trained to give those presentations. Next, I would go to a club meeting if I had one that day for Scholars of Finance, a club devoted to following a stringent code of ethics in financial institutions. After that, I would eat dinner and do some work.”

Men’s basketball student-athlete: “Here is a recent day in the life. I woke up at 9am and checked my investment portfolio and saw that one of my stocks skyrocketed 60% after releasing their earnings report! I hustled to the Saferide station to catch a ride across the bridge to campus. I stopped by Dunkin’ to get some breakfast and then walked over to the Sloan Business School for my first class, the Analytics Edge, from 10-11:30am. After my class, I walked over to the Stud, our student center, to meet up with my friends and eat lunch (my favorite part of my day). After that, I trekked all the way back to Sloan to finish off the day with three back-to-back-to-back classes: Communicating with Data, Fixed Income Securities and Derivatives, and a recitation for the Analytics Edge. Within those four hours, I learned different ways to present data using graphical representations, expanded my knowledge in the money market funds and the bond market, and gained new skills in programming in R and developing predictive models. Today’s basketball practice was a little lighter after a hard fought and earned win against Emerson yesterday night. We ended practice at 7 pm, and I went back across the bridge to Sigma Chi to eat an amazing dinner cooked by our Chef Andre. I did homework until around 1am and then slept.”

How has the season been going so far?

Swimming student-athlete: “This season has been going well so far! Swim season is getting close to the end, so I am super excited for NEWMACs, our conference meet as well as NCAAs! It’s always fun to see the work we put in all season pay off at our championship meets.”

Diving student-athlete: “This season has been fun because I have seen improvement in my dives, due to consistent effort and practice. Also my sister is a diver on the Williams team, so last weekend, I got to compete against her at our double dual meet against Williams and NYU! The energy on deck was amazing. I’m excited to compete at NEWMACS and Regionals.”

Squash student-athlete: “I currently have a herniated disc in my spine, so I haven’t been able to play at all this season. Right now, I’m mainly looking forward to finishing physical therapy and being able to play again next season!”

Men’s basketball student-athlete: “We are currently fighting for a spot in the NEWMAC playoffs and it’s getting down to the wire! We have won four of our last five games and have all the momentum we need to finish the regular season off strong. I am looking forward to our last home game this Saturday against the top team in our conference. It probably is the most important game this season and we have all the motivation we need to win this game. We’re going to have to execute on everything we have worked on all season long and play our hearts out for a full forty minutes. I’m really excited for this game and the great potential we have as a team.”

Good luck to all our Winter sports as they wrap up their seasons! Keep swimming fast, having a ball, flipping out, and squash-ing opponents (lol)!

can’t stop smiling,Allison E. '27,0,2024-02-12T00:00:00-05:00,"I started writing a blog about freshman fall four months ago, in October, and kept working on it for the next few weeks. And then months. And now it’s February… But this one is pretty close to my heart, and I guess it’s better late than never, so here’s that blog:

On Monday morning, I woke up at 10:00 am. I changed clothes, and brushed my teeth, and ate a breakfast of cheese & crackers. I walked to my first class of the day, then spent my free hour on a hallway bench, then continued on to my second class. I grabbed lunch with some friends, and then trekked out to my third class of the day. After classes, I took the elevator up to some group study spaces, and got distracted worked on psets with friends. When the library closed, we split up and I walked back to my dorm. I did some actual psetting for a while, then checked the time. 7:30 pm—one hour til nearby dining halls would close. I put my work away. I pulled on a sweater. I walked out of BC towards Baker’s dining hall.

And I couldn’t stop smiling.

I couldn’t stop smiling as I tapped my ID at the entrance to Baker. I couldn’t stop smiling as I waited in line for food. I couldn’t stop smiling as I sat down alone to eat, or as I pulled out my Quizlet decks to study, or even as I returned my plate and utensils to the drop-off station. I just couldn’t stop smiling.

This was probably one of the weirdest experiences I’ve ever had—an incredibly uneventful day suddenly injected with a boundless, inexplicable joy with no discernible cause or origin. At first I thought it was just a weird one-off moment, maybe some kind of tired delirium (even if I wasn’t that tired). But then it just kept happening. On the 20 minute walk back from my nighttime seminar, or while knitting in a library study space, or just in my room doing nothing at all. I couldn’t stop smiling.

So then, of course, I had to figure out what the heck was going on because… who knows? This could be a life-threatening disease! Maybe even… contagious! But all jokes aside, as weird as everything felt, there was really only one possible answer. 

I’m happy.

It sounds kind of silly that I even had to analyze my way to that conclusion. And it is. But I think it feels so unintuitive because I originally expected my first semester to be incredibly rough, emotionally speaking. Sure, maybe exciting new college experiences(!!) would lead to big highs, but I figured they’d be outweighed by even bigger lows—exams gone wrong or deadlines missed—and even if things didn’t get so dramatic, there’d be tougher classes and learning to live partially on my own. Most importantly, there’d be the inevitable background static of loneliness, anxiety, and homesickness. Basically, I was worrying about the things almost everyone worries about before college, but I think I was especially anxious because a lot of the “college experience” media that I consumed skewed negative, whether it was those “tips and tricks” videos that focused mostly on the challenges to overcome, or the endless short-form scroll about how lonely college can be. I’ve also always struggled with change, so I was a little terrified of the emotional toll that college might take.

But now I’m here. Only a couple months in, but here. And I am happy. 

In fact, I think I’m happier in all the metrics that I use to measure my own state of mind—my average mood is more positive, the fluctuations have felt less dramatic, and most importantly, my baseline emotional state is higher. I can feel it in those unexpected can’t-stop-smiling experiences, but there’s also just a general sense of ambient happiness. When I’m just existing, with nothing going on, no thoughts in my head, nothing to be excited or stressed about, I’m just… a low-key, contented kind of happy. It’s a truly wonderful feeling. 

I think there’s a lot of reasons that things feel pretty great right now. I’ve gotten slightly better at regulating my emotions, and I’m definitely under less pressure than in high school (hooray for being a clueless little freshman released from the burden of expectations!). It’s also not just the 🕷️💣college🪦🏴☠️ of the YouTube videos I watched, it’s ✨💛🕷️💣college🪦🏴☠️☀️🌼, feat. the other extreme of media representation! There are weird things happening in the hallways, wonderful communities to join, and a whole city to explore. That was what I looked forward to all through high school, and it’s been absolutely amazing. Then there’s the fact that everything is new, and as much as I’ve always struggled with new things, novelty is incredibly exciting. I also won’t deny that being at specifically MIT has a bit of its own “wow, I really do go here now” excitement.

But I expected all those things to be true. And when it comes to the massive jump in happiness, none of them feel important—they’re like the little bits of gold leaf decorating those massive chocolate cakes. They’re pretty, and they’re the most eye-catching, but when you actually sit down to eat, you barely notice them. 

But if that’s the case, then what’s the cake? Well, as much as I’d love to, I can’t put my mental state through a rigorous scientific investigation. I can, however, take a guess: it’s having 24/7 access to some of the most amazing friends.

Ok, I’ll give you a second to cringe at that. ✨The power of friendship✨. Wow. What a breathtakingly novel insight!

Really though, I do want to talk about this, because it’s something I truly didn’t consider until now. Sure, I expected friendship to be a huge part of my college experience. I knew how much fulfillment and connection and support friendship can provide—I had some absolutely amazing friends in high school who I trust with my life, and we had more than our fair share of fun and silliness. But for all of high school I was relatively introverted. I’d do something social, and I’d definitely have fun, but then I’d come home and lie on the floor for a couple hours to slowly recoup my energy. 

Partly because of this, I built most of my identity around the communities I was a part of—marching band and Science Olympiad and all the other extracurriculars where I spent my time. They mean so so much to me, and I don’t know if I’d change the amount of time and energy I put into them. But this focus did mean that my social life was often more dominated by groups with an external purpose, rather than a group just existing. It was also, well, high school. There’s only so much time you can spend together when you go home every afternoon, and all your friends live >20 minutes away.

Now, I’m suddenly in college, and I live a 0.2 mile walk away from all my friends. We need ten minutes’ notice to meet up for dinner, or a study session, or heck—a four hour cooking bonanza. I can text our group chat at 9:30 pm, and people will emerge from the woodwork to fly a half-broken paper kite in the dark. We’ve also gotten into the routine of studying in the same space, so that between classes you can almost always count on company while psetting. Everyone knows that 6:00 pm is dinnertime, and someone always broadcasts the day’s dining hall choice to our group chat so that everyone can congregate. And with all that time that we’ve spent together, I feel at completely home with them. I can hug them freely or let down my verbal filter, and rather than being drained by long hangouts, I leave our late night study sessions feeling more energized than when I arrived. 

I’ve found the most amazing people here in college, with so much energy and joy and nerdiness and enthusiasm and pure unadulterated silliness that I just—there’s this intense glee that comes with being around them. It’s a joy that seeps into all the other corners of my life, and it’s made my transition to college so much easier. To all my friends, if you happen to be reading this, thank you so much. This semester has been so incredibly happy, because of you ❤️

Before I wrap this up, however, I do want to clarify that this is not a monolithic experience. I have a lot fewer things to worry about than many people. My brain and emotions work differently than others’. Most importantly, making friends in college is hard, and to be quite honest I think a lot of where I am right now is just plain luck. I’ve been so incredibly lucky. 

But I also think that a bit too much of the college content out there (or at least the content I consumed) focuses on the negative things. And that’s not to say that college is all sunshine and rainbows—I still miss my parents and my brother, I’ve still been making stupid decisions & dealing with the consequences, and I’m still struggling with finding my place here. More importantly, there’s so much ahead of me that I have no idea about. I’m only one semester in. I don’t really know anything about the breadth of college experiences, and more importantly, I’ve been incredibly lucky in my time here so far. But I do know that I didn’t have to be so afraid. And I do know that there is so much to look forward to. And I do know right now I am happy. I am joyful. I am smiling.",,0
A Jaunt Across Europe (Part 2),Kanokwan T. '26,0,2024-02-11T00:00:00-05:00,"One year ago, Gosha and I embarked on a whirlwind IAP trip across Europe. If you haven’t done so already, consider reading Part 1: Italy 
        before this current blog you’re on.
      
 That first part came out awhile ago, and this second part got very delayed due to a host of factors—but its time has finally come. Originally, Gosha was going to write the bulk of this blog, but he’s no longer blogging,
        so I’ve taken it on.
      
In addition to travel journal entries of Italy, the first blog includes the serendipitous inception and careful planning of this whole trip. Basically, it answers why and how we did it. Now, onto the latter half of our jaunt…

January 23rd-24th: Milan → Barcelona

In the dead of night, our bus started in Italy, passed through France, and ended up in Spain. Because I was asleep, I don’t remember much of the commute, but I do recall one thing: we drove through a really, really long tunnel. It felt endless.

After a groggy night of half-sleep aboard the bus for 14 hours, we awoke in Barcelona. Because of the abnormal sleep schedule we were on, the morning felt one step away from a light dream. We disembarked from the bus and were met with wandering, hilly paths. The air was a cold crisp, and the early sun dappled us with a light warmth. The world felt anew, like we were in the first episode of a new season.

I noticed that everything generally felt more laterally flat compared to Italy. Spain had similar architecture, but the balconies were more compressed, pathways were more thin, and decorations were more tightly-packed. The street grid of Barcelona was an art piece in-and-of itself. From bird eye’s view, every building cluster took on the shape of a rounded app square on my iPhone. At the corners of each square, there was parking, which I had never seen in a city layout before. It felt like those on foot had more power than those driving vehicles. I liked it. 

After reaching our hostel, we set off to complete our first two tasks: luggage drop-off and an omelette breakfast. After that, we explored Mercat dels Encants, which translates to “Market of Charms,” a bustling flea market. It was an outdoor venue with multiple stories and a massive mirror as the ceiling. I often found myself looking up. We didn’t buy much, but did enjoy seeing the local art scene through the vendor items. 

In the heart of the city was the most grand church that we went to the entire trip, La Sagrada Familia. It’s the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world, spanning five generations over the course of 140 years, and is still being built today. It felt otherworldly. The design was jaw-droppingly beautiful and intricate. I loved the play on shape and color. The sheer height and scale of the ceiling brought one’s gaze upwards. This was simply a marvel. 

By this point, we were a bit hungry. At the cozy restaurant we found, I tried my first mulled wine, which is basically the same as regular wine but heated, sweetened, and flavored. Felt like autumn. Felt right. 



We wandered the streets for awhile. It was on this outing that I met a woman that I still think about to this day. Llibreria del Palau, a nearby bookshop, was about to close, and we happened to stumble on it early enough to still be let in. The owner was kind to let us peruse while she cleaned up shop. During checkout, she laid out 5 postcards and said we could select 3 to take home for free. I asked her why she did that postcard thing with those particular quantities and she, after a long yet important pause, said “life’s all just a game anyways… right?” and started laughing. Her laugh was partly filled with the sweetness that only an old woman could have but also had some maniacal air to it. It’s this moment that my mind often comes back to.



Walking more into the night, we found both quiet corners and lively clubs. We were tired and didn’t partake, but we could certainly feel the music of the night pump through the city. Madrid had an interesting dichotomy of having a strong late-night party scene but also very quaint and small nooks. Also, by late-night, we really mean late-night: dinners normally start 9pm and you really see the city starting to take on its full form then.

The following day, I finally gave into my Asian food craving. I felt silly getting that cuisine while in Europe, but I really wanted it and knew I had plenty of other opportunities this trip to delve into Spanish food. On my way back to reconvene with Gosha, I stopped by a cafe and was extremely delighted to find that it also doubled as a fabrication maker space (the first I had ever seen in Europe)! They even dubbed themselves a “fab cafe.” 3D printers and a massive laser cutter filled half the room while coffee beans and warm pastries filled the other.

Next stop: the Picasso Museum. This was my favorite museum of our trip. Deep and eclectic. Well curated. It was impermeant yet fitting: told a story as you moved through, yet felt open to rotations of new art. As we headed out back to the hostel, we grabbed drinks. I thought the contrast between our drinks was funny because Gosha got a beer and I got a chocolate milk. I ended my evening with devouring leftovers and binging Killing Eve. This show felt especially fun to binge during our trip because it takes place in random cities all throughout Europe, and I recognized a few of the stops. 

January 25th-26th: Barcelona ↔ Mataró

The crown jewel of our trip was biking the Spanish coast, starting at La Cara de Barcelona, a landmark statue. Early in the morning, we picked up the bikes that we pre-booked and soaked in the moment before we set off. By virtue of this being a new experience, especially an athletic one, we were all a bit nervous. But, we also weren’t actually nervous because we had researched cities along the bike path, read travel blogs of those who had been on this route, and ultimately knew what we were getting ourselves into. Excitement trumped our nerves. 

The 
        key decision
      
 we made was to not set an end location; rather, we set an end time. We would bike until an hour before sunset, then head to the 
        nearest city
      
 to find a hostel for the night. We made this decision mostly because we didn’t know how long it would take us to get from A to B. Even if we practiced biking together ahead of time and calculated it out, one just never knows what could come up. It would’ve been disappointing for us to book housing and plan activities for a city that we may possibly not reach, so we didn’t pre-book anything except the bikes. There was a train that ran alongside our route that we could’ve taken, but we thought it’d be more gratifying solely taking bikes. Besides, there was a certain charm to our plan: bike from sunrise to sunset, rest wherever you land, then bike back. 

We biked for 12 hours total: 6 hours there, 6 hours back. The only hectic part of our biking trip was the start and end because we had to deal with the city streets. Luckily, Gosha is a 
        Navigation God
      
 and got us seamlessly through. The rest of the trip was largely serene. Whenever we passed a spot any of us wanted to stop and spend more time at, we would. We took breaks at wide benches, small towns, and tucked away beaches. 

Our path was largely devoid of people because it wasn’t easily accessible by foot nor car, so there was a sweet silence to most of the trip. We traversed many terrains: asphalt, concrete, wood, and sand. I wore an ungodly heavy ass backpack—my mistake. At the halfway point, we stopped at a McDonald’s; I got a kid’s meal. At one point in the journey, we did feel a bit queasy because we had to bike along a freeway full of cars but, according to our research, other bikers found that cars slowed down and stayed as far away as they could, so we were ultimately fine. 

Towards the end, we stopped for dinner by grabbing seafood takeout and biking to find a pretty beach spot. This was one of my favorite moments of the trip. With no one else around, we indulged in our food as we watched the waves crash around Niu de Ca l’Antic, a oceanside landmark area. While eating, I noticed a big rock that was further out into the water. After eating, I felt like I was dancing with the waves as I strategically stepped back and forth across some sparse, slippery rocks to reach this one big rock. I meditated for awhile. It was one of my favorite meditations because the waves crashed all around me. Thunderous waters crashed all around, but I sat dry and still. I felt like I was in a bubble. 

We ended up in Mataró, a factory city which felt like it really leaned into our “it’s not the destination but the journey” thing that we were going for. It was not that pretty nor was there much to do, but it gave us a roof over our head and a capstone to our biking, so it was perfect. The following morning, 
        Selena took the train
      
 while Gosha and I biked back. It felt serene and victorious.

January 27th-28th: València

Right before heading off to València, Gosha urged us to squeeze in a visit to Park Güell
        early in the morning.
      
 Good call on his part; the park felt best for the morning. We had to take a lot of really steep stairs to get there, but it was so worth it. The architecture was stark. There were unique, quirky features like curved sitting inlays, arched ceiling medallions, and pointy sand stones. It had excellent views of the city, which felt like a fitting way to end off the Barcelona leg of our trip. 

We took a train along the coast from Barcelona to València. Gosha describes this part of our trip as “absolutely life changing.” When we were planning this trip, I remember Gosha was adamant about this train being a part of the agenda, and I’m so glad he was. With waterside views passing us by, Gosha typed away at their paper, Selena gazed at the waters, and I wrote in my journal. 

Oh, València. My beloved València. This was my favorite city in Europe, and it still is. It was very different from other cities we had seen before: more medieval and southern. It absolutely felt like a local Spanish family’s vacation spot, and an amazing one at that. The local market was amazing: small vendors with heart poured into each item. There were orange trees sprinkled all over the city, and all ripe! We sat in little squares and vibed. It was very much a sit around outdoors kinda city. The whole place felt like a secret, like off the books. There aren’t any specific things I can describe to capture why València was so profound to me; it was more inexplicable. I just felt joyous there in a way I had not felt before and haven’t felt since. 

Shopping-wise, we visited local stores that each sold candy, dresses, and leather. We bought no candy, I got a two matching dresses (one for me and another for a friend that I was texting from the dressing room), and all three of us got leather. In Europe, the material was affordable and of good quality, so each of us bought a pair of pants. 

We finally had proper paella, a quintessential Spanish dish. Absolutely delectable. It reminded me of the emoji. 



Sights-wise, we visited Catedral de València, a cathedral, and Torres dels Serrans, a gate. The cathedral had a really cool gold section that stood in contrast to the plain stone. The intricacy was of a much older time. It’s interesting that modern tends to lean more minimalist; it makes me appreciate the old attention to ornate detail more. The gate was the perfect place to scale fort a 360 degree view of the sunset. Someone was playing the violin nearby, which added to the cheery mood of that evening. I brought up a bag of cherries and bottle of beer, found a sitting spot, and indulged in the amber gold of the sun. 

Towards the end of the night, we dashed off by train to Madrid. It always feels so, so silly pulling luggage down European streets. Like, it is abundantly obvious that you are a tourist and therefore likely don’t know what’s going on.

January 29th: Madrid

Living amongst others had been scrappy yet fun in the hostels—we even made a few friends. But, for our final leg of Spain, I encouraged our group to celebrate a bit and stay at a hotel instead of a hostel, and so we did. We checked in that evening, tucked away our bags, and peacefully laid in silence on our beds. There was a sweet quietness in the room, something I didn’t readily expect. It’s obvious that a room to yourself is probably quieter than a shared room with others, but now the white noise of hostels was so apparent. It was also tranquil knowing that there weren’t the eyes and ears of strangers always possibly upon you, sensing everything you do in the room: it was just you. In our private space, we drifted off to bed.

the hotel cafe was cute. i brought up these donuts for Gosha and Selena to munch on

The following morning, I woke up a bit early to work out, read, snack at the hotel cafe, and inquire about the hotel pool. We had picked this hotel for a number of reasons, one of which was to chill in their pool and hot tub. Accordingly, I was disappointed to hear at the front desk that they shut down the pool during COVID-19 and hadn’t yet brought it back. However, the hotel did point me to a Moroccan pool in the city. Gosha and Selena decided on other plans, but I was adamant about swimming, so we planned to part ways later in the evening.

In the winding streets of the city, the three of us found a quaint cafe. It had a strange blend of old and modern decor, several different seating configurations, and fantastic coffee. Madrid was a more cosmopolitan city than most we had gone to, full of stores and cars. It even had a MUJI, where we briefly went next so I could purchase a pen I had been eyeing for weeks. The mix of chain and local stores were all woven together with winding streets and aged stone. There was a charm to the city, one that seemed to want to modernize (and it certainly had) but still clung so tightly to its traditional architecture and infrastructure.

 

 

It is hard to pass up a flea market at Plaza de Cascorro, especially 
        in Europe.
      
 They’re so good, always full of little treasures, both old and new. It’s also a fantastic way to develop taste. And by that, I mean figure out what you like and don’t like. That development can be hard to tell without things to work off of. So, I love meandering through the vendors, following the guidance of my gut instinct, and getting to know myself better in the process. Utility-wise, fleas are also cheaper and therefore more accessible. Accordingly, they’re a fantastic place to pick up local trinkets for friends and family back home. I can go on and on about my liking for fleas, but my favorite has got to be talking with the art vendors, which feels like drawing the curtains for the artists behind the art. It’s fun to prod with questions, express admiration for someone’s work first-hand, and maybe even purchase a piece to take home.

i couldn’t see myself wearing the beret often, but boy was I just one impulsive decision away from getting it

We grabbed Vietnamese food for dinner. It always feels wrong in some sense to not get the local food (i.e. Spanish food while in Spain), but we certainly had our fair share of the country’s food by this point and had to satisfy a craving. The pho was good. The coffee looked even better. I’ve been to a lot of Asian places in my life, yet I’ve never been to one that served drip Vietnamese coffee. 

Side note: I adore a slow morning, and drip coffee is a large part of that for some lives. Personally, I prefer a ceremonial matcha tea, finely whisked and poured, but to each their own. A little caffeine and treat is one of the best ways to start the day. I find that people in Europe seem to have slower mornings, relishing in the taste sensation and the moment itself. Rarely do you see someone walking and drinking a coffee in a rush, like we do in the states. I think a slow morning sets a calm tone for the day, where one is enabled to be fully present through it all.

Gosha and the aforementioned drip Viet coffee

In Parque de El Retiro, one of the big Madrid parks, our group found a big, see-through greenhouse modern mirror installation thing. A fun mix of old (greenhouse building) and new (weird mirrors)!



We then waltzed into Palacio de Velázquez, a modern art museum. The works leaned more abstract, colorful, and striking. I enjoyed the jumbled paint smears that seemed to barely depict people, as if the viewer were in some haze. 



Still in the park, we stumbled on Estanque Grande de El Retiro, a pond. If you couldn’t already tell, this park had so much going on it. It was glorious. It felt like I was watching the movie of someone else’s life, someone sitting in one of those boats on the pond. As the sun began to set, people rowed out onto the water and waded along with the cute ducks. 

we had to make it elsewhere by sunset, so we couldn’t stay longer by the water, but nonetheless enjoyed the short moment we had

There was no better place to spend a Spanish sunset: at Azotea del Círculo, a stunning rooftop bar hugged by a panoramic view of Madrid. Prior to the trip, I asked everyone I knew who had been to Spain to give recommendations. The most thorough list came from my friend Marina S. ‘25, who I UROP’d with. She’s Spanish and kindly sent along the agenda her family used on their most recent trip home, which hyped up this bar the most. Good views, vibes, and drinks—not much else to ask for, really. There was a wide diversity of seating: full giant beds to lounge on, tall chairs with tall tables, and regular square tables with 4 chairs along each edge. Everybody could find a place that worked well for them. I ordered a tinto de verano, my new-found favorite drink that I had tried for the first time ever just a few days prior. Felt fitting, felt right. As the sun set in the backdrop of the endless skyline, it too set on our trip as a whole. We basked in the beauty of that moment for our final evening together on this leg to Spain.



This is when our group diverged for the evening, as previously mentioned from this morning. Gosha and Selena hit the shops, and I headed to Hammam Al Ándalus, home to Arab baths. I almost didn’t go because they were fully booked according to their website, but I felt very strongly about going and wanted to try anything I reasonably could to attempt to get a spot. After a long walk, I walked into the spa, explained to them my situation, but there were still no available spots. It made sense, and the staff were very kind about the situation. Ah well, I thought it was at least worth a shot. But, get this: just as I was leaving, by a stroke of good fortune, a customer had called in to cancel their spot! I was in. 
        Some things work out, even when they seem they absolutely won’t.
      




The Moroccan pools were simply transcendental. I felt fully immersed in serenity, like a step or two away from Nirvana. This may sound like hyperbole to you, but I assure you that I was definitely feeling these feelings. In the lobby, a staff member washed my hands in a bowl of warm water, scented according to my choice (I picked lavender), and provided me shoe coverings to keep the premise clean. I felt very… taken cared of? It was strangely nice; I had never experienced something quite like this before. They then escorted me to the locker room and showers, where I changed into a bathing suit, tucked my your items, and exited to the grounds. Everyone was instructed ahead of time to be silent, which I enjoyed. There were four sections of the grounds: baths, tea room, massage room, and steam room. Small candles, soft music, and sweet smells filled the premise. 

The pools were shallow and all varied in temperature, ascending in temperature from the entrance. There was no one in the first pool, and I soon found out why: it was extremely cold. I came to like it: the chill shocked you awake. I slowly moved through the pools, feeling my body temperature slowly rise. I found myself alternating between stretching, meditating, and floating in the waters. The hot waters helped loosen up my joints and muscles, so my stretches became deeper as the night progressed, which was a cool progression to see! After the hottest pool, I made my way to the tea room. I hadn’t seen a tea setup quite like this before, or since: one pot of tea and one pot of sweetened water. It was pretty smart, so you could easily adjust your sweetness without needing to stir: just pour in the water. I then returned to the pools, closed my eyes, and lounged for a while. My mind felt empty of my inner voice, only filled with the sounds of the spa. 

At some point, a staff member tapped me on the shoulder, told me it was time for the massage, and escorted me over. It was good: firm, yet delicate. I was then escorted back to the pools, but I instead walked over to the steam room since I hadn’t spent much time in it yet. It is what it sounds like, a room full of steam. I laid down and felt my mind and body melt away. Eventually, a staff member came in to let me know that my session had concluded. I then slowly left the grounds, got dressed, and took a car ride back to the hotel. Transfixed by that experience, which was my last outing in Europe, my trip came to a peaceful end. 

January 30th: Madrid → Boston

The next morning, I was supposed to meet up with people from MIT Astronomy because they were in Spain to work with big telescopes. But, due to a series of unfortunate logistical events, those plans were scrapped. 
        This was one of many times I almost met up with an MIT group in Europe.
      
 Still, it was wonderful to see first-hand that there are so many ways to get on an institution-sponsored trip; MIT truly values its global connections. 

I flew to Boston while Gosha and Selena flew to Paris. I decided to go back to campus early because (1) I wanted time to acclimate back to MIT from my past fall leave for the upcoming spring semester and (2) when I first go to Paris, I want to spend a lot of time there to breathe in the place instead of just a few days. Anyways, I was so eager to go back to MIT by this point. Of course, I adored this European trip, but I was also excited to learn in a more academic way than in a travel way. 

As the city skyline started creeping up in the corner of my plane window, I knew I was almost back home to be hugged by the arms of Boston. 

Final Words

We did it! For our Spanish leg, we visited four cities: Barcelona felt lively, Mataró felt industrial, València felt homey, and Madrid felt cosmopolitan. One word is never enough, but each helps capture Spain as a whole. 

This was simply a dream trip. None of us had expected that we would do anything like this during an IAP, but life works out in funny, wonderful ways sometimes. We hope you’ve enjoyed reading along this journey with us, and perhaps these blogs will elicit some wanderlust in you, too.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/05903f0437de6cf353f62ba3b0723d58.jpg

We’re Only Getting Older,Shorna A. '25,2,2024-02-05T00:00:00-05:00,"(a/n: My birthday was a few weeks ago! So this blog is just slightly behind schedule.)

Now Playing: Night Changes by One Direction

I turn twenty in four days. 

I always cry on my birthday. I think this is a surprisingly common behavior for lots of people. I couldn’t, really, tell you why this happens; It’s probably some combination of the pressure to be happy and the painful awareness that you are almost certainly less happy than you ought to be. 

For the past few years, birthdays have also just been slightly unlucky. Something doesn’t work out, and I end up incongruously sad around the end of January. Unfortunately, this year hasn’t been any different. I’ve spent a lot of time crying recently. 

I have a number of maladaptive coping mechanisms, but my inability to cry in front of other people is perhaps the most egregious. I know crying is a healthy outlet for big emotions, but there’s something terribly vulnerable about acknowledging that it is possible for anything to hurt you enough to make you cry. For the first time in a long time, I let a friend see me cry – not intentionally, I just ended up tearing up when trying to explain a situation. I hate crying. I am all too frequently disgusted at myself for trying too hard for too little return, caring (and hurting) too much, failing too often. Believing in one’s own infallibility is a dangerous drug. I’m far from perfect, but I often think that I should be able to handle difficulties that I cannot, and don’t need, to handle on my own. 

At some point, while wiping warm tears from my face, I told my friend “I’m sorry, I’m too old for this.” He chuckled, and said “You’re 19.” 

And that’s it, I suppose. I’m not too old for this. I’m not supposed to have everything figured out by now. “It’s okay for everything not to be fine.”

I found my first gray hair about a month ago. When I told my mother about it, her immediate response was to advise me: “don’t pull it out!” I understand why. The need to look young and beautiful is a shackle, the kind that you wear willingly to avoid the empty feeling of weightlessness. I’ve always looked eerily similar to my mom. Over winter break she showed me a picture from her medical school days, and I look just as much like her as I always have. It’s strange to feel as though some version of yourself is looking back at you from a yellowed photograph.

I have fine lines around my eyes now. I wonder if I’m supposed to feel as neutral about physical aging as I do. My mom, for the first time, has started to look at my skin approvingly – I started applying ointment, wearing sunscreen, and regularly moisturizing this year. I still haven’t grown out of hormonal acne of my tweens, but I’ve learned to control breakouts. 

I wonder how much of life is simply learning oneself. I only use glass water bottles, because I can’t stand the taste of water that’s been sitting in a metal container for too long. I prefer drawing my eyeliner wing to the center of my lashes. I only really fall for people I don’t like.

There are other important lessons one learns, though. Crying is a lot less painful in the presence of friends. Hold on to the people you love. Hugs and hot chocolate can fix many (although not all) problems. It’s usually not better to leave things unsaid. Unkindness is practically never useful. 

Getting older, I figure, is supposed to include deciding what you stand for. I think there are a few things that matter particularly to me. One of them is duty. I bear responsibility to my family, my friends, and my community. I really love the quiet satisfaction of acquiring knowledge, and the opportunity to use it. It is important to me to always think about the impacts of my actions and to take care of the people in my life. 

For so long, I have also wanted to do as much good as possible with the time I’ve been allotted. But good is hard to quantify, and I am frequently shocked at how much I am motivated by the short-term goal of making people happy, rather than solely fixating on the grandiose vision of ‘goodness’ I had settled on at the age of thirteen. So, I suppose, I should add joy to the list. Striving for it, and endeavoring to cause it. Finding it in the little things. Noticing it swirling in the snow while I launch snowballs at my friends, floating in the sundubu we had for dinner a week ago, and in the abiding stillness of the Charles at midnight.

And yet, for all of this, I am still deeply tired. Youth is fleeting, and I am not always sure that I like being young, particularly. I am bad at accepting incompleteness. At points, my internal model for aging has been to envision it as a process of rectification, akin to getting up off the ground, brushing oneself off, and straightening a disheveled appearance. But I doubt that things are so linear, or that I am in all ways better than all past versions of myself. I have, at points, been more tolerant, disciplined, and forgiving than I am now. But all states of being are transient, and I am more confident and happier than I have been at most points in the past.

It is easy to lose perspective. Today during therapy I expressed that I was, in fact, stressed about everything. About the upcoming semester, my growing mountain of responsibilities, my job prospects, my muddy career aspirations, and my future in general. About aging, and feeling so… lost. About how difficult it can be to want to get out of bed in the morning. My therapist graciously snapped back to reality by reminding me that “Many of the things that stress you out are also the things that make you happy. You love these things.” She’s right. I choose to do things that are difficult because I deem them fruitful. It is important to remember that.

My friends have a running joke that my life is, in many ways, like a mediocre TV show. They’ll periodically joke that the “writers have lost the plot”, and bicker about who would be the fan-favorite character (to Mihir and Alison: you’re a *dynamic duo*, the audience couldn’t possibly choose a favorite). I think this is a nice way to think about life. Everything comes in seasons. You have arcs that are good and bad, and it’s more entertaining because it’s a mixed bag. Life is better if you can laugh at it. Good prevails, in the end. 

And everything works out, eventually. People who are much older and wiser than me have promised that last one, so I’ll take a leap of faith and believe them. 

Life is often more beautiful than it has any right to be, and the quaintest things have the best way of reminding you of that. Today on the walk back to Next, I watched a gaggle of Canada geese take flight into a clear blue sky, shaking snow off their feet during their ascent and honking annoyedly. Geese are lovely, absurd little creatures. People are, too.",,0
[Guest Post] Why did I come to MIT?,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",1,2024-02-02T00:00:00-05:00,"Content warning: brief mentions of anxiety, BPD, hospitalization

Hi ≧◡≦ , my name is River. Just like most people, I had dreamed of coming to this university since childhood. And now I am about to enter my sophomore spring here! Yet, despite all those years of dreaming and planning, none of it really came true. I never expected to be the person who I am now.

When I entered MIT, I had a different name and went by different pronouns. My two passions were basketball and programming. I was on the Varsity Girls basketball team, and completely dove into 6-3 major classes from my freshman fall. 

And now? I am not on the team anymore, and I have no idea where I am going with my classes….or my life.

So this makes me think….why did I come here? 

1. tO eXplOrE

It is often said that “college is the place to explore! So you can discover your interests!” But I have grown to realize that at least for me, I won’t know what I am interested in for at least a few years after college graduation. And that’s okay. In fact, I hear it all the time from MIT alumni (I work as a techcaller yipee!). They tell me that it sometimes takes industry exploration to figure that out, but luckily, you can always switch jobs and that it is worth it to try different environments (e.g. big companies, startups, software, hardware, management, etc.).

But I have been trying to figure out what I like though! At MIT, I have explored areas that I never have before in software, hardware, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. I even learned to sow at the Metropolis Makerspace and made a reversible pencil case. I became familiar with shop equipment in 2.00b and constructed a wooden pull toy. I am learning how to be a leader through dorm government, as I was recently elected president of my living community East Campus?!?! *In highschool, I never cared about government* And I am also exploring my sexuality and gender identity by changing how I present myself and letting myself be attracted to whoever I feel like. 

But spending lots of time exploring also kind of sucks. Because what they don’t tell you is that by exploring, it means you do not develop a professional expertise straight away. I am no expert in anything. I am a decent programmer that has not been studying for swe interviews because of my explorations as a novice electrical and mechanical engineer. Most of my 6-3 friends have already taken the algorithms class (6.006), and I have yet to take the prereq (6.042). Instead this past semester, I took circuits (6.002), dynamics (2.003), computation structures (6.004), differential equations (18.03), and linguistics (idk the number). I am attacking my degree with a breadth-first search instead of a depth-first search….plus, I am not even certain what I want my degree to be (6-2? 6-1? 2A-6? 6-3?).

To be transparent, this approach has limited me because I have been rejected from research opportunities on campus and internships for not having enough background. And while that has been difficult, I know that it is okay because I would rather complete my degree slower, than graduate fast and always wonder….what would have happened if I had picked up the circuit board? 

2. to struggle 

And oh I have……

My freshman fall, I struggled the most with fear. The fear of the workload, exams, and not being good enough. I found myself studying in every free second I had because I was terrified that the MIT rigor would consume me. Quickly, I realized that the school was a lot more doable then I initially thought, so I decided to let myself enjoy some of that free time. I then slipped into the opposite problem of being too relaxed…sleeping through classes, starting assignments hours before the deadline, and just making bad decisions. 

My freshman spring, I fell deeper into my work-life balance struggle. I missed most of my classes this semester. I barely passed physics (8.02) with a C-, and I found myself quitting the varsity basketball team after 10 years of playing the sport because I could not keep up. But while this semester was a lot of struggle, I was improving. I strengthened my relationships with the people around me. I reached out to a therapist, and I took the mistakes that I was making to heart so that I would not make them again. 

My sophomore fall, I started seeing the light at the end of the tunnel…..or so I thought. I maintained a healthy 8 hour sleep schedule. I started off strong with making it to all my classes, although that gradually decreased as the semester went on. I made sure to go to office hours regularly, and I was doing well with handling 5 courses on top of being an active member of East Campus Exec. And on paper I was thriving, but I was struggling to regulate my emotions. I was struggling with exploring my identity. I started testosterone and I loved it, but I was scared to face the world as a gender nonconforming individual. Eventually, all things came crashing down. I ended up hospitalized throughout the last week of classes. I did not take any of my finals and OX’d all classes but one which I late dropped, so I could focus on a 5 week intensive outpatient program. I started struggling with feelings of failure for falling apart before completing the semester. I also struggled with my new diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and anxiety. 

And there is a lot of struggling that I do not feel comfortable talking about here…so now one might re-ask the question. If I have been struggling so much…..why did I come to MIT? 

Because it’s worth it. The struggle takes me places that I am grateful for.

There have been great lows, but there have been amazing highs as well. I have made memories that I will never forget in these short few semesters, most notably, this year’s pumpkin drop. It was the hardest event that I have ever organized in my entire life, but I will never forget watching 150+ pumpkins drop from Tang Hall and explode right before my eyes. I will never forget watching my community, who I love so much, come together to help me ensure this event had enough manpower (turns out it is A LOT of work to pick, gut, and transport all the pumpkins as well as clean up afterwards). This event also ended up in this news article?!?! I don’t know how but here is the link that I found: https://www.wfla.com/dont-miss/watch-what-happens-when-pumpkins-are-tossed-off-a-24-story-building/. 

So I did do a lot of cool stuff this past semester. Even with the catastrophic ending, there were still many good parts. The semester was not a failure. Outside of pumpkin drop, I helped run 3 foster care workshops as a part of my UROP with the Media Lab! These workshops were where the Media Lab’s Affective Computing Group put our creative software technologies that aimed to support foster youth mental health to the test. I also helped run a nation-wide study with the Personal Robotics Group, and I helped analyze the data afterwards to co-write a paper. I became a Campus Ambassador for Monster Energy! I came out as trans to my living group via a meme, and I had other amazing experiences such as cooking 100 dumplings and then breaking 2 instapots while doing so.

I have also really embraced the small moments. My favorite is my friends and I belting “We are Young” in the infinite corridor with McDonald’s takeout in hand at 3am. I love when people I recognize wave to me in the hall. I love watching movies with my roommates. I love failing an exam with a friend, so I don’t feel alone.

I love my roommates <3

So, I do like the struggle. The one thing that I have in common with my high school self is yearning for the struggle at MIT. This struggle has helped me realize how wonderful my friends are. This struggle made my big highs even bigger and my small moments gigantic. The struggle pushes me but I find myself stronger each semester. It makes me grow, and I am happy with that growth and where it is heading. 

I am growing into a person who can have a healthy schedule, mind, and work-life balance. I am growing into a well-rounded engineer, and I am growing into a leader with strong communication and organization skills. I am growing into a person who knows how to love themself. I am not there yet but that is where I am headed because of my struggles.

3. to have fun

And I always know how to have fun;)

4. because that’s life

Sometimes I think to myself, I am failing. I regret that I did not just focus on studying 6-3 to become the best software engineer ever. After all, academics is first priority….right?

But I have changed my mind. Instead of academics, my first priority for college is to learn how to embrace life. 

Life is a series of exploration, struggle, and fun. You constantly have to explore how you want to live your life socially, professionally, and independently. And while cliche, life is a constant series of unavoidable struggles, so you have to learn how to face them. And you have to have fun in life. The fun is what makes living soooo gooooood. 

College is just navigating life in a more controlled environment, so I want to make the most of that and I do not regret that decision one bit. I used to feel like I wasted the last 1.5 years of my life on meaningless exploration and maybe too much fun that set me behind amongst my MIT peers. But now I realize that none of those experiences were meaningless. If anything, all my struggles and experiences are evidence that I am tackling life here and making the most of the MIT college experience.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image8-800x1066.jpg

We Stan Matt Parker,Paige B. '24,4,2024-02-02T00:00:00-05:00,"In my junior year of high school, I started taking single-variable calculus at my local community college. I began to feel like a real college student (at least, for a high school student). But I remember sitting in lecture, and at some point thinking: “is this what mathematicians do all day?”, which was a question quickly followed up by: “wait,,,, what do mathematicians actually… do?”

And it’s not like I haven’t had this question before. For example, I asked these questions when I was learning about how to multiply multiple-digit-numbers in elementary school, thinking to myself “surely mathematicians don’t sit in their offices all day multiplying bigger and bigger numbers”. But when I was younger, I knew that this couldn’t be the case. I just had no sense of what college-level maths looked like. So I ate my mathematical-vegetables and went on with my life.

So ending up in my first ever college class and asking the same questions was frankly a bit of a shock. And don’t get me wrong, calculus is beautiful, and (some) mathematicians do use calculus in their day-to-day life (including myself!). But calculus felt too… closed? I guess? I’m sorry, I am missing the exact right words for this, but to put it frankly: Calculus felt like, finished in some sense. It felt too polished. Like, what mathematician with a PhD is sitting in their office “researching” how to solve the integral

The answer is 69.

So anyways, I’m taking this calculus class and trying to figure out a) what maths after calculus looks like, and b) if I want to actually do that math. Then, I found a maths comedy special by Matt Parker.

Matt Parker has done a lot but you may have most commonly seen him on NumberPhile, or you may have read one of his books Humble Pi or Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension (to name a few). 
         You may also know him from the Parker Square.
      


In this comedy special, Matt Parker talks about the concept of 4-dimensional space. I’ve written about 4-dimensional worms before (here and here), but let me discuss the concept here again too for those who may be unfamiliar (as I once was before I watched Parker’s comedy special).

You may have heard that we live in a three-dimensional world, but what does this mean? Well, one way we can describe this is that we can move in three directions: up/down, left/right, and forward/back. Alternatively, you can look at the corner of the room you are in, and see how many walls it takes to form the corner (i.e., three). The same concept is true in lower dimensions. For example, to picture two dimensions, simply imagine a piece of paper with a square on it. Notice how it takes two lines to “form a corner” of the square. Similarly, characters in 2-dimensional video games really only need two directions to describe where they are in space: up/down and left/right. You can picture an old-school 8-bit Mario moving left/right, or up/down, but there are no other directions for the 8-bit mario to move in (at least, not until Super Mario 64). Lastly, we can think of lines being one-dimensional (like the number line).

But what about four dimensions? We can’t quite necessarily picture 4-dimensional space well, but sometimes people refer to time as the fourth dimension. If we consider time to be the fourth dimension, then our four directions would be:

Up/Down, Left/Right, Forward/Back, and Future/Past.

Side note: viewing time as the fourth dimension is actually what my worm blogposts are about. In any case, when mathematicians talk about four dimensions, they typically mean something slightly more abstract and slightly more physical (in a way I will explain right now).

One way we can make dimensions more “physical” is to think about how we measure “volume” in those spaces. For example,

- 1D: Length: We can measure the length of a line segment.

- 2D: Area: We can measure the area of a rectangle via the formula base times height, where both the base and height are in some sense 1-dimensional (they are just the lengths of the sides of the rectangle).

- 3D: Volume: We can measure the volume of a rectangular-box via the formula base times height times width (notice that this requires knowing three 1-dimensional parameters…)

- 4D: ?????? It’s kinda unclear! But, if we wanted to find the volume of a four-dimensional box, it would make sense if it required four 1-dimensional parameters, like base, height, width, and then some other length in a different (fourth) direction.

Hopefully I’ve done a good enough job of trying to give a sense of what four (or more) dimensions kinda means.

In any case: Matt Parker. In Parker’s comedy special, he spends like an hour trying to explain how we can try to visualize the fourth dimension. And, sure, we can define the fourth dimension abstractly and mathematically, but actually trying to visualize higher dimensions is a bit of a difficult task! I think Matt Parker does a really good job of this, and highly recommend watching the video.

Upon watching this special, I started to realize that I really wanted to understand four dimensions better. I wanted to understand five dimensions; six; seven; hell, why not n-dimensions??? (by which I mean arbtirarily-many dimensions).

But I was only in single-variable calculus, and I didn’t really understand do mathematics in 4 dimensions, let alone n. So I forgot about it and moved on with my life.

Cut to my senior fall of high school when I’m taking multi-variable calculus and linear algebra, and OHMYGOD I AM FINALLY DOING MATHS IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS. Granted, most of the maths is in three dimensions, but doing calculus in three dimensions makes it clear how one would do it in higher dimensions.

But it was still unclear to me how I could picture five+ dimensions. I mean, because of Matt Parker’s comedy special I could somewhat visualize four dimensions in my head, but five+ dimensions seemed just out of reach. And surely, there wasn’t some way to use mathematics to picture higher dimensions.

All the while, I find myself applying to colleges for undergrad. For one of the application 
        essays,
      
 I found myself writing about a “topic you have explored simply because it sparked your intellectual curiosity”. In particular, I wrote about being inspired by Matt Parker and wanting to learn how to picture n-dimensions in college. But surely that wouldn’t happen.

Cut to being at MIT and doing maths research and OHMYGOD I CAN USE MATHEMATICS TO PICTURE n-DIMENSIONS. Most of my research at MIT for the past three years has been about trying to visualize n dimensions (in some sense). I love this research. I love that I can roughly explain my research to other people, and I love that I do this work in arbitrary dimension. In fact, most of why I like this type of research (in the field of maths known as analysis) is because I like being able to explain what it is I study to other people. And hell, this is part of the reason I fell in love with the concept of mathematics in the first place: Matt Parker’s ability to explain the concept of four dimensions to people in a comedy special is exceptional, and I wanted to one day be able to do this one day. But surely, I wouldn’t get the opportunity to explain what I research to other mathematicians until I was a professor.

Cut to being a senior at MIT, and BEING INVITED TO PRESENT ON MY MATHEMATICS RESEARCH AT THE JOINT MATHEMATICS MEETING (JMM). For those who don’t know (and to be completely fair, I didn’t know what the JMM was until last year when there was one in Boston), the JMM is the largest mathematics conference in the world, and I was invited to present at two of the smaller sessions in my area of analysis! It was my very first JMM presenting material, and I presented on all the n-dimensional research I and others in my field have been working on. It was so much fun, and I got to meet a lot of really cool people.

One of those cool people I got to meet was MATT PARKER!!

It’s Matt Parker!! and me!! in a photo!! together!! not photoshopped!!

During the JMM, there was a Mathematics Art Revue show with jugglers, dancers, 
         poets, 
      
 and more, and the show was being emceed by Matt Parker. After the show, he was in the lobby meeting people and signing people’s names in binary (he signed my JMM nametag!).

I told him about how much his comedy special influenced me. I told him how I wrote about it in my MIT application, how I was inspired to continue investigating mathematics, and how it led me to pursue mathematics research that I was presenting on at that year’s JMM. All because of a maths comedy show that I watched ~five years earlier. How the time flies.

P.S.: If you’re interested in learning more about my research and what mathematics research looks like, my plan is to write about this in my next blogpost! Stay tuned :)

P.P.S: I used “maths” instead of “math” throughout this blogpost, and fun fact: when I applied to undergrad, I did used “maths” or “mathematics” instead of “math” in all of my essays.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/haha69-400x237.jpg

ripping shirts,Amber V. '24,0,2024-02-01T00:00:00-05:00,"Clothes are so fun! I love tailoring my outfits to whatever is happening — baggy metal shirts for long hours in shop, sleeveless shirts for the forge, cropped ones for social events that don’t include bits of flying steel. One of the major joys of MechE for me has been the ability to shape the world around me, and clothing mods are a great part of that. So here are some projects I’ve done over the past year — most of them quick and dirty little bursts of creativity as the mood strikes and party-o-clock hour encroaches.

sewing shirts

Est. time: 1 hour each

Shoutout to Metropolis for the use of their sewing machine, and for the friends who showed me how to use it!

 

rapid-fire crop tops

est. time: as fast as possible because i was already late to the events


        B1
      
 throws one campus-wide party per semester, and we always have fun themed shirts! The designs are by students on floor. These mods were done in about 15 minutes with sharpie, scissors, and trust in the 
        iterative process.
      


misc other cutting and tying t-shirts

est. time: 30 min

#1 marketable skill

b1 had a craft REX event (tie dye and embroidery)

est. time: 60 minutes

slightly punk jean jacket

est. time: 30 min?

I put some spikes in it.



bleach-painting jeans

est. time: 2 hrs

I found these black cargo pants at a thrift store in Arizona for $7! However I already had cooler better black pants with excessive pockets, so these ones needed something to make them interesting. I sketched designs in chalk, then painted them on in bleach following this youtube video.

And that’s a wrap! Here’s to more hastily chopped-up shirts in the weeks to come.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PXL_20240126_010304623-800x1067.jpg

Every year, a group of so-called important people in the show business pass out little men and women to those who they think did a good job at making movies and TV shows in the year before. I decided to do the same thing for all the movies/shows I’ve watched in 2023.

Movies

Favorite Movie That I Saw for the First Time

This Guy Joined a Band in College, and That Small Animal is Riding a Huge Wave

Both movies are about a young man who want to be the best at what they do.

Favorite Movie That I Watched Again

The True Man Show My favorite movie ever is Living Thing Inside or On Another Living Thing, but this is probably my #2.

The Most Boring Movie I Have Seen

Guys Who Turn Into Cars



It would have been fine if it wasn’t for the humans.

The Movie That Was Way Better Than I Thought It Would Be

Bar-Be as the Lady with a Lot of Money, and the Lady with Not So Much Money

It’s a really good movie. I had no idea that Mark In Short was in this.

The Movie That Makes Me Look like I Know More Than I Really Do

Some Black-and-White Movie



TV Shows

The Show I Like and Want to Talk to People About

That Show About Angry Food People



The Show That I Do Not Explain to People

That Show About Actual Food People

The Show that I Like Quite a Good Bit

Friends



Fastest Show I Have Ever Completed

To Be Mad At Someone (or, The Stuff Inside the Black-and-White Animal)

I love this show. Got me through the second half of my second year at college.

The Show That I Thought Was Good but Then It Got VERY Good

He Is Bad at Acting, But Boy is He Good at Killing

A Week of UROPing,Jessica Z. '27,1,2024-01-31T00:00:00-05:00,"The first month of the year is a beautiful time for students here: no every-day classes, no problem sets, no only a few last-minute, late nights. Without classes this month to focus on, I started working under some teachers and students on Course 2 work. I talked about this in my last writing (with more words), but my work builds upon some of my high school interests.

Back in high school, I was really interested in the art of turning and pressing paper down for three key reasons: 1.) I liked the Course 18/Course 2 reasoning behind how it worked, 2.) it can be used in a lot of different fields to make work that can help the lives of many people, and 3.) paper art is pretty. With that in mind, I started reaching out to different teachers who had work focusing on paper art. After a few conversations, I found a group of people in Course 2 that I enjoyed talking to and soon joined!

1/22/24 to 1/24/24

 



1/25/24 to 1/26/24

 

When the grips pull each end of the paper, the paper won’t immediately tear like you might first expect—instead, because of the cuts, it makes the paper much stronger and able to handle more force. Using the facts given by the computer, I wanted to make a force/area + change-in-body figure to understand how spacing between cuts changes the paper to avoid breaking.

I really enjoyed being able to learn more about Course 2 through this work, and it helped me understand that I am interested in studying more next year, although I’m not 100% sure on what Course I want to study the most for the next three years… but that’s a writing for another time (with more than just the top ten hundred most used words) :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7879a-800x450.jpeg

the Big Rocks are calling and I must go,Audrey C. '24,2,2024-01-31T00:00:00-05:00,"I thought about writing about walking on Big Rocks in the cold after this up goer five thing ended, since I wish nothing but to use normal words again. But then I thought that I may never get to call “Big Rock walking” well, Big Rock walking again, so I might as well… What I’m having a hard time saying through words can be said through my Big Rock pictures, which speak for themselves. The Big Rocks have a lot to say, just not through the words that you and I use.

things i miss and don’t miss,Chris S. '11,1,2024-01-31T00:00:00-05:00,"In 1984, a book lots of people have read, the people in control made some words easier, because it stops people from making big thoughts to kick out the people in control. Are we buying into this?

I am a very old person here. In fact, I am 35 years old, almost two times the age when I went to this Well Known School of Three Letters. That’s like another life since I left! I miss this place a lot though. I used to write here, but the last time was 7.5 years (!) ago.

Because Old People only like to talk about the past, I want to tell you what I miss and don’t miss about each part of my life since I left this school. Too bad for you if you are young and don’t care. The person in control here said I could.

***

Well Known School of Three Letters 🎓 What I miss Do you know what I really miss? I miss being able to eat a Huge Wrap from this eating place at school that is known for them (however, I was at school 2 months ago and they seem to have closed?).

I no longer have the stomach for it. Well, I can still eat it, but I will fall asleep very quickly. That is not very good for getting things done and this makes me sound like a Very Old Person. I used to eat one of these Huge Wraps on my way back to the living place. One hour after I get there, when I sit down to work on some Problem Sets, I feel empty again and must eat more. Oh! The stomach of young people!

me eating, 17 years ago

I miss having clear end points in which to get things done. I would finish my classes, and then it is a time to rest or do fun things. When you become an Old Person and leave school, you seem to always be working. You are never done. You rest sometimes. Things get worse when you have children. I understand now what The Little Important Person means when he talks about Old People. That they no longer have time to listen and understand the little things. All they want is to get on and through with it.

What I don’t miss I don’t miss answering questions that are much too hard. I got very good schooling out of this school, and I am very pleased with it. It made me and still makes me think well. However, it is a little funny (and maybe a little sad) that I still get repeat bad dreams from this Well Known School of Three Letters. It happens like once or two times a year. I would be sitting down in the Large Building of a Person Who Walks and I will sit down to answer questions. I turn the first piece of paper, and I have NO IDEA what I am looking at, although I have studied for a week to be able to answer the questions. I flip through the rest of the questions, and it is all the same. Then, I usually wake up. It’s a bit sad, but maybe I will carry this for life.

I also don’t miss not having money. But good news if you are not an Old Person! You probably will have money soon! Maybe a lot of money if you work with computers!

Training to be a doctor (in the Big City) 🍎 What I miss I miss eating in the Big City. There is so much food! My favorite are Long Foods That Come In Some Hot Water With Great Smell, first made by this place far away from here. In that place far across the big water, they make very good Long Foods. Now, the Big City is full of eating places that have Long Foods. I think Long Foods might be my favorite thing to eat (it is also the same for my children. see. many things can run in families).

life, in 3 words

I miss being able to get on the train. There are so many trains. Getting around is so easy. Now I drive all the time. You need to look at the road when you are driving, or you will hit people and get into trouble. I also can’t read stuff when I am driving, but I can do that when I am sitting on a train. Reading makes your brain better.

my wife (then just married!), going to work, 2016

i am also going to work, on the other side of the tracks #doctors

What I don’t miss I don’t miss fighting with people for a table to eat food in eating places. There are way too many people. Life is too short to wait in lines all the time. Life is too short to deal with people who are not nice to you and push you out of the way because they need to be at places.

I don’t miss small living spaces and taking lifts. I don’t miss having money but spending all that money for a place to live. I don’t miss spending one hour to get to the Place With Sky Busses. Real talk – I’ve spent DAYS of my life sitting in trains to get to the Place With Sky Busses. The Big City has three of these places, and they are all so far from the city!

***

Training to be a doctor (in the Little Town) 🚜 What I miss I miss the quiet. When I was in the Big City, it was so loud at night. There were loud cars driving by all the time. The first week when I moved to the Little Town I was surprised at how quiet it was. I could hear every little thing outside. We go to a park at the end of the week and we have the whole place. I go running from my house and in ten minutes I am running next to animals in the field. Crazy. I don’t think I will ever live in a place like that again.

running along pretty roads, 2020

It’s weird, but I miss this time in my training to be a doctor. This is when I started training to be a doctor who deals with Bad Things that Grow in the Body. We try to take away the Bad Things by either cutting it out, burning it with Strong Power, or by using Strong Water that we put in the body. There is much we don’t know about these Bad Things. We don’t really know why some people have it, and others don’t. Very often, we find out too late and there is not much we can do. We may try our best, but our best might hurt the person more. So then we don’t do much. Other times, we can take away the Bad Thing completely. This is why I like being this kind of doctor so much. There is no one answer that fits all questions. I have to meet the person I’m helping where they are at. When I was in training, I could just learn. I didn’t need to be the Big Doctor. I could be the Small Doctor in Training and just hold the other person’s hand in the room. Sometimes that helps more than the Big Doctor’s words.

there is always hope

What I don’t miss I don’t miss the quiet. Really, this was the biggest reason why we left the Little Town. At the end of every week we would go through the twenty things we could do with our kids. The twenty things got old pretty quickly. It was a great place for children to grow up, but it was too boring. We want to be in a bigger place.

There are times I don’t miss being the Small Doctor in Training. I like that now I can give clear answers without always checking in with someone else. I like having enough words in my brain to give the right words to the person sitting in front of me. I like now being the teacher to other Small Doctors in Training.

***

Being a Big Doctor (in the Big/Little City) 🐳 So it’s been a long time since I left the Well Known School of Three Letters. Every year, I still speak with about ten students who want to come to this school. I say good for them. This is really an amazing place, and if you know enough about this place to be reading these words, you have done your work and want to be somewhere amazing (or you are already at this amazing place!). Good for you!

I like talking to students because they remind me of what it was like to have big dreams. I still try to think big, but it really does get harder with time. You have heard this a hundred times a hundred times a hundred times before, but it’s true. Now I spend a lot of time trying to not forget to pick my kids up from their school, and what to make for dinner. It’s okay, it’s just a different time in life.

This School’s Big Game: a fun way to think too hard,Rachel F. '12,5,2024-01-25T00:00:00-05:00,"I love to play with big weird words, so writing in Up-Goer Five makes me feel like my brain has broken and turned into soft food for babies 🫠. But because the point of using only simple words is NOT to make things more confusing, I have hidden some real words used by 
        game-problem-loving-people
      
 and other studying-people that might be hard for you to find if I did not say them. You can see them if you hold your computer-pointing thing over any words with a small number to the right of them.

ANYWAY, 
        This School’s Big Game
      
 happens once a year, and it is filled with up to 3 days of many very-hard, 
        fun, made-up game-problems
      
 that are fun to do together with friends. There are many other 
        big-games
      
, but ours is one of the oldest and most layer-on-layer big-games in the world. It is a very important bringing-together time for this school and people who went to this school, but others can play too!

I thought I could write a short paper of words about the Big Game, but it turns out that the Big Game is so layer-on-layer that I needed to write quite a lot to say not just what it is like, but why we love it, which is an important part of understanding why the Big Game works the way it does.

It is the best, hardest, and most fun big-game in my life. It is my favorite break time of the entire year. But it is not a break time for resting. Instead, we spend the time thinking very hard together, harder than we think at any other time of the year.

what is the Big Game like?

first, what are the game-problems in the Big Game like?

Do you like fun made-up game-problems? Many people enjoy doing game-problems in the news-paper, like “cross words”, or 
        moving the letters of words around to make other words
      
, or 
        putting lots of numbers into boxes to make the numbers add up right in many different ways at the same time
      
.

Think about those normal game-problems, but now: what if they were VERY, VERY hard? What if it did not look like any problem you had ever seen before, and did not tell you how to start or what to do? Or what if it looked like a normal game-problem, but had very different ways than any other game-problem?

What if it wrapped around its self (maybe in a way that goes through its self too!), or repeated its self in small ways if you looked closer, or it was very well hidden inside a thing that you listen to, or mixed up bits of ten different speaking-ways of the world, or was ten hundred times bigger than normal so you had to write computer-words to tell a computer how to help you?

I was good-surprised by how easy it was to give Up-Goer Five names to these groups of hard number-like things. Of course, it would be harder to talk about exactly how each of these things works and how it is made.

What if the problem then 
        did that kind of thing more than once
      
? What if it also took many of the brain-hurting game-problem-ways I just talked about, and pushed them all together into one game-problem at the same time?

That is what Big Game problems are like, and that is why it is such a hard game. Each problem can take many hours. Even for someone who is very good at Big Game problems, the hardest problems in the whole game could take ten or more hours!

how you know if you are doing the game-problems the right way

But if the game-problems are so strange and hard, and they don’t tell you how to do them, then: how do you know if you are doing them right?

You see, they are very well-made. It can take a while to figure out what to do, but the game-problems are 
        made so that once you find the right direction, all the pieces fit together just right, and there is no other way things could be
      
. If you go in a wrong direction, then the pieces won’t fit together well, and you have to think of different ways to use them.

You will not get the answers only by guessing, because the answers are very weird, and 
        you are not allowed to send in too many guesses too fast
      
. (It is okay to miss some pieces and send in just a few wrong answers while you try your best to answer a game-problem.)

To make sure they are well-made, the problems are checked a lot before they get put into the real game, by different people on the game-making team who have never before seen the problem they are checking. These 
        game-problem-checking-people
      
 figure out where the problem is not well-made, and help it get fixed. If a problem’s pieces all fit together just right with a bad answer that the game-problem-making-person did not plan for, or if no checking-person is able to get the right answer without help, then the problem is not well-made.

The problems in the Big Game have made me so used to very-well-made problems that I get mad when I do different games where the game-problems have not been checked well. It is no fun to just guess from ten possible answers where each one feels as right as the other ones. I love the feeling of finishing a Big Game problem and seeing all the problem-pieces fit each other just right. 😌

the Big Game as a whole

In the Big Game, each problem is usually in a round with ten or twenty other problems. You fit the problem-answers in the round together to figure out the 
        around-problem
      
. Then there are ten or twenty more rounds, and the rounds also fit together with each other in round-rounds, to make around-around-problems. There are so many problems! This year there were 237 problems, the most ever seen in the Big Game. 😱 (Although 50 of them were easy ones — long story. Even without those, it was still a lot for the Big Game!)

There is no way for just one person to play through this whole game on their own any more. As with anything in life, you will get farther with a team of friends! My team has a lot of people who lived in my school-home building at this school, which warms my heart and makes me think of the good-times I had in my school-home. My team also has a lot of people who did not go to this school at all, and they are great too.

My team is big, but the Big Game is usually made so that teams don’t win just by being big. One of the strongest teams is 3-4 times smaller than my team, and they still get first place often. That is another hard part of making this game: making it feel good and fun to all kinds of teams, small and big, new and old.

You do not need to finish every problem in the Big Game to get to the end of the game. You can finish all the around-problems and around-around problems if you get most of the game-problems. The around-problems are made to let you figure out their answers if you do not have every single problem-answer, although that is more hard than when you have every answer.

Big Games have stories!

The Big Game has more than just game-problems! Every Big Game going back for a long time (maybe the 90s) also has a fun story. The people who make the Big Game play-act that they are other people with different life stories. They pretend that a bad thing has happened to them, and we can help them by finding the answers to the game-problems. Sometimes the play-acting people 
        visit our team-rooms to show us fun story-bits
      
, and sometimes 
        we visit them to play games like the ones kids play (but a little harder) that are little pieces of the Big Game
      
.

This year, the story was about people who study space, and old gods from long-ago who share names with the biggest space-rocks in our part of space. A well-known space-studying person broke the smallest of the biggest space rocks while the studying-people were very-not-agreeing about what kind of space rock it was, and this killed the god who shares a name with that space rock. The other gods were VERY mad. We helped make it right, of course by figuring out many game-problems that helped us bring back the dead god and his space rock.

I loved last year’s story because of the way the problems and the story were built so close together with each other. There were cute pretend-game-people where their way of saying and being told you many things (even hard number things!) about the way the game-problems in their rounds worked. Also, many around-problems were 
        real not just in our world, but also real in the same way in the story
      
, although that is only the smallest bit of why the story did a good job. But I will not tell you all of it here in case you want to read or hear it for yourself in words besides only the most used words.

sometimes, the Big Game is made in a completely new way!

2021 was the first year ever where people were not allowed to come in person, because of the very bad sick that made the entire world stop working the year before.

The 2021 Big Game making team did something that is so hard to do very well in such a short time, that anyone who speaks to computers would say it is a bad idea to even think about trying. But they somehow did it well anyway!! They built an AMAZING computer game as part of their Big Game, that let us walk in it together. The computer game was set up so it looked like we were at a place like this school but different, in another world that was part of the story.

where I got this picture

The computer game was made to let 1500 people walk in just the same computer-game-room at the same time, and for many more to be in the whole game at the same time. They made all this in less than a year and it worked very well for people all over the world without breaking, which is so hard that many computer-game-making money-making-groups would have a hard time doing it even with lots of money. But no one got paid with money for this! They made it all from love of the Big Game.

As we walked around not-quite-this-school together to find game-problems in the computer game, it really felt like we were walking together, the way we would at the Big Game in real life. After the sad year of feeling alone and not being able to hug most friends, this game touched my heart and made me cry in a happy way.

No Big Game has ever done anything like this, and now that we can go back in person for the Big Game, probably no Big Game ever will. I will always remember this Big Game for the way it warmed my heart after the long year of worst sad times.

why do we love the Big Game so much?

Besides having a cute story, the Big Game sounds strange to many. It hurts our brains so much that we groan and even get mad a lot while playing. You might think that not very many people would want to play. But did you know that more than 4000 people play it every year? (That is four times more people than the number of different words I am allowed to use right now!! 🫠)

first, a bit about type 2 fun

I think that the Big Game is so strange and so loved by many people from this school because we love working with numbers in strange ways, thinking too hard 😅, and making hard interesting things happen that can only be done by working and thinking too hard. People who don’t like these things have a bad time here and do not like to stay, because those are the kinds of things this school makes us do every day.

The things we do in the Big Game and at this school are a kind of “type 2 fun”. Here is a place that tells you how these types of fun work.

- Type 1 fun is just normal fun, where everything is good.

- Type 2 fun is when you do something so hard that it hurts you a lot, but when you finish, it is fun to think back on all you did. To me, type 2 fun feels even more amazing and fun than normal fun, but only after it is done.

- Type 3 fun is never fun at any time. It is not fun while doing the thing, and it is not fun even after you are done. (If your body gets so cold that you stop thinking right, or you have to share a broken bathroom with many people who are sick, those would be kinds of type 3 fun. No one wants those!) Type 3 fun can make a good story even though nothing about it was good.

To help you understand, here is a kind of type 2 fun that is more well-known than the Big Game: doing body-game-problems for many days in the cold to get on top of a very tall rock, and feeling very happy when you have reached the top, even though your body hurts a lot and you had to carry a small bag to use as a bathroom. It is no surprise that some people from this school love going up very tall rocks! (Though I know one group that would much rather only 
        go down tall rocks
      
, and another group that only likes to 
        go inside big rocks
      
.)

what this school’s type 2 fun is like

This school makes you think in new ways about using numbers, makes you think very hard about what you don’t know, and makes you work very hard all the time, ten times harder than you have ever worked before, even if you were already a very hard worker and everyone at home thought you had the biggest brain in the world. (Yes, I know this sounds very funny to hear in Up-Goer Five. 😒) In our number-studies, the problems are so strange that it can be hard to fit all the problem-pieces together just right to be sure you have the answer!

And even then, in real life, lots of other problem-pieces can be found in the world that make you have to change your answers and ways of doing. In all studies, but especially in studies of person-problems, it is very important to keep an open brain and not think you know everything 
        just because the pieces you hold happen to fit together
      
. There are many types of people in the world, all holding different problem-pieces and life-ways that you do not know well.

In the things we study at this school, there are some number-like-problems where no one in the whole world knows the answer yet. We call these “
        open problems
      
”. Sometimes teachers at this school even put small open problems at the end of normal home-work just to think about for fun! This school forces you to learn in strange and hard ways so that you can get good at finding new answers that no one knows yet.

When I was new to this school, in classes like 8.012 and 8.022, we did very strange number-problems that were not like anything I had thought about before, even though I was very good at high school classes and other-college classes about these ideas. We did number-problems such as figuring out how cars acted when moving almost as fast as light, while ON TOP of many other cars that were also all moving almost as fast as light. So strange! Do you see how problems like this are like the strange problems in the Big Game?

how Big Game “fun” is like the “fun” at this school

The Big Game is a “fun” “break” for me because it feels like work for this school, but faster and funnier. In the work world, we feel sad when we do a lot of hard work for many weeks or months to find problem-pieces and put them together, only to find that we have gone in a very wrong direction and need to start over. That is a kind of type 3 fun.

But in the Big Game, even though the game-problems are so hard they make our brains hurt a lot, they ALWAYS have an answer, because it is just a game. People like it when their hard work pays off. The Big Game feels like working at this school in a world where all the pieces are already in front of us, we know we will find answers in only a day instead of five years from now, and the answer-finding way is made to be fun. 😌

Also, type 2 fun is easier to have with friends. If you do something too hard without friends doing the thing with you, it can become type 3 fun.

This school has lots of type 2 fun. But without friendship, helping each other, and the type 1 fun we have together in our much-loved school-homes, it would turn into type 3 fun, and we would not want to be here any more. Even though it has been so long since I went to this school and I have made many amazing new friends since, many of the closest people in my heart are people from my school-home, which is the best place I have ever lived.

We love to build very strange things for type 1 or 2 fun at this school. When someone likes those things, they might make them again next year but even MORE strange or MORE fun. After many tens of years of this, our made-again things get so strange and fun that you will not find anything like them in the world. The Big Game is like that too, the way people make it again every year but build on it in strange new ways.

playing the Big Game feels different after this school

I played the Big Game a little bit while I was still at this school, but not seriously, and not all the way through. Back then, I was too busy learning other things and working hard all the time 🥲 Although this school does not say you must take classes or work during the first month of the year, I always did a lot of learning-work during this month anyway, because I love learning so much. The learning I did at this school was my favorite kind of learning. Sometimes (during other months) I did 90 hours a week of school work, and that was way too much. 50 hours of school work was an EASY week at this school.

Many people play the Big Game (or even write it!) while they are still at this school, and I love that for them. I wish I played it more in school. But there are reasons besides time why more people want to play the Big Game more seriously after finishing this school. At this school, we never ever stop doing hard brain-work! But after this school, the brain-work is easy, and we miss thinking hard. No kind of numbers-brain-work (besides things like the Big Game) is close to as interesting as the numbers-brain-work this school made us do.

I am too old now to do this school’s brain-work for 50 hours a week like I did when I was young. But I still want to do SOME brain-work that is too hard! I loved learning at this school, and The Big Game is my favorite way to fun-hurt my brain by thinking too hard the same way this school made me do. 🥰

who makes the Big Game?

If you finish the Big Game faster than anyone else, you are now in…a situation. The first-place team must make the next Big Game. In the 1980s, it was a small game started by one person, but then it got bigger and bigger. Now it has so many parts that it can become a whole job for many people working together for many months (although not the kind of job that gives you money).

In some ways, having to make the Big Game is like this year’s Big Game story, where the gods of the big-space-rocks sent us to hell and we had to escape from hell and help a dead god come back to life. (I am very surprised that “hell” is in the ten hundred most used words!)

Because the first-place team must do this hard and tiring thing, 
        most teams try to have fun, but do NOT try to finish first
      
. In fact, if a team has made the Big Game in the last few years, they are usually still so tired that they MAKE SURE they do NOT finish first.

…My team got first place this year! 🫠

this is the thing I was given for being on the first-place team! different ones are made every year, with story-memory pictures on them.

(Here is a place where you can see 
        the things given to the first-place teams
      
 in other years.)

My team has not been in first place for seven years, so we felt okay about maybe having to return to hell to make the Big Game again. The last time my team made the game was 2018. I decided not to write with my team then, because I was very busy that year and did not know the Big Game as well at the time, so I did not feel ready to make it. Now that the Big Game has been my favorite time of the year for so many years, I have a lot of ideas and a much better knowing of the little things that make it feel good, and I am very excited to help make it!!

Of course, I am also sure that once we make the next Big Game, I will not want to get first place again for a very long time.

Making the Big Game also makes you better at playing the Big Game, because you need to check and fix all kinds of broken game-problems, which is harder than just playing at only your favorite kinds of well-made game-problems. Last year, I enjoyed helping check a smaller big-game made for a numbers-fun-studying-place I went to when I was young.

sometimes, the Big Game is TOO BIG

Even though the Big Game is meant to be big, the Big Game can be TOO BIG. 40 years ago it was a small game, just some fun problems on one piece of paper that one person could do on their own. Over time, it got bigger. 2013 was the biggest Big Game of all time, so big that many players had to fly home before the end. Even the very best teams got scared by how big it was, and feared that it would never end.

The Big Game should not be TOO small, because tens of hundreds of people take time off work and fly all the way to this school just to play the game, and it would be sad if everyone only got to play for a few hours. In 2017, my team won the Big Game on the first day, which is not-heard of. My heart was broken because I could not take that day off work, and I missed our whole play-through, which I had been looking forward to all year. But it was not the game-making team’s fault. They wrote a number of problems that was normal-big for the Big Game, and that year was nice for some teams who got to see the end of the Big Game for the first time ever.

For the last two years, the Big Game has kept us up very late, past when it was supposed to end, and we got too tired and brain-dead to love it as much as we usually do. Even though I look forward to the Big Game all year, and there are few things I love more than hurting my brain by thinking too much about hard game-problems, I wished it was 12 hours shorter. It is fun to play the Big Game 16 hours a day for two days, but by late night on the third day, I get so tired I fall asleep in the middle of doing game-problems, right on top of my computer. At this point, I am no good at thinking any more. I like it when the Big Game ends before I pass out on the third night.

It is very, very hard to make a Big Game that is just right for everyone, not too big and not too small. My team is one of the strongest teams, so I have played to the end with them many times, but most teams do not get close to the end! I think it is sad when most teams only get to see a small piece of all the amazing work that comes from the hearts of many people who worked hard all year to make the Big Game happen.

Since lots of people liked the way my team made its last Big Game, I hope from deep in my heart that we can make a Big Game that is not TOO BIG, and one that can be lots of fun for everyone who loves game-problems, whether they are new to the Big Game or whether they have played many times.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fractals-and-torii-400x343.png

[Live Writing] MARC 2024,Andi Q. '25,0,2024-01-23T00:00:00-05:00,"January 23, 5:00 pm

Today is the first day of MARC 2024 (the Meeting about Amazingly-small Rocks and Computers), and I get to be there this year! MARC is two days of very bright people from MIT (Makers of Interesting Things) talking about all the cool ideas they have worked on for the past year. These ideas cover all sorts of different areas – faster computers, better ways to power those computers, and even new ways to save lives.

And then there’s me! I don’t have any of those kinds of ideas, but the good people running the meeting let me come along anyway. So now I get to hang out with these people who are much brighter than me and learn about the cool new ideas that are changing the world.

Of course, it’s not just all work and no play, so for the past six hours, we got to ride down the white stuff that fell from the sky. It was my second time ever doing this kind of stuff, but I quickly got the hang of it again and was even able to go quite fast without falling.

But now it’s almost time to start the actual meeting. And I will be back soon.

January 23, 10:00 pm

- Computers that still work when you light them on fire.

- Rocks that help computers remember things for longer.

- Very, very fast computers that only work when they’re very, very cold.

(I am almost definitely writing wrong about these ideas, but such is life when I can only use the top ten hundred words.)

The meeting started with the head person of MTL (MIT’s Tiny-thing Learning-place) telling us about all the new things that MTL had planned for the next few years. It was a fun talk, and it’s exciting how I’ll probably be a part of these new things this year.

In the middle of dinner, there was a short game where each table tried to build the tallest house using small sticks and soft sweets. They have this game every year at MARC, but I think the best table always builds the house in a new way. My table’s house was not the tallest, but it was sure fun to build.



At the end of the night, an important person from a big business that turns rocks into computers came and talked about the new things they were trying to make and why those things would change the world. I was surprised by this talk because these kinds of businesses are usually very tight-lipped about their work. (Although it makes sense here because MARC is probably a great place for them to find new people to work for them.)

January 24, 9:00 am

What exactly is MTL? They’re a group of people who study how to use small things to do big things. And I mean very small things – about as small to us as we are to the big brown ball turning around the sun.

When things get that small, weird stuff starts to happen. Like how if you throw a ball against a wall, it will always jump back to you; but if you throw a very, very small ball against a very, very small wall, then that ball sometimes goes right through the wall. (Actually, that’s one of the ideas behind how computers can remember things for a long time.)

MTL is 40 years old now, and they have been figuring out this kind of weird stuff for all that time. They’re one of the big reasons why it’s so great to learn about computers at MIT – because a lot of the stuff inside today’s computers was first made right here.

January 24, 9:45 am

The second day of the meeting started off with a short talk about a new space in MTL where students can work with the best new [things people use to build computers]. (I’ve seen the space before, and it is very nice and new inside – much nicer than the rest of MTL, actually.)

A lot of new stuff is being talked about this morning – there’s also a new business from MIT that makes it easier to write up plans for building computers (kind of… it’s hard to explain).

Right now, some bigger businesses are talking to us about why we should work for them. They all seem quite exciting, but it’s clear which one is the favorite at MTL:

“We’ll start with Draper! … and then go to the other three [businesses].”

“We’ll start with Draper! … and then go to the other three [businesses].”

The four businesses are:

- Draper (they do space stuff I think).

- Hitachi (I don’t know what they do).

- UpNano (they build a thing that lets you make very small 3D figures using light. We even have that thing at MIT!).

- NEC (I also don’t know what they do).

Some fun things that these businesses said:

“Have you ever done [small water work] with PDMS and hated it because nothing works?”

“Have you ever done [small water work] with PDMS and hated it because nothing works?”

(Yes, I have.)

“The good thing about us is that we have no [letting people go] planned. I think the plan is working well because he is still [someone who works with me]”

“The good thing about us is that we have no [letting people go] planned. I think the plan is working well because he is still [someone who works with me]”

(I guess this is a good way to get people to work for you.)



January 24, 10:30 am

Now, some people from four other businesses are talking to us about the uses of computers tomorrow (and the rocks used to make them). Many more different areas use computers these days, which is why they are suddenly so important now.

(They are talking a lot about working together being important, but I don’t know how possible that is because some of these businesses used to not like each other. Because money and stuff.)

January 24, 10:15 am

“Everyone just talks about AI these days.”

“Everyone just talks about AI these days.”

So true.

January 24, 11:00 am

Now we’re getting to the fun parts! Right now, students who are presenting their ideas are lining up to tell us about their ideas… except they only get 60 seconds to do so. Here’s what I think each one is about:

Part 1 (making the little doors inside computers)

- A smaller, easier way to sense [the not-red stuff in blood but not blood].

- Small computers that use little balls learn like brains (but better).

- Hot rocks and warm rocks.

- Non-binary computers.

- Using sticking-together rocks that don’t actually stick together to remember things.

- Hot computers that work in cars and up-goers

- Little computer doors that open and shut very quickly because they’re made of a new type of rock.

- AI and yet another computer door that opens and shuts quickly.

- Helping build cold and fast computers using warm and fast computers.

- Cool rocks for hot computers.

Part 2 (using the doors in Part 1 for not-computer things)

- Adding numbers faster with the power of Taylor Swift.

- Cleaning up the air waves.

- Making AI faster somehow.

- Like if (2) from Part 1 and (3) from Part 2 had a child.

- Making it less bad when things go very, very wrong.

- Sensing and using light from a bright rock for adding numbers.

Part 3 (living things and saving people in hospitals)

- Putting useful stuff into your body through your skin.

- A computer that makes you want to eat less.

- Using your phone to sense when your brain isn’t working well anymore.

- A better way to help people hear things.

- Powering computers using the small green things on trees.

- A computer that smells things as well as dogs can.

- Sensing if there is something wrong inside you without the doctor touching you.

- (I have no idea what this one is about, sorry.)

Part 4 (power!!!)

- Lower-power AI for seeing things.

- A thing for changing one type of power into another.

- Small moving computers that live for longer.

(If anyone who presented is here, I am so sorry you had to read this.)

January 24, 2:30 pm

Time for another talk by some businesses! This time, we have Analog Devices, Lam Research, and Soitech telling us about how they went from being students to being big, important people at big businesses.

In all, it’s a pretty great talk. They told us about why they decided to go work in businesses instead of staying in college, and how they started at those businesses. It was quite surprising to hear that they shared many of our struggles too, like not being able to find a job and things they tried not working out.

Hi Tyra

The “give me your money” guy was right – I definitely should give him my money for this wonder

The meeting is over now, and we got back to MIT two hours ago.  Even though writing about it was not fun at all, the rest of the two days were great, and I hope to go back again next year.

things i have done since leaving school,Nisha D. '21,3,2024-01-19T00:00:00-05:00,"~~~ cut off all my hair moved to city where the sun is out every day but it is still cold worked at a big place where people watch games on line and made bits go fast bought and killed some green things made new friends drank at bars decided that black is my best color played outside in the sun and in the cold played lots of games got back into hitting people with long sticks ate so much good food. sometimes even made my own flew on many air cars to places near and far enjoyed life by the day enjoyed doing nothing stopped enjoying doing nothing felt a bit sad and lost liked my job but not enough liked making a lot of money but not enough remembered the things i liked to do at school remembered the love for games that got me through life’s hardest parts decided to go back to big school to be a doctor in games computers and learning didn’t get into the big school where my boyfriend goes was very sad for a while cried many tears realized that the big school i got into would actually be better for me, but had to move away from the city that had become home cried more tears finally changed my arm skin bought a car. she looks weird but i love her left my computer job and moved to rain city with a friend from computer job now i think a lot about how games can be good for people write papers my old friends visit me from far away almost every week learn in class with new big school friends still hit people with sticks ran really far with my best friend my hair grew back",,0
How to train your sticking-together rock,Andi Q. '25,4,2024-01-17T00:00:00-05:00,"One of the coolest things about building and studying computers is taking rocks and training them to add and remember numbers. Wow! Rocks usually do not (and should not) know how to add or remember numbers, but we went ahead and made them do it anyway. Go humans!

But you know what’s even cooler than that? Training rocks… that STICK TOGETHER… to do those things too. That’s right – the same sticking-together rocks holding papers onto your cold-making box.

I like to think about sticking-together rocks because they are so weird and interesting. Why do they stick together? Why do other rocks not stick together? Why do so few people know how they work? So many questions, yet so few answers…

Anyway, let’s talk about how these strange rocks work and how we can turn them into computers!

How does a computer work?

I like to think of a computer as a big house with many doors, and cats walking through the open doors. Each door has a little guy controlling it, and the cats walking around the house can make the little guys open or shut their doors.

It’s like a cat door, except other cats control it

The cat can also make the door close

You can use these doors to control where the cats go in the house. Like this little house where cats will come out of room C only if either room A or room B don’t have cats.

Called a “not and” door

It turns out that you can use this “not and” door to do… well, a lot of things. Like adding numbers:

There must be so many cats in this house

Now just stick ten hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred of these doors in the house, and you’ll have yourself a full computer!

How do sticking-together rocks work?

Not all rocks can stick to other rocks or your cool-making box. Most rocks actually do not stick to other rocks (unless you try really hard), and some even push other rocks away.



 

Why does this happen? And where does this sticking-together force that we can’t see come from? To answer these questions, we have to look at a sticking-together rock up close.



Closer!



EVEN CLOSER!



Perfect.

This little piece of the rock is made of two parts: a big ball in the middle and many much smaller balls around it. (Except they’re more like waves than balls sometimes, but pretend that they’re balls for now.) These little balls cause little sticking-together forces in two ways:

- When they fly around the big ball. (Except they’re not really flying around. But it’s like they’re flying around.)

- When they turn very fast. (Except they’re not really turning, because if they were, then they’d be faster than light. But it’s like they’re turning.)

Do you see why sticking-together rocks are so weird now?

In most rocks, these little sticking-together forces point in different directions. Add them up, and you get no total force, so those rocks just sit there and do nothing. But in a few rocks, you can get those forces to point in the same direction and stay that way. Add them up, and you get a big sticking-together force!



It’s also possible for the forces to point up-down-up-down or even in a three-sided figure, but let’s now worry about these for now. I still don’t quite understand how these kinds of rocks work, and the words I’d need to explain them are really big and definitely in the no-no set of words.

Putting it all together

To make a computer door out of these sticking-together rocks, you need two of them next to each other. Remember how each rock has a force that points in one direction? Imagine now that you have two guys (instead of just one) controlling the door. If both of them push on the door, then it stays shut; but if one of them pulls instead, then the door opens.

So going back to our rocks, if they both point in one direction, then the door is open; else, it is shut! (This isn’t quite exactly what happens, but it’s the right idea.)



We could use this approach to add numbers using these rocks, but it’s usually much easier to use other rocks for that. So instead, we usually use sticking-together rocks to help computers remember numbers.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-drawing-13-400x370.png

"hello, after six years",Allan K. '17,4,2024-01-17T00:00:00-05:00,"i have been here and there, the last six years. i think a lot of people have felt this way, because of the way that many people got very sick and the world changed.",,0
take care of the boy from story who was put in water as a baby,Vincent H. '23,4,2024-01-17T00:00:00-05:00,"two years ago i wrote about how to walk in the best way. but i forgot to think about something important: the type and form of the foot. now i have lived longer, so i know more about the best way to walk, and i will tell you about it today

a few months ago i had a problem. the problem was about the boy from story who was put in water as a baby:



the good news is: the boy did not break (in fact it was not close to breaking either. i am just saying this because i do not want anyone to worry). however, the boy started feeling bad. it was tired from working too hard. part of this was because i was not walking in the best way, for several reasons

the first reason is something i wrote about last time. last time i said that each time you walk, you should put the back of the foot down first and roll over to the front of the foot. this is still true (for most people at least, now that i am old i realize body facts are never true for everyone). however, it is easy to do this wrong. it is easy to hit the ground too hard with the back of the foot, and if you do this many times a day for many days the back of the foot and the lower leg will wear down over time. the key is that when you hit the ground with the back of the foot, there should be very little heavy stuff on the back of the foot. you should wait for the rest of the foot to hit the ground before moving the heavy stuff over. if you do this well the foot does a very good rolling move that is not too heavy for the back of the foot



the next thing to look at is the type of the foot. if you look very hard at the picture above, you see that the bottom of the foot is not straight. this is important. straight bottom of the foot is not good. you can see in the next picture that if the bottom of the foot is too straight or too far from straight, it makes the lower leg lean a little



straight bottom of foot can be so bad that some people (but not that many, please do not worry about this if you do not have foot problems) need to wear shoes that help the foot be less straight, that way they avoid getting more heavy stuff on the lower leg, and the boy from story who was put in water as a baby can be less tired. make sure you keep a good foot type as you walk



this is also why it is good to keep the feet dry, and wrap them in dry clothes. many people have a voice in their brain (learned hundreds times hundreds of years ago) which says: when the foot is wet, raise the front of the foot and make the rest of it straight. if you walk with wet feet the voice in your brain may tell you to do things that you do not realize, and you may walk in a way different from normal, putting more heavy stuff on a part of the body that is not used to it. same thing if the ground is not straight, or if your foot is in pain or very tired. (this is the same idea as something i wrote last year, where i said that if one of your feet is in pain it is easy to move heavy stuff in a bad way to make that foot have less pain, and then the other foot will be in pain as well)

there are many other small things i have learned about good ways to walk. how the front of your foot should push off the ground a little. how to walk is more about the push off than the step forward. how to put less heavy stuff on the back of the foot you may need to make each step smaller. all of this is good for the boy from story who was put in water as a baby. but only using the ten hundred most used words is getting tiring and this is no longer my job so i am giving up now","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-15-at-9.07.14-AM-400x176.png

learning about Things!!,Audrey C. '24,3,2024-01-16T00:00:00-05:00,"After three and a half years of being at this school, I’ve taken quite a few classes. What have I even learned from them? I’m bad at remembering numbers (sometimes I forget my own phone number), but there were definitely cool ideas from my classes that have stuck with me. I also got to meet cool people through classes, who have pushed me to think in new ways. I know it’s easier to talk about liking a class when it’s over, but some classes I remember were fun even while I was taking them.

 How to Talk Better So People Listen More

We gave a lot of talks to get better at sharing our work in such a way that other people can easily understand and find interesting. Part of it is in how we explain things, like using too many hard words will make people lost. But explaining big ideas like you’re telling a story will make people care more and understand better. Another part of it is in how we talk — being excited when you talk, speaking loud and clear, not talking too quickly, can all add to your story. I often fear that when I talk, people aren’t actually listening, so I’m glad that there are real steps I can take to make people listen more.

2.678 How to Power Things to Make Things Happen Part 1

There are really small things that carry power over time. We can build small roads to control how these really small things move. These roads can also have parts that make less of the really small things move over time, can store and let go of [power over time], or change where the really small things are going. Building roads with the right parts is how we can use [power over time] to turn on lights, make things move, and make computers think and do things. I really liked the class when I took it, and last fall I got to help 
        run the class!
      


2.679 How to Power Things to Make Things Happen Part 2

This class builds off of How to Power Things to Make it Work Part 1, showing us more ways to build roads for really small things and more parts to add in the roads. Sometimes you need the really small things to carry power in ways that repeat or change over time. We learned how to use small computers to control how power is carried (and how to use power to control small computers) in Part 1, so Part 2 showed us more ways to do both! We also learned how to use computers to lay out roads that can be made again and again.

(I’m sorry if it hurt your brain to read about 2.678/2.679. I promise they are really good classes that I learned a lot from, but up goer five was not having it with so many of the important words used in these classes.)

6.115 Even More Cool Things About Small Computers

It turns out that small computers are made out of… smaller computers!! In these smaller computers there might be even smaller computers, but eventually you get down to small roads that carry really small things (as talked about in How to Power Things to Make Things Happen). This class looks at how the really small things can carry “words” that small computers can understand in the form of bits, and how smaller computers come together to carry out everything a small computer needs to be able to do (such as read, write, and store bits). If something isn’t working, you may look at the bits being written or read to see what’s going wrong. This class ate up SO much of my time, but understanding how exactly small computers work and how to fix things that aren’t working really opens up the world of building things that use power.

2.007 How to Build a Thing that Moves

This class was all about building a thing that we can drive to move! We need to make all of the different parts for the thing, put all the different parts together, power the thing, and (maybe) show that you can drive your thing better than everyone else. I learned so many different ways to make parts! I also learned the hard way that if you don’t think hard enough about the way you make the parts, it can be hard to put them together. Just because the thing works once doesn’t mean it will work again, so it was important to build the thing so that it can work again and again. But of course as it always goes, my thing decided to suddenly not work when it really mattered. Still, this class was so fun!

2.008 How to Make A Thing Many Many Times

In How to Build a Thing that Moves, we only had to build one of the thing. But if you want to make money from building things, it’s often important to make tens of hundreds of the same thing that all work the way you want it to! We really had to think about how each step of making a thing can be easily repeated. At the end of the class, we had to make five tens of a small thing that turns. If one of the steps to making the thing takes a bit more work, that “bit more work” adds up to be a lot of work if you have to repeat it five ten times.

2.737 How to Control a Thing that Moves

When you make a thing that moves, you may also need to think about how to make it move exactly how you want it to — this is called controls. This class focused on the type of controls where you look at how far off your thing is from where you want it to be. If your thing is very off, your thing should move a lot. But if your thing is pretty close, it only needs to move a little bit. You would use computers to decide how much to move the thing, but computers are never perfect at understanding how a real life thing moves. Sometimes not being perfect doesn’t matter, but other times it will throw your controls off and your thing won’t move at all how you want it to. In this class, we learned a lot about when it does matter for your computer’s understanding of the real life thing to be as close to perfect as possible.

6.8210 How to Control a Thing When You Don’t Know How Exactly It Should Move

Sometimes, especially if you want to build a thing that walks or does a back flip, you might not know how exactly to make that happen. Where should the thing move its leg and by how much? How should we consider all the ways the other legs can move? You can use a computer to figure out that out! You will need to tell a computer what it means to move in the best way (like maybe using as little power as possible, or landing on its feet as easily as possible, or both), and then the computer can find that best way.

9.53 Why Brains Are Better than Computers

Computers can do so many things so quickly, so sometimes we over look how cool brains are too. Babies only need to see a few pictures of a cat to know what a cat is, but computers need tens of hundreds of cat pictures to learn that a cat is not a dog.  A computer eats up the power used by Ice Land in a year to learn how to speak, way more power than what babies eat in a year. And babies learn how to speak all the same. With computers, you can look at bits to understand how the computer as a whole works. But you can’t just look at the small things that make up brains to understand why we walk, talk, think, and do all the cool things that we do so much more easily than computers. In this class, we looked at both computers and brains through this idea that maybe you don’t want to understand a big thing by looking at the small things by themselves, but instead through the way that smaller things can cause big changes when they work together.

9.85 How do Babies Learn Things

With babies, it might seem like there is not a single thought behind those eyes. But babies know way more than what you might expect! Babies learn how to talk when they are one year old, but there are ways to understand what younger babies are thinking even if they can’t say it yet. If a baby is surprised at something, they will look at it for longer. So if a baby is looking at something for longer, then you know that it’s not what the baby thought would happen. Then you can reason what the baby did think would happen. By understanding what babies know and how they think as they get older, we can then piece together how babies learn starting from the moment they are put into this world.

21W.762 Writing Words That are Beautiful

This was by far the most relaxing class I’ve taken at this school! Every class we would read our beautiful writing out loud one by one, and then everyone else would comment with what they thought about it. We did talk about forms, but it didn’t really matter if we followed them as long as we wrote something. I thought a lot about how to put words together in ways that were interesting, song-like, or not expected — it’s fun thinking about writing as an art.

21W.744 Writing for Picture Stories

I love picture stories!! Usually you’ll need to write the story before you add the drawing part, and this class focused on the writing. We really thought about how writing can be used to build the world the stories live in, drive the story forward, and make the people in the stories interesting. Stories only move forward if there is a reason for people to be mad at the world, at each other, or at their own self. It’s fun to write about people being mad at something, as it makes you figure out why the story world and the people living in it are the way they are.

21L.480 Reading Stories About People Who Are “Happy”

We read stories about girls who like girls, boys who like boys, people who are not boys or girls (who can like people too), about people who the world sees as different. These stories tell us why the world sees some people as different and how who we are, in all the different ways we can be, colors how we live. There can be pain that comes with the world seeing you as different, but people find ways to be happy as themselves anyways. And telling stories is an important part of that.

For the next two weeks we will all use fewer words here,Chris Peterson SM '13,3,2024-01-15T00:00:00-05:00,"It is a New Year now and I hope it is good for you.

Ten years ago this time we had a thing where the students who write for us, and also students who went to this school in the past and used to write for us, could write only in words besides the words that most people in this place use every day. People thought this was very good.

We now do this again, but different. From 1/15 to 1/31, the people who write here may write only using the ten hundred most used words. I told them they can write about whatever they want but they can only use these ten hundred words when they write.

This is harder than you might think, as was learned by a man who draws pictures with words that people like. He learned that this was hard with this picture that he made to teach about  goer five using only these words.



Over the next two weeks you will see many words — but also fewer kinds of them — from people who are still young and also some who are old now. They will tell you about their lives and things they do in same but different way and we hope you like to read them.",,0

10/13/23A graph from Controls. I don’t remember what lab this was from, but the orange was our desired behavior for our system, while blue was the behavior we were having. It got smoother after some time, so this probably was one of the better controllers we had during this lab,,,

10/14/23Bruh it is not that deep Damian please calm down,,,,,,

10/17/23Another strobe lab photo! We did bullet photography that week and used strobe techniques to take a picture of a bullet going through 3 candles. I found it really cool how the second candle looks like a ghost candle,,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/18/23Fall foliage outside Macgregor :) Around this time of year on campus, you could find every leaf color imaginable. I took a leaf off a tree somewhere else on campus and dried it out cause it was so pretty that I wanted to keep it ;-;,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/19/23A funny LinkedIn post for once :O,,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/20/23For controls, we used Matlab a fair bit for simplfying calculations. We were using it during a lab, so I took a screenshot of my screen for some reason, maybe to remember the values we were using.,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/21/23New tunnel mural! I don’t know when exactly this one went up, but I think it was pretty recent. As I said earlier, I loved Across the Spiderverse, so I was pretty hyped to see this mural.,,,

This is a hallway I know all too well. It is the 5th floor of Building 26, which I often use to get to the 5th floor of 38 (or 36, I honestly don’t know which one it is) since I have had a lot of classes there. I think I have had 6.08 (Embedded Systems), 6.002 (Circuits), and 6.302 (Controls) in that same area over the course of 3 semesters.,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/23/23A cute sign that I saw, you will never guess it, on my way to the 5th floor of Building 38 (or 36),,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/24/23I don’t find myself on the second floor of the Infinite much, so when I do, it reminds me that Lobby 7 has some cool architecture. I’m not the biggest fan of the current banners that hang there, but the building itself is nice.,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/25/23I’m in a fantasy league with some friends/acquaintances, and that week was looking to be a close one. I don’t remember if I won that week or not since I have had my fair share of losses. I think I’m currently sitting at .500, so I guess it could be worse.,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/26/23More pretty foliage :)), this time outside of E38,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/27/23I binged another show. This time I watched Pluto over the course of 2 days, which was about 8 hours of content. I saw this panel in the manga that resonated with me because of all the equations in the background and the character’s (Atom’s) look of O_O, so I drew myself into the panel.,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/28/23A few friends and I went to a frat party for Halloween, which was fun, but I was way too sleepy for it. My friend was dressed up as Emo Jimmy Butler, if you get the reference,,,

10/29/23Juice WRLD still be hitting with these relatable lyrics all these years later…,,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/30/23I went to a faculty-student dinner event! We went to the Mad Monkfish, a restaurant in Cambridge that specializes in sushi. I got a cool roll (for free >:)))) and got to hear about the professor’s research, work, and path to MIT,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
10/31/23For strobe lab (again), I designed and 3D printed a drill attachment for our final project. Our final project was dealing with making educational material for Magnetism classes, so we wanted to spin magnets using a drill and see how they interacted with iron filings & ferrofluid through the use of imaging techniques.,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/1/23Me :O, I wasn’t lying when I said my hair is longer than in my photo,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/2/23I have no clue what the context was for this, but I do recall I sent this to someone.,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/3/23An equation from Strobe Lab that I needed to reference. I am off from class, so I refuse to elaborate on what this equation means. I may have also forgotten what it means o_o,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/4/23My friend and I went to Newbury Street and got boba on a nice day. The place we were at had a nice angle with the Prudential building, so I took a picture that lined up with the street lamp.,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/5/23I got a food delivery, and the driver sent this picture to confirm my order arrived. I got my nourishment successfully :),,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/6/23If you didn’t get the Jimmy Butler reference earlier, this was what I was talking about. He basically trolled and wore an emo look to NBA Media Day so that we only see this picture for this season.,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/7/23On a board in Building 26 3rd floor, a group wrote this note. During the fall semester, we had an unusually high number of South Korean tour groups visiting MIT, which was very interesting to see,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/8/23I discovered a bug in Spotify, somehow. Also, I forgot to submit my information for the Blogger’s Spotify blog this year…,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/9/23Look how they did my boy momo dirty…,,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/10/23The milk drop photos from earlier! We colored some of the milk to make it more visible, which led to some cool shots.,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/11/23Another cool poster! Found in the Z center (the gym), featuring two beavers duking it out.,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/12/23My friends and I went to Quincy Market for fun, which was a nice way to get off campus. I had gone to Quincy Market only once before during my Sophomore year, so it was interesting to see the place much busier than it was during COVID times.,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/13/23A cool event that I forgot to go to until after it past :/,,,,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/14/23A senior tradition is Senior Sunrise, which is when the class gets up early to watch the sun rise over the Boston skyline. A surprisingly large share of our class came out, and as Class Council, we bought munchkins to share for the occasion.,,,
,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
11/15/23 – FinThis day was my birthday :), which means I turned __ years old (I did not forget to type it in)! My birthday is right before Thanksgiving, so I usually am pretty busy and don’t celebrate it too much cause of courseloads :/. I still got to have a good time with some friends and mess around for a bit though. I wanted to treat myself to buying these kicks, but I could no longer find them on the Nike store :(. I did wind up buying a different black and blue pair a few days later, which I guess counts as a present to myself still :),,

Uncanny Valley,Anika H. '26,7,2024-01-14T00:00:00-05:00,"Uncanny valley is a phenomenon where an eerie and unsettling feeling arises when looking at something human-like. This is why humanoid robots, zombies, corpses, and occasionally anthropomorphic animals may sometimes feel a little creepy. On a graph of human likeness to attraction/repulsion, uncanny valley refers to the sharp dip. There are several theories about why we evolved this way. Some people think it helped us identify the diseased and dead while others think it implies the existence of a predator that mimicked humans to get closer to us. Whatever the case, this topic hasn’t been explored much with scientific rigor and simply remains at best a collection of observations.

a graphical representation

What I’ve noticed is that uncanny valley happens when there is a mismatch between human and nonhuman features. The nonhuman movement of an android and its human-like features or a humanoid creature with abnormally long arms and legs will both appear creepy. So as any self respecting artist would do, I sought to exploit this behavior. As they say, it’s now a feature, not a bug.

This is part 2 of using my art powers for chaos.

So how do you give someone the heebie jeebies with your art? Starting off faithful to the human likeness, simply change its proportions ever so slightly. This includes lengthening facial features or shortening the distance between them, and increasing or decreasing the depth of folds with increased or decreased shading of the shadows.

a small example/tutorial

Make it smile! Smiles become unsettling when they seem insincere. While an angry or fearful expression appears scary, a smile in a different context from what we are used to can really screw with our brain’s perception of emotion. Therefore, I picked the happiest people I know to model for my drawings: the bloggers! Here are a few examples of the poor souls who sacrificed their dignity for my creative exploitations.

“You are capable of more than you know.”,Jeremy W.,2,2024-01-13T00:00:00-05:00,"Leading our transfer admissions program is one of the greatest joys of my work at MIT. Each year, we welcome a small group of transfer students to the Institute, and each year they surprise and inspire me. The real magic of the transfer process is that no two transfer students follow the same path to MIT. Colored by the patina of life experience, transfer students contour the MIT community in unexpected ways.

MIT transfer students hail from every corner of the globe: New Zealand to New York City; India to Indiana; Cambridge, UK to Cambridge, MA. Our transfer students are not only great students—they are distinguished researchers, small business owners, artists, parents, and more.

Many students transfer to MIT from community colleges, and others find their way to MIT from private, public, and international universities. Some took a so-called “non-traditional” route (for example, opting to put their education on pause to compete in the Olympic Games and earn medals, or to serve the nation in the U.S. Armed Forces). I am fortunate enough to know all of our current transfer students, and all of them are exceptional.

As a way to share a glimpse into our transfer community with the blogs, I asked 
        last year’s transfer cohort
      
to reflect on their experience. I’m sharing the responses of six students to four survey questions, which have been minimally edited for clarity.

Here are the basic details for each of the six transfer students:

Gaurab

- Previous institution: Purdue University (West Lafayette, IN)

- MIT major: 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)

Amanda

- Previous institution: Wellesley College (Wellesley, MA)

- MIT major: 11 (Urban Studies and Planning)

Janet

- Previous institution: Pasadena City College (Pasadena, CA)

- MIT major: 10-ENG (Chemical Engineering)

Krithik

- Previous institution: The University of Auckland (Auckland, New Zealand)

- MIT major: 6-4 (Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making)

Subin

- Previous institution: Northern Virginia Community College (Annandale, VA)

- MIT major: 6-4 (Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making)

Luana

- Previous institution: Union County College (Union County, NJ)

- MIT major: 2A-6 (Mechanical Engineering: Control, Instrumentation and Robotics)

I. The Before Times

Before you decided to transfer to MIT, who were you, and what were you up to?

Gaurab:

I lived most of my life in India and spent a lot of time preparing for the JEEs, an Indian engineering exam. I thought I would go to a school in India for the longest time, but I ended up going to Purdue because my family moved to the US. I intended to do Computer Engineering at Purdue, and was involved in ML research, IEEE societies and the table tennis club.

Amanda:

In the jumble of my first year at Wellesley, COVID, and feeling just a little out of place, I remember trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted to do, and what fulfilled me academically, professionally, and personally. I was involved on campus, taking on roles in my dorm and in clubs, and found a strong interest in and love for economics.

Janet:

Before I decided to transfer to MIT, I was a community college student pursuing chemical engineering. Outside of class, I devoted most of my time to scientific research, trying to get a clear picture of what I wanted career-wise. I was involved in clubs on campus and tutored at the STEM center.

Krithik:

Before MIT, I was studying Computer Science and Molecular Biology in an Honors Program at the University of Auckland halfway across the world in New Zealand. I was really excited to experience what life outside of America was like, and gain a new perspective on research and broaden academic journey; (It was awesome and dorm looked out onto the Auckland Bay, absolutely surreal). During COVID, while waiting for the New Zealand borders to open up, I was a group fitness instructor at a spin class-esque studio that used Concept2 Ergs called RowHouse back in my home town of Denver, Colorado. I got more into Formula 1 racing simulators and logged an obscene amount of hours on racing rig (Go McLaren—although they aren’t doing that well).

Subin:

During my enlisted time in the U.S Army, I had a clear vision for my future: go to college and major in computer science. While this aspect was unquestionable, the intricacies of its academic demands remained mysterious, as I have had no exposure to this field. It was only after completing my military service that I fully grasped the challenges that lay ahead in life, and in order to be successful, I had to heighten the level of dedication and effort. And so I did.

Luana:

Before transferring to MIT, I pursued a sophomore year in Mechanical Engineering at Union College, where I also engaged actively in sports. My athletic involvement included CrossFit, track and field, and cross-country. Simultaneously, I balanced a full-time position at a wine importer’s office and managed my own business.

II. Applying to MIT

Walk us briefly through your transfer application process to MIT. Why did you decide to apply? Were there any notable challenges or highlights?

Gaurab:

I decided I wanted to apply during my Freshman Fall. However, I started liking Purdue more and more during the Spring which made me question why I wanted to transfer in the first place. I ended up deciding to apply because I had a feeling I would fit in well at MIT and wanted to challenge myself a bit more. A challenge I faced was applying in the midst of assignment deadlines and midterm seasons—college is definitely more hectic than high school for me.

Amanda:

I was greatly warned of the challenges with Wellesley and MIT’s dual-degree program in my sophomore year—class schedules would be intense, diligent planning would be necessary to complete requirements in five years, and MIT would be hard to get into (duh). But at some point, I decided to take a chance. After all, MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning offered such niche and interesting classes, and I believed a combination of liberal arts and technical training to be the best path for me to explore questions relating to sustainability, policy, and markets. The process forced me to really ask myself what I hoped to accomplish in the next few years and how MIT could be a stepping stone in that direction. And while I mulled over the application for weeks, it was the first time I truthfully reflected on what fulfilled me and why.

Janet:

After my community college professor encouraged me, I figured, why not apply to MIT? Honestly, it never seemed like a real option before because I didn’t think I’d get accepted. But once I decided to apply, the real struggle was juggling my time to keep up with both the transfer application and my regular schoolwork.

Krithik:

At the time I applied, I had completed most of the notable computer science coursework available at the University of Auckland. While in New Zealand, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with the Centre for Computational Evolution (CCE), who published seminal work in computational phylogenetics, and with the Sabeti Lab, an infectious disease lab at the Broad Institute, working on similar problems on outbreak reconstruction. 
        My mentors in New Zealand,
      
and my advisors at the Broad suggested that I apply to MIT for transfer to get more opportunities in research and have the ability to take more specialized classes in math and computer science—and be closer to my new lab at the Broad. So I opened my application around mid-summer, which is the start of first semester in New Zealand.

Subin:

During my first year at Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC), I was gathering a list of schools I wanted to submit the applications to. Through talking to my friends, mentors, and academic advisors, I was inspired to aim high, despite the uncertainties of the outcome. The most challenging part was crafting the personal essays. Meticulously refining the “perfect” message that I wanted to communicate through the given prompts.

Luana:

In November 2021, I began the process of applying to MIT. This early start provided me with sufficient time to deeply explore my interests at MIT and carefully refine my application responses. As part of a larger exploration of the U.S. college landscape, I applied to ten institutions in total, a period marked by significant introspection. The MIT application, which was the first one I began and completed, led me to an unexpected journey of self-discovery. Over the three months, I realized my profound desire for success and recognized the extensive efforts I had put forth to reach my current position.

During this time, Mrs. Diana, my athletic supervisor and a dear friend who is an avid reader, played a pivotal role. She meticulously reviewed all my essays, helping me improve any English mistakes. Her reaction to my acceptance on March 14th was emotional; she shed tears of joy. Interestingly, she noted that my technical essay discussing my academic and career goals had few grammar errors, while essays about my persona, where I shared my thoughts and feelings, required more corrections. This observation highlighted a disconnection: it seemed I hadn’t devoted as much time to understanding my own emotions as I had to outline my academic ambitions. This completely changed after MIT.

III: You’re an MIT Student Now

Now that you’re at MIT, who are you, and what are you up to?

Gaurab:

I’m a junior at MIT majoring in EECS. I do hardware cryptography research for my SuperUROP, and help organize Pokerbots every IAP.

I am a brother at Phi Kappa Theta, and have been on the teaching staff as an LA for some Course 6 classes. In my free time, I love playing table tennis at Simmons, psetting with friends and staring at the Dome.

Amanda:

In my short 1.5 years at MIT, I am happy to reflect on all the memories I’ve made, from joining the lightweight women’s crew team to TAing classes to helping with transfer orientation. Most of my days now revolve around practice, class, work in the Admissions Office, and meals with friends I’ve made in clubs and in my sorority. 4pm sunsets in Boston are never fun, but they are made richer knowing that community can form in a short amount of time, it’s just a matter of seeking it out.

Janet:

At MIT, I am majoring in Chemical Engineering with a concentration in computing. I am involved in the department through UROPs and as a student lead/representative. Outside of school, I love going on food adventures in Boston/Cambridge.

Krithik:

MIT lives up to its reputation of drinking from the fire hose, and I definitely got inundated with all the awesome (and stressful) parts of MIT. I live in New Vassar (best dorm), and this semester I’m taking a classes like statistical learning theory at MIT and small molecule biophysics (via cross-registration at Harvard). I still work at the Broad Institute in the Sabeti Lab, now working on more deep learning ideas, and joined the Student Events Board (SEB) which runs our annual concert SpringFest!

Subin:

I’ve managed to strike a reasonably balanced lifestyle between my academic pursuits and personal life. It is continuously amazing to find out new areas for improvements for both aspects. Generally, I find most days enjoyable, with the exception of those few nights when homework deadlines lurk around the corner.

Luana:

I recently wrapped up my third semester at MIT. Opting for more privacy and space, I moved to Tang Hall, leaving Maseeh Hall after two semesters. My previous semester involved engaging in a UROP, where I honed my skills in CAD and mechatronics. In addition to my academic pursuits, I hold the position of treasurer in the Transfer Students Association.

Recognizing the intensity of my course load in the past two terms and after speaking with my thermo-fluids professor and the MechE academic administrator, I’ve decided to adjust my schedule. Moving forward, I plan to enroll in just two technical courses along with a HASS or elective each semester. This decision stems from my desire to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects, rather than just managing problem sets one after another. Additionally, this approach will support my commitment to maintaining physical health through regular exercise.

IV. Looking Back

Think back to the person you were before you began the transfer process. What do you wish that version of you knew that you know now?

Gaurab:

It’s been a crazy sequence of events since before I began the transfer process—I would have never expected to be where I am. I wish the younger me worried less about the far-off future and focused more on the present, because time moves so fast in college. I’ve definitely grown, not only academically, but also as a person in an overall sense, and I feel more like an adult now. My interests haven’t changed a lot—I still love computers!

Amanda:

(1) You are capable of more than you know and (2) being your true self and embracing genuine passions will allow you to fully blossom. I am still interested in the questions and fields I came in exploring, but my mindset has shifted slightly.

I’ve learned to drop some perfectionist tendencies (although admittedly, this is a work in progress); work with high expectations but understand when something is good enough; and be present in the moment, there won’t be another time like this.

Janet:

Looking back, I really wish I had more faith in myself and believed that things would work out okay. After spending over a year at MIT, my academic focus has shifted more towards computing, though I’m still in the process of pinning down exactly what my career goals are.

Krithik:

I think the best advice I could have given New Zealand Krithik was to really enjoy the time you spend in undergrad wherever you are—whether that was in Auckland, or if you were lucky enough to get into MIT. I think I’ve grown a lot most notably in learning how to think about problems from my peers, approaching problems with evidence, engineering, and most importantly, empathy. People at MIT are super friendly and spontaneous and always willing to lend a hand.

I think my goals have shifted more broadly to learning more foundational ideas in mathematics as it relates to machine learning, asking questions like, “Can we move past transformers as a method of representing the world in AI models and find more expressive, efficient solutions?”

Subin:

Not much has changed; there are areas where I’m shining with exceptional skills, and there are many others where I see room for improvement and growth. I am happy to tackle those challenges head-on.

Luana:

Initially, the prospect of attending MIT was daunting and almost surreal. Yet, as I navigated through, I realized there was little to fear. The supportive network of professors, counselors, and friends has been invaluable in clarifying my path. This journey has bolstered my confidence, especially in embracing new and intimidating ventures. Unexpectedly, coding, once a distant concept as a Mechanical Engineering student, has sparked a newfound passion.

This shift occurred after an internship at Boeing, where I engaged in coding for an automation inspection project. Consequently, I transitioned from course 2 to 2A-6, a decision that has brought immense satisfaction and excitement for the plethora of opportunities now within my reach.

My goals have evolved remarkably. With my newfound coding prowess, I am now contemplating innovative ventures, possibly even launching a product with some talented friends I’ve met here at MIT. It’s a testament to how much one can grow and discover new passions in such a dynamic environment.

I want to thank Gaurab, Amanda, Janet, Krithik, Subin, and Luana for willingness to share your stories with me and the blogs. You—and all transfer students—are an integral part of making MIT the special place that it is.",,0
In which I “get a life” again,Allison E. '27,1,2024-01-12T00:00:00-05:00,"Over this past summer, I spent a lot of time filling out all of those “get to know you” forms for roommates and advisors and whatever other MIT things were coming up. It was so exciting—MIT things!! They were already beginning!! We were going to college!! I obsessed over my answers to every question, as if I’d never snapped out of the trance of college apps, and one of the most common ones I noticed was “what are your hobbies?” 

But there was a problem with this question. I didn’t have any hobbies.

That was kind of sad to think about for a while. Really, Allison? You have no hobbies?? As hard as I tried to think, I couldn’t come up with anything. Sewing? Not consistent enough. Running? Not something I did for fun. Watching YouTube? That’s… that doesn’t count, right?

Of course, there were plenty of things I did in high school that brought me joy, fulfillment, and a sense of identity. Despite what the title of this post implies, 
        hobbies
      
 are DEFINITELY NOT NECESSARY for being an Interesting Person™. But they’re definitely fun, and they’re definitely a great way to connect with other people (hence the frequency in get-to-know-you questionnaires), so I was still a little disappointed that I didn’t have anything to share.

In elementary school, I was really into arts & crafts—particularly those little novelty kits you could find at Michaels or Joann’s. I made friendship bracelets, string art, shrinky dinks, window stickers, clay charms, and even mini stuffed fruit plushies. Then, when I was in fourth grade, my best friend and I learned how to knit. It was a \ funny hobby for two fourth graders to have, since knitting is usually something you imagine your grandma doing as she sits by the fire on a cold winter’s night. But we started! And then we would not stop. At the beginning of sleepovers we’d build a blanket fort, and then we’d spend the next four hours just sitting inside them and knitting (while watching DanTDM videos, of course). I brought my yarn and needles with me everywhere—in the car on grocery trips, to friends’ houses, and even on a 
        plane??
      


When my family moved just before I started middle school, I brought a massive bag of all the yarn I owned along with us. And then I proceeded to not touch it for seven years. I thought about picking knitting back up again, but believed I’d never have the time to actually finish a project—it just seemed too time-intensive. There were always “better” things to do (or YouTube videos to watch), so by the time I got to MIT, I hadn’t picked up my needles for a loooong time.

One day, though, I was in the Admission Office waiting for my first-year seminar to start, when I noticed that yarn and knitting needles were scattered throughout a little lounge area off to the side. I walked over to take a closer look. There was a little placard on the wallnoting that this lounge was in honor of an admissions officer named Gisel, who loved to knit. And because I definitely had no psets at all to do, I picked up a pair of needles and a ball of yarn that was identical to the yarn I used to use, and knitted a completely useless square. Two weeks and one Michaels purchase later, I had a couple balls of yarn, some needles, and a rekindled obsession.

Because holy cow, I forgot how fun knitting is. It’s so incredibly satisfying to watch your project grow from a few loops of yarn to an actual wearable item, and I really enjoy understanding how all the different stitches work together to create a pattern—it’s like a puzzle! Over the last couple months, I’ve knit ¼ of a poorly thought out cardigan, a massive scarf that sheds red fuzz on everything it touchs, ⅓ of a weird hood thing, an entire throw blanket, and a very oversized cowl. It’s extra exciting because I’m finally back in a place where I need scarves and hats, and now I can make them myself!

My dad thinks it’s odd that I’m rediscovering hobbies in college, which is notoriously more busy than ever, but knitting has actually been a pretty sustainable hobby time-wise. It’s actually quite easy to multi-task—I can knit while watching Open CourseWare biology videos, or while talking with friends at 3 am. It doesn’t really require major brain engagement, and for simple patterns I can even look up most of the time. Ultimate productivity unlocked !!!!

I do want to avoid tying my feelings of self-worth to my economic productivity, and I think I’ve actually gotten better at it in the last few months. I’m not all the way there yet—it’s discouraging sometimes to see how much the people around me are getting done, how many clubs they’re a part of, or how well they’re able to maintain good sleep schedules. But multitasking with knitting has actually been a great way to trick my brain into feeling less bad about doing fun things just for myself. I can enjoy my YouTube videos and talk for hours with my friends without beating myself up about “getting things done” because, in fact, I am getting things done! I’m making gifts for my family or scarves for winter, while also producing joy for myself.

I’m very happy to report that college has not squeezed the life out of my life (at least… it hasn’t so far?), and in fact, it’s actually added some much needed life back in. 

There’s only one issue—one that’s re-emerged from the depths of my elementary school room and crawled its way into my dorm. It’s the yarn monster. It is growing. It is consuming the space in my drawers and the money in my wallet. It is coming for me at an alarming pace. Please send help.",,0
"How Albatross Fly Without Flapping Their Wings,",Kayode D. '27,3,2024-01-10T00:00:00-05:00,"[HEY! NOTE: If you are looking for the real, scientific reason of how albatross fly, this is probably not the place to look. I give an explanation, but my source is my professor telling me and like a quick google search. If you are looking for a credible source, try using this link here. If you don’t care for citation and just wanna know, I explain it below!]

…

This blog is a long time coming. I initially anticipated making this on like week 3 to share some neat things I learned this semester and share some silly stories, but kept learning and experiencing things, so here’s a full semester’s worth of cool things, none of which are particularly applicable or useful, but there you go. 

Albatross Lore

For a good portion of my time in 
        8.01
      
I was failing. That’s why I dropped to 
        8.01L
      
 but that’s a story for another time. The thing I remember most from my time in 8.01 was something the professor taught us in the first few weeks. It has virtually no application to me or my life, and I will probably never use it as long as I live, but it was interesting to learn. 

When he first introduced this topic, he claimed to have “a problem that had yet to be solved,” which immediately peaked my interest. This was the kind of thing I came to MIT to learn about!

This has to do with Albatross, a large bird with a 11 foot wingspan predominantly found in the southern hemisphere that spends 90% of its life in the air. An Albatross can go up to 6 years before returning to the island it was born on to mate and lay eggs. They hunt, eat, and sleep, all while in the air, occasionally landing in the water. But somehow, despite spending most of their lives in the air, Albatross don’t flap their wings. 

This isn’t even the craziest part– Pterodactyls and Quezocatlus, two prehistoric flying dinosaurs the size of giraffes with wingspans up to 36 feet wide, were thought to have flown the same way! So how did they do it? 

By gliding, or rather, “Dynamic Soaring”. Winds over the ocean are stronger, and by flying in a zig-zagging pattern, Albatross can use updrafts to gain speed and height. Using their large wingspans as a sort of sail, and angling the feathers on each wing’s end to turn, Albatross can gain lots of momentum and fly long distances without using much energy at all. And by locking their wings, they can rest and sleep in the air, meaning they can spend years without having to go to dry land. 

If this method of flight could be harnessed in a drone or flying vehicle, large distances could be traveled without using much fuel. I just thought this was a really cool thing that I didn’t know about before MIT. 

 

The Black Squirrel Situation:

After sharing my neat albatross facts at a blogger meeting early in the semester, I left the admissions office for the long trek back to Simmons Hall. I walked and talked with Amber V., and she shared some of the early developments of her 2.009 project. After splitting at a fork in the road, I saw something on a tree on Massachusetts Avenue, outside of the main campus building. 

It was a black squirrel. I was shocked! I immediate thought was “huh, it’s like 
        a shiny pokemon
      
“. I had never seen a black squirrel before, and started to wonder if it was like an albino animal and was extremely rare. I almost pulled out my phone to take a picture, but decided not to. It’s only a black animal, and cats and dogs are black all of the time! Also, my phone was at 3% battery and I didn’t want to waste its last few moments taking a picture of a common animal. I watched it scamper away up the tree. 

And then curiosity got the best of me and I looked up how rare it was. I’d seen grey and brown squirrels in Kentucky, and for some reason a black squirrel just looked so odd to me. 

1 in 10,000. Black squirrels are 1 in 10,000. A .01% chance of spotting one and I didn’t take a picture! They’re also only found in northern areas, which explains why I hadn’t seen any before in Kentucky. I frantically swapped to the camera app and took this blurry picture of a black blob on a tree branch: 

 

This is my furry blob of a black squirrel.

 

I got back to my dorm and texted the admissions groupchat to tell this story, and was informed about how common they were on MIT Campus. But somehow, despite how “common” they are, I have yet to see another black squirrel in all of my time here. I’ve seen a lot of rabbits and some gray squirrels but not a single black one. My friends don’t let me forget this, and text me photos and videos whenever they see one, just to rub it in. 

 

 

The Fosbury Flop 

This is something I learned in my NEW physics class, 8.01L (Physics LONG), and I thought it was really cool. It’s a technique for high jump that involves arching the back so that the jumper’s centre of mass travels underneath the high jump bar. 

This is the video we watched in class and I think it does a better job explaining the Fosbury Flop than I ever could. 

 

Rapid Fire Lore that I think is cool but wouldn’t commit a whole section to: 

- Microwaves are the size that they are because that is the size of a Microwave. Like, the wavelength of the microwave that heats up your food wouldn’t do it’s job if you made the microwave bigger. 

- Pineapple has flesh-eating enzymes in it that eat proteins off of your tongue, and this can make it feel like it’s burning your mouth. That, or MIT pineapple is just really, REALLY sour. 

- In swimming, there’s a competition category called “Freestyle” where you can use any officially-regulated swimming technique you want. I didn’t know this because everyone uses the same technique, called the front stroke. I figured this was just called the freestyle technique, but no, it’s called the front crawl and is the fastest swimming technique, so everyone just uses it. (I learned this in my swim class) 

- The idea of “No Elbows on the Table!” stems from when tables only had middle supports, and leaning on the edge would cause the table to flip over. So when my dad scolded 8-year-old me in a Chili’s, I should’ve just flipped the table on him. 

- Horse feet are just fingers. The hoof is just like the last link of your middle finger, except it’s much bigger on a horse. Horses are born with hooves, and over time they turn into the kind you see on adult horses, although they initially don’t look anything like it. If you look up “baby horse feet” you can see it for yourself (it’s like if your fingers each had 20 fingers at the end).

 

SPREADING MISINFORMATION ON THE INTERNET ALERT!!!

Please take this with a grain of salt. I heard this 5th hand and now run the risk of spreading misinformation on the internet. It just sounded like a really cool thing and wanted to share:

Cambridge has a higher rabbit population than one would expect, and I see rabbits just about every day on my walk to classes in the mornings. 

Apparently (and I looked and could find NO evidence to support this claim!) MIT’s main campus and Massachusetts Avenue is so massive that they act as an evolutionary barrier for rabbits, and the physical separation results in genetic drift between the east campus and west campus rabbits. Apparently this was a UROP done by someone in the past, but I have yet to find any evidence to back up my unsubstantiated claim. 

But think about it– have you ever seen a rabbit cross Mass Ave? Just consider it a Rock Fact! 

 

Anyways, that’s a whole semester of Lore™️ that will never benefit me in any meaningful way or contribute to society! Now don’t ask me about molecular orbital theory or how to build a buffer, because I definitely don’t remember.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Albatross-1.png

welding spiels,Audrey C. '24,2,2024-01-09T00:00:00-05:00,"One of my favorite places on campus is the Metropolis makerspace. It’s where I learned how to 3D print, lasercut, weld, and fiddle with electronics. It’s where I realized that I can too can be a “maker,” that makery skills are learnable with the help and support from the community. I really appreciate the commitment Metropolis (and its sister shop The Deep) have put forth towards making, well, making as accessible to the MIT community as possible.

Kind of a tangent, but I want to shout out the fact that Metropolis has also been investing more supplies and equipment towards what’s typically classified as “craft.” This includes embroidering, quilting, crochet, linocut printing, screenprinting, and stained glass. While I’ve loved clothing alterations and drawing all my life, why haven’t I been able call myself a maker until I’ve learned how to operate heavy machinery? I feel like broader maker culture devalues craft as less hardcore and less cerebral compared to stuff like CNC machining. Yet craft requires creativity and getting your hands dirty all the same. There’s undeniably a gendered aspect to how crafting has historically been relegated as a frivolous feminine pastime. Anyways, I’m glad that Metropolis is legitimizing craft as a Real and Cool form of making. I can speak on Metropolis/The Deep because I’m most familiar with them, but many other makerspaces on campus similarly operate under the idea that everyone is a maker.

patches i designed during a screenprinting workshop at Metropolis

Mentors, who are student volunteers, have helped me out a ton when I was starting out, so I signed up to do the same for others last year. Within the blogger team, Kano, Anika, and Gloria also mentor for Metropolis! It’s a pretty good gig. We’re typically responsible for running one open hours session and one equipment training session each week. During open hours, MIT community members can come in, work on their thing, and have mentors/staff around to ask for help. In order to learn how to use the makerspace equipment or learn a new skill, people can sign up for training sessions.

we got these super cute polaroids with magnets to signify what people should poke us about!

This past semester, I’ve been running 
        MIG
      
 welding trainings as my weekly equipment training. Aside from welding being a useful skill (it’s the strongest way to join two pieces of metal), there’s a bit of an art to the technique. I learned how to weld about two years ago to make some steel spinning props (that I have yet to finish, oops). Since then, I’ve gotten more practice through random personal projects that I did actually finish and through informally teaching my friends how to weld. I thought, I might as well formalize this. My friend Isabella is an Established Welding Mentor, so I shadowed her for a few sessions before running my own.

It turned out that a TON of people wanted to learn how to weld. It got to the point where people would ask Isabella and I if there was any way we could squeeze them in, despite all of our scheduled trainings being at capacity. We eventually both swapped out our open hour shifts for MIG welding trainings to double the number of people we could train each week. Even then, demand remained overwhelming. I ran a few extra impromptu trainings if people asked nicely.

This is all to say, that after repeating the welding training spiel two or even three times a week for a semester, it’s been seared into my memory. I might as well dump my training spiels here on my little corner of the Internet.

While I am but a wee hobbyist who can weld well enough to keep my silly little projects together, it’s a skill that people master after years of training through trade school or apprenticeships. I’m sure there’s more precise technique if you’re welding something professionally or higher stakes, like a rollercoaster frame. But for now I hope I can share with you the joy of melty metal.

Let’s begin the training. I introduce myself — I’m Audrey, and I like to weld for funsies. I ask the people here for the training to also introduce themselves and share any particular motivation for learning how to weld. Especially towards the end of the semester, most of the attendees needed to learn welding as a prerequisite for the IAP class where you build a bike. Others wanted to be able to stick together metal for MechE classes, architecture/design classes, aeroastro research, and of course, for funsies.

We make our way to the rack of safety glasses and put them on. They’ll protect our eyes against the hot metal sparks that welding torch sprays everywhere. Even though we’ll wear a welding helmet that will cover our face, there’s still a chance of sparks flying under the helmet and into our eyes. There’s been reported cases where welders who don’t regularly wear safety glasses go in for an MRI and have metal fragments embedded in their eyeballs vibrate, heat up, or even move around… Even though that’s highly unlikely to happen for the average MIT student who likely isn’t welding throughout their 9-5, safety glasses make our chances as close to zero as possible.



We peek inside the hotworks room through the orange UV protective windows on the door, just to make sure no one is already welding. If someone is working in there, you’d knock to get their attention before you walk in, since accidentally looking at the intense welding arc with naked eyes would not be fun. I point out the vinyl cut words on the back door as a summary for safety considerations:



- HOT: freshly welded things are HOT. You’re literally melting metal to stick them together. Most burns don’t happen during the actual welding, as you’ll be wearing thick protective gloves. Instead, people tend to burn themselves when they take off their gloves to 
        sand
      
 down a freshly welded piece.

- SHARP: metal is SHARP right after you cut it. We can get rid of sharp edges by sanding it down or using a deburring tool.

- BRIGHT: welding arcs are BRIGHT. They’re super intense and emit a ton of UV radiation, which is why we wear helmets with self darkening visors to protect our eyes. According to reddit, it’s 
        “fine”
      
 if you accidentally weld without your helmet once, but prolonged exposure could permanently scar your corneas.

- LOUD: all the equipment we use to cut/sand metal are very LOUD. People who work in machine shops tend to lose their hearing at an earlier age than the average population, but wearing hearing protection can spare you from that fate.

- HEAVY: metal, especially hunks of steel, is HEAVY. Always wear closed toed shoes in the hotworks room, as dropping a piece of metal on your shoe hurts less than on your naked toes. On a similar note, I see that everyone’s also wearing long pants as instructed, so we don’t have to bring out the Pants of Shame.

- FUMES: depending on who you ask, MIG in MIG welding stands for Metal Inert Gas or Mixed Inert Gas. The point is that there’s an inert gas involved, and it can get quite smelly and uncomfy. We’ll turn the fume extractor exhausts on to limit our exposure to the gas.

As the fume extractors gradually whirr to life, we can set up the welding machine. I point out the one that we’ll use today: the steel MIG welder. It does have an aluminum setting, but from experience, it sucks. The wonderful shop staff recently purchased a fancy MIG welder specifically for aluminum, which uses fairly similar technique as the steel MIG welder with a few additional quirks. Sandwiched between the MIG welders are the TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding machines.



What’s the difference, you may ask? MIG is like using a fancy hot glue gun, where you press a trigger on the welding torch. The filler wire automatically extrudes from the torch and melts into a joint, just like hot glue. TIG is akin to soldering, where you hold the torch with one hand to melt a small puddle of metal. Your other hand manually feeds a separate filler wire into the puddle to create the joint. TIG makes stronger and more aesthetically pleasing welds and works on a larger variety of metals, but takes way longer to get the hang of and to execute. A lot of the popular welding Tiktoks feature someone making impossibly neat TIG welds that look like stacks of dimes. There’s a certain amount of street cred that comes with mastering TIG welding. But MIG welding works pretty well for how fast you can make them, and they can be beautiful too with the practiced technique.

We’ll plug in and turn on the welding machine. Then we’ll adjust the rate of flow for the inert gas, specifically an argon-CO₂ mixture, by twisting knobs on the gas cylinder. As you weld, the gas shields the molten metal from reacting with the oxygen in the air, which would create impurities and in turn weaken the weld. Hence the inert gas.

Let’s attach the ground clamp to the table. The machine pushes a very high current through the torch to create the arc that melts the piece of metal you’re trying to weld. To complete the circuit, the current must travel through the table, then the ground clamp, and finally back to the machine. It’s pretty unlikely that you’ll shock yourself, as the thick welding jacket and gloves that you’ll soon put on creates a layer of insulation. Furthermore, the welding circuit involves pretty low voltages. Ohm’s law states that voltage = current x resistance and dry skin has pretty high resistance, so the resulting current that travels through your body (i.e. what shocks you) would be very low.

After we’re suited up in the jacket, gloves, and helmet, we can make our first welds! We’ll go over two kinds of welds: 1) tack welds and 2) butt welds. Typically, if you’re welding two big pieces of metal together, you’d first tack them in place so that they’re positioned correctly, and then add the thicker butt welds for strength. To make a tack, you hold the torch such that the filler wire is about 1mm away from the piece of metal at a perpendicular angle, press the trigger for about a second to initiate the arc, and release. Keep the torch there for an extra second to allow for postflow, which is the inert gas that keeps flowing onto the weld as it solidifies.

what the arc would look like if you theoretically welded without a helmet, minus the pain! featuring a metal box that someone made at a training :>

People tend to get the hang of tacks very quickly, so we can move on to butt welds. These involve the extra step of welding over a distance. To ensure that the joint has sufficient coverage, we don’t quite weld over a straight line, but rather as loops or as zigzags. I’m more of a loops girlie, but some people find zigzags easier.



There’s a bit of learning curve to making your loops/zigzags at the right speed. Too slow would make the weld too melty and potentially blow a hole through what you’re welding. Too fast would make the weld look like a series of individual tacks that won’t hold anything together. In terms of welding lingo, melty welds are dubbed “too hot” and weak welds “too cold.” You can fix this in your technique, but sometimes the answer lies in adjusting the voltage (higher –> hotter welds) or the speed at which the filler wire is extruded (faster–> larger welds).

The other point of difficulty is that people tend to lift their torches up as they make the butt weld. Welding with the torch too far away would cause the gas to bubble up in the weld, forming what’s called an inclusion. Inclusions significantly weaken the weld and are also unaesthetically pleasing. Clearly, aesthetics are paramount. You can’t really see how far your torch is from the metal surface because the darkened helmet visor takes away all depth perception, but you can hear it. Normally, the machine creates a high frequency popping sound when you’re making a good weld. Each pop is kind of blurred into one another, like duhduhduhduh. But if you start drifting, the popping lowers in frequency, more like duh duh duh duh. That’s a cue for you to reposition.

Once everyone’s comfy with butt welds, it’s usually about an hour into the training. The second hour is reserved for welding your own thing, as long as it can be done in an hour. Depending on what people are making, I demonstrate the other tools in the hotworks room. There’s a cold saw that cuts through metal like butter, with the help of coolant automatically pumped onto the saw blade. Fresh coolant is the color of blue raspberry, but it gets recycled through the pump system and eventually takes on an sad shade of beige. There’s also a beast of a machine called the Ironworker. It uses hydraulics to press a blade to shear through metal sheets. The cold saw was down for about a week, so we had to make do 
        entirely with the Ironworker
      
 for a few trainings. Apparently if you cut a metal tube using the Ironworker, and the cut ends get flattened into a pillow shape.

robot and catamaran made by Noah and Jai during a training! the pillow shaped tubes worked really well for their pieces :>

If there’s time, we’ll go through the various sanding tools to make the welded knickknacks shiny. We’re all just crows who love shiny things. I’ve been told that if you really cared about the aesthetics of your final product, welding projects end up being 90% sanding and 10% welding.

To wrap things up, we’ll put everything back and reset the welding machines — turn off the power, close the gas canister, wrap all the cords neatly in place, and turn off the exhaust. One final sweep of the room and you’re all set! Welding tends to make your hands very gross, so I shill orange pumice cleaner as an exfoliant to get the gunk off.

I definitely spent more time teaching people how to weld than welding/crafting myself last semester. I’m glad that I did, since I’ve developed a much deeper understanding of how the process works and how to troubleshoot suspicious welds. The machines are almost like friends whose quirks you really get to know as you spend more time around them. It’s also a ton of fun watching people get the hang of it and make something they’re proud of. I hope I can block more time during IAP/next spring to take advantage of all the cool resources Metropolis has to offer and to finally finish my fire fans, but I’m thankful for the opportunity to give back to the community that’s done so much for me!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7505-400x533.jpg

go alone,Kanokwan T. '26,2,2024-01-06T00:00:00-05:00,"‎


The water is painted with soft teal waves and tinged with an amber glow. I’m sitting on a cold concrete slab, where the tides would normally spill over. I look out into the distance and squint at where the sky meets the ocean, partitioned by the faintest, haziest stroke. In front of me, the glistening sun rays dance on the water and, behind me, a night market scene is just beginning to liven up. Crowds of people are shuffling about, bustling between street acts and corner shops—but I am alone.

There is an innate human fear in being by yourself. Survival instincts tell us that we’re in greater risk of danger. The unfamiliar is scarier without friends. It can simply feel awkward fumbling to navigate places alone. Signs seem to point against doing things independently. Besides, there’s an added dimension of fun when someone else is also along for the ride, whether it be to try a new cafe or jam at a concert. Those moments are important. You can make memories and build connections. But, in that same vein, I think the benefits can also be reaped from solo experiences. You can create beautiful memories and nurture the connection you have with just yourself.

2

Going solo is empowering. I’ve learned to better trust my decisions, be adaptable to new situations, and fully reap in the moment. It’s also nice being able to think “I would like to do this thing” and just do it, instead of having conditionals and depending on others. I think it’s important to not let the absence of others prevent oneself from doing something—like, you wanting to do it is all the grounds you need. You are enough. I’ve also learned that 
        people don’t look at you as much as you may think they do.
      
In a strangely comforting way, people don’t really care. Dining alone? Dancing alone? Whatever, people at most may take a quick glance, but soon after get caught back up in their own worlds.

3

More than all of this, solo adventures are a way to literally “befriend” yourself. I love taking myself out on little outings. I often think things like…

- How would I want to spend time with my best friend right now?

- Where would I want them to take me?

- What would be nice to hear them say?

I’m happy that I’ve come to enjoy the company of myself. I like hearing 
        her
      
 observations of things. I think she has a whimsical sense of humor. She’s so willing to try new things. The lens in which she views the world from is pragmatic yet optimistic.

4

A whole different realm of possibilities open up when alone, things that you wouldn’t be able to do with others around. The life of the mind is so alive.

- You learn to exercise the muscle of making decisions, because now each one is fully your own. You can better take responsibility for your mistakes and celebrate your successes, no matter how big or small.

- It’s a great way to learn more about yourself, especially with developing taste. I think “taste” is all about exposing yourself to things and learning what things you do and do not like.

- You can lean into your senses without interruption. Sometimes, I’ve wanted to look at museum art pieces for longer, sniff the savory wafts of some restaurant entrees a bit stronger, or wander down a road at a rate much slower.

- People watching is so pleasant. Of course, you can do this in the company of others but, when alone, it’s just you and the world.

My friend Malachi M. ’25 once asked me “how do you just… go out and do things? how do you trust yourself?” which got me working through some thoughts that eventually led to this blog. By going solo, you can more deeply understand what you like to do, what items in stores you gravitate towards, and what you are capable of doing. These solo experiences exist on a wide spectrum, from reading in a local cafe to taking a train over to another country. They can happen anywhere. Here are some of my stories:

‎

For years, I wanted to travel somewhere alone, but there was always a layer of fear that accompanied this desire. Regardless, I felt there was a constant allure that came with a trip where it’d just be me on my own two feet. I could do whatever I wanted. Admittedly, maybe the teen angst was getting to me, too. So, eventually, I embarked on my first solo trip, then my second trip, and am now making it an annual thing.

2022: Key West, Florida (USA)

June 7th — June 11th

I knew I wanted one thing, and that was to be by the water. As a Nevadan, I had my fair share of California visits, so I decided to stick to the east coast. After googling things like “safest places for women to travel alone in the US” and “affordable oceanside US cities,” I landed on Key West Island in Florida. Sandwiched between spring finals and the start of my summer research, this trip served as a fun, liminal time between my commitments.

2023: Cardiff, Wales (UK)

July 28th — August 1st

While working in England this past summer, I had a goal of visiting all four countries that comprised the United Kingdom. I considered prioritizing other European countries, but I wanted to better understand British culture and plan something more budget-friendly. Wales was the last country I had left, so I made that location my solo trip of the summer. I considered going to a national park, exploring some caves, and visiting Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch 
        (the longest city name in Europe),
      
 but all of those things were in the north. I lived close to the south. If I elected to go north, I’d spend far more money and a third of my trip would just be commuting, so I decided to explore the local charm of the capital instead. By this point, I wanted more of a rejuvenating vacation rather than a full-blown, activities-packed agenda anyways, so this trip felt more fitting.

2024: ???

I have no clue where I’m going yet, but I’m excited for whatever this trip becomes…

in this coming year we run,Amber V. '24,0,2024-01-05T00:00:00-05:00,"In review — it’s been a good year. In reverse-chronological order, I…

- full sent a project, which was cool No one in my life has heard about this at all, but this fall I was in 2.009 [link]. We sent that project, lived in lab night and day. I’ve fallen deeply into projects before, but never one with this many team members involved, nor with this many moving parts. I loved the camaraderie of people all grinding to finish their part of the project — there were vital sections of the project that I never touched, and only knew about because someone else was sweating over it. Seeing everything come together was so rewarding. I love the feeling of having a complex system in my head, understanding one part of the puzzle so deeply. I’ve been wanting to have this group project experience at MIT for a while, and am glad it happened the way it did.

- I spoke in public a LOT of times: for MIT Monologues, where I wrote and memorized an 8-minute monologue; for a club where I teach oral storytelling; and for 2.009, where I presented a solid five times, usually with about one hour’s worth of 
        preparation.
      
 I used to have a fair bit of social anxiety. I still struggle to be appropriately formal sometimes, but I like to think my lack of formal diction is relatable and shows that I’m comfortable with the material I’m presenting. Likewise I haven’t become not awkward, but I’ve learned how to use my awkwardness in a cool fun relatable way, which is a more powerful tool for me.

b1!111!!!!!11!11!

- I love b1, my dorm community. Bonergiving was the cutest event, and I felt so warm and loved. When I moved onto floor, I hoped I would learn from everyone around me in new and different ways — that I’d be inspired by their fashion and their social energy, their wide variety of interests both social and academic. And it’s worked. I recently got a jellyfish haircut that Kyna suggested, copied low-cut jeans and folded-over jeans from people on floor. I encourage the free food culture on floor to thrive — we always arrive first to Burton Connor free food events.



- I love my friends. They are so good. This was true last year but it continues to be good this year so I am gonna put it down. I also feel happy with my friends-work balance. What hours of sleep weren’t lost to 2.009 were lost to hanging out in one friend’s room, or on another’s rug, or in the flounge with lots of people dropping in and out of conversation. Those delirious hours are precious, more so because they are hewn from the mound of work we all shoulder. They’re the best part of this semester by far, and I appreciate all the people who pause from their work and spend time together with me.

- I feel like an engineer. Impostor syndrome rears its head sometimes, but this semester proved to me that I can get it done. 2.009 pushed me hard. I had to build a model in seven hours in October, with barely any notice, and I got it done. Its mechanism worked. Before Contour, I’d barely touched software and electronics at a deep level. Then I led the design and validation of the electronics, and those worked, too. I feel much more confident in starting a project I don’t know how to do; I can figure out how, via YouTube and bothering experts around me, and the greatest learning will happen when I cobble those resources together and make the thing work.

- I am maybe in less pain now? After taking a month-long vacation of doing almost entirely nothing? I spent the summer in large intense amounts of pain though so maybe it evens out. 

- I travelled a lot (mostly on MIT’s budget). I took an IAP class that brought me to Brazil, where I studied Brazilian culture and history, made an informal study of trying every type of food I could find on the street, and went up a lot of mountains. The class left me with a lot of thoughts about culture and community, and reminded me to make space for connecting with my cultures more deeply, even — especially — during the rush of MIT.

I went on a self-funded trip to Ciudad de Mexico, where a friend of mine has family. We visited her family and explored the city, trying every type of food and lots and lots of tacos. I had a lot of thoughts about the closeness and the distance I felt from Mexico, the nation, as opposed to the Mexican-American / Chicano culture in southern Arizona where I grew up. My Spanish could be better. I want to go back for longer, perhaps for a season or a year, long enough that my Spanish improves, that I can start to melt into the culture. Then I applied for a grant through MIT to travel around Ireland and learn about folklore traditions there. I hiked part of the Kerry Way [link], an ancient walking path that cuts through private pastures, as is apparently tradition. I also saw the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, a great gathering of artists, dancers, comedians, circus performers, and more from all over the world. The streets were full of tourists. It felt like REX, but for art: too many events to possibly see at once, some cool and some weird and most a mix of both. The best way to experience it was to go with the flow.

tiny concert

All told, that was lovely. Which brings me to my intentions for the coming year:

- get more rest. I pushed back a lot of responsibilities to make sure that 2.009 happened, and the minute it ended, instead of getting to collapse, I had to write two final papers, an application essay, and more. I haven’t been getting the 10 hours of sleep that some teammates got, and I can feel myself running out of steam. I tend to spend my days at MIT working through a haze of sleep deprivation and pain — and in some ways this is unavoidable, see also ‘pain.’ But the sleep deprivation part can be improved. I want to rest.

-  full send more things! I want to find a project (either job or program) that I am as passionate about, that I can fall deeply into. I’d like a team as fun to work with, too.

The name is not false advertising. I got a tattoo here.

- Push myself athletically. Try to physically Die more often. I think I only (figuratively) physically Died twice last semester: once after trail-running a 16-mile hike in Rio, Brazil, and once after walking across all of Rhode Island [link] (30 miles, but 33 since I went the wrong way. Walking from the end of the trail to the train station was the worst part by far). I also went on some hikes that were kind of hard, like the Kerry Way one (50 miles in 3 days),  and a 14-mile one in New Hampshire that knocked out 3 of the 48 4,000-ft peaks. 
The funny thing about hiking with a group as an endurance athlete is that the people around you tend to be suffering more, even thought they enjoy suffering less than you do, so really everyone is unsatisfied with the distribution of 
        suffering.
      
I want to push myself harder athletically, especially on long hikes and runs. I enjoy the feeling of thinking I can’t do something, then pushing through it. And the best beer / yogurt / weird microwaved ‘Mexican’ pizza I’ve ever tasted were eaten right after intense hikes.

One of our less intense Rio hikes was to see Jesus

- engage with activism more. I am not sure how much I am allowed to write about this, but activism has always been a core part of my identity. After the most recent election and after moving to Massachusetts — a very different environment than Arizona — I let my commitment to activism lie fallow. I’ve been re-engaging more over the past year, and intend to devote more time to this in the coming semester. 

- think about Pain. Could I get away with taking a month off every year? Would this perhaps make me sad. Or unemployed. How will I do everything that I want to.

- keep up the high energy / relentless pace. Is this antithetical to the ‘rest’ point above? Yeah totally but don’t think about that too hard. I love everything that’s going on — the classes I’m signed up for, in precision engineering and Yiddish short stories and fantasy writing; the UROP I’m going to finally have time for; the weeknight hangouts and weekend adventures with friends. I love keeping afloat in the rush of it all, living as much life as I can this last semester.

what I did this semester,Gloria Z. '26,7,2024-01-05T00:00:00-05:00,"Compared to the previous, this semester was less tumultuous, more of a steady rush of things-to-do rather than a series of breathless waves. It helped that I got an early start, having stayed in Boston during the summer as well and moving into my dorm as soon as I was able. Overall, I have few complaints about how everything went, save the laments that come up at the end of every semester: learning more from my classes, exercising more, being more on top of things, etc. But I think I did the best I could, all things considered. So, then–what actually happened?

 

1) I went to class (more)

I took 5 classes this semester, three technicals and two studios. They are as follows:

- 8.02 – Physics II

- 2.004 – Dynamics and Control II

- 6.1210 – Introduction to Algorithms

- 4.341 – Introduction to Photography and Related Media

- 4.301 – Introduction to Artistic Experimentation

I also shopped 21M.601 – Drawing for Designers for a couple weeks, but I was very much not built for 7-10PM classes.

 

8.02 – Physics II

8.02 is a 
        GIR
      
, and it is (from the course description) an introduction to electromagnetism and electrostatics. I don’t have much to say about this class… I did indeed learn some physics.

2.004 – Dynamics and Control II

Despite its name, 2.004 mainly focuses on the control part; its precursor, 2.003 Dynamics and Control I, centers instead on dynamics. This was my favorite class this semester, for a variety of reasons: I really enjoyed the professor’s lecturing style, we had hands-on lab sections where we got to see the theory in action, and I had a great pset group (we had taken 2.003 together as well).

At a high level, 2.004 introduces the analysis and control of open and closed-loop feedback systems. A guiding problem is that of regulating the temperature of a room. If we want to be at 67°F but our room is currently at 70°, cold air has to be pumped in. But how much, and for how long? Too much—we overshoot and get too cold; too little—we take forever to reach 67°. Do we want to prioritize system speed, stability, energy consumption, or some other factor? 2.004 introduces techniques to answer these questions.

6.006 – Introduction to Algorithms

6.006 was my earliest class, so my attendance for it unfortunately dwindled to near zero by week three. Despite this, I actually really enjoyed the content of the class, mostly gleaned from reading lecture notes. There was much less coding than I expected, and most of our problem sets consisted of writing out descriptions of algorithms and proving that they worked.

4.341 – Introduction to Photography and Related Media

I wrote a bit about 4.341 and 4.301 in my previous blog art things #1, but in summary, 4.341 was bisected into two units on digital and film photography. For the first half, we completed various shooting exercises (e.g. using long exposure). For the second half, we learned the whole process of shooting film and developing it ourselves in the darkroom. The night before our final film deadline, several classmates and I spent an unfortunate all-nighter in the red-lit enlarging room, swirling pieces of printing paper around in tubs of chemicals until our fingertips were dry and gummy to the touch.

Due to the nature of photography, completing assignments for 4.341 often meant going somewhere and doing something that wasn’t staring at my laptop screen. I found myself walking down Newbury Street asking strangers if I could take their picture, waking up at 7AM to shoot pigeons at Revere Beach, and hunting for cool lighting in the Media Lab in the middle of the night. The class made for a welcome break from my technicals, and I really liked all the other students in my section!

4.301 – Introduction to Artistic Experimentation

In 4.301, we worked through a series of different mediums—printmaking, ceramics, sound art, and weaving—with overarching themes of addressing climate, land, and water issues. There was more of a fine arts emphasis, which I really liked, as my previous 
        4B
      
 classes were much more design-oriented. We also went on a couple field trips to learn about climate initiatives and textiles!

I kind of wish I had put more effort into my projects in this class; I didn’t develop many of them fully for lack of time, and as a result I can’t say I’m very proud of everything I made (some of it still unfinished). Despite that, though, it was a lovely class, with a wonderful professor and TA.

2) I made stuff

I made a lot more art this semester and I’m very happy about that! I mostly made 2D work, but I also started learning 3D techniques (ceramics!), which I’m excited to continue with. 

In 2023, I slowly registered just how important art is to me, and how it’s soaked into every aspect of my life. I think I have always considered myself an artist first and everything else second, but this semester I became much more cognizant of this fact and its implications. I felt an increasing dissonance between my love for art and a self-imposed pressure to create things–but not just things, good things that are worth people’s attention and have something substantial to say. I like the things I make, but I’m also constantly frustrated with my lack of output and improvement, especially compared to the amazing artists I follow online (which is obviously unfair; they are either students at art schools or professionals whose jobs are to make art). I’m trying to remedy this relationship; I want to keep a certain level of pressure to push myself to get better, but I also want to give more grace to my work, my ideas, and my ego. MIT can be a difficult environment to be creative in, to say the least. I want to make well researched, large-scale work, but I also want to retain the childlike feeling of smearing pastel across newsprint, which is, I think, the soul of art in the first place: the rub of charcoal on skin, the choke of woven fibers, the pungence of turpentine. So all that to say I want to simultaneously make more and care less, however that manifests.

More tangibly, my goals for next semester include getting better at ceramics, doing more figure drawing/painting, designing and printing a zine, and making an installation! :)

 

3) I lifted

My biggest goal this semester was to go to the gym consistently, and I think I more or less hit it. Unfortunately, I didn’t actually improve that much in terms of how much I could lift; my workouts weren’t always very focused or at the optimal time of day for energy, and I definitely did not get enough protein most days. Despite that, though, the mental and physical benefits of having a daily gym routine more than made up for it, and I always left the Z in a better mood than when I entered. I upgraded my gym gear too, which felt very serious and professional: I got lifting straps (straps that wrap around your wrist and a dumbbell) since my grip strength was starting to become a limiting factor, started taking preworkout, and tried various brands of protein shakes. And I got my first pull-up!! 😎

I also tried to get into running this semester, with the initial target of training for a 5K with my friend. The training we did do, but we didn’t end up running the actual race day-of, due to sickness and cold weather. Trust, though… it WILL happen next semester 🤞. I’m pretty ambivalent about running as compared to lifting; I like the post-run endorphins, but I can’t run for long enough to reach a runner’s high, and I think I’m too much of an iPad baby anyway. I realized part of the reason I like lifting is because I can look at my phone between sets, and I can make each workout a little unique by incorporating new exercises, doing movements with a different tempo, or focusing on separate muscle groups. Maybe this says something about my brain and dopamine/novelty addiction or something like that… but for now I will not think about it too much and just keep trying to get swole.

how I’m trying to be in 2024

 

4) I also… (rapid fire round, in the spirit of kano and jessica‘s recent blogs)

- became a blogger!

- was a counselor for FAP (first-year arts program) alongside jebby, fatima, and head counselor teresa



- went to four concerts: The Strokes (my top artist!), Boygenius (on my birthday!), The 1975, and Slaughter Beach, Dog

- joined then deaffiliated from a sorority (the people were lovely, I just didn’t have time :P)

- took too many naps on the building N52 couch

- sold things at the MIT craft fair

our wares! animal crossing stickers/prints/store signs by teresa. ceramics/fish stickers/other prints by me

- became a mentor for Metropolis

- bounced around Boston with my high school friends during thanksgiving break

so fall, so new england

- watched the entire Scott Pilgrim anime in one day (release day 🙏)

- dyed my hair bright orange

it’s really bright under white light

- went to my first housewarming party

- attended a friendsgiving potluck with so so many delicious dishes this was only half of the table



this was only half of the table

- and saw many beautiful sunsets!

#nofilter

So that’s it, then, or as much as I remember. There’s so much more that happened, little breaths of sweet autumn air or a conversation that lasted far beyond its last sentence, but those moments are less tangible, better lived than written about, at least for now.

My 2023 Libby Wrapped,Allison E. '27,3,2024-01-03T00:00:00-05:00,"Spotify Wrapped came out a little while ago, and Kayode wrote a post about all our results that you should definitely check out!

My own Spotify Wrapped is unfortunately a little underwhelming, since I use Spotify for <1/3 of my music listening. It’s mostly to discover new songs/artists, so I only actually recognized one out of my top five artists this year (and that person was 4th) 💀

Music is also not my preferred medium of auditory engagement—I spend most of my time as a shamelessly mindless consumer of audiobooks. And when I say mindless consumer, I mean mindless consumer. No thoughts, just a constant stream of words going in one ear and out the other while walking to class, while eating, while doing chores, and oftentimes even while doing 
        homework
      
 🫣. It’s a bit of a problem.

And before you ask, no! This blog is not sponsored by Audible. In fact, this post is anti-sponsored by Audible. I may have written an entire blog reviewing Amazon products, but I only bow down to the Bezos occasionally, and this is not one of those occasions.

You know who I do bow down to? MY LOCAL LIBRARY!!

Yessiree, folks, this post is sponsored by YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY! If you like audiobooks, consider getting a FREE library card at the branch nearest to you! You could gain access to tens of thousands of online audiobooks, including most popular new releases FREE OF CHARGE!

In all seriousness, the public library system is a truly amazing institution, and they’ve put an amazing effort into ~keeping up with the times~ by building digital collections! You can borrow almost any audiobook you want for 2-3 weeks at a time, and the library has so many copies of the more popular books that there’s usually no wait—or at most it’s a couple weeks. Seriously, it’s the best thing ever. Get a 
        library card
      
. Get the Libby app. Profit from never spending money to consume books ever again!

As a side benefit of obsessively using Libby, I can go into my loan history and see every audiobook I’ve ever listened to, when I borrowed it, and how long I spent listening to it.

And so… after forty-five minutes of manually entering this information into a spreadsheet instead of doing my PSets, I hereby present…

Allison’s 2023 Audiobook Wrapped!

My full spreadsheet is linked here, but to expand on/summarize it:

I spent 41,207 minutes listening to audiobooks in 2023. That’s 686 hours, or 28.6 days!

I started listening to 66 audiobooks, and finished 44 of them. That means I finished 67% of the audiobooks I started, which is pretty low, but at least it’s an improvement on past years (I think). I know my interests better, and more importantly, I know what audiobooks will be easy for me to understand while multitasking and good for my general state of happiness.

My numbers are chronologically messy because the data is all concentrated on the date when I borrowed the book, but I likely listened the most during the month of July—starting 7 books and listening for 107 hours. 

The longest I’ve spent listening to one audiobook is “The Source,” by James Michener. I didn’t finish it. It’s 55 hours long. I tried really hard because it was actually really interesting, but I think I just don’t have the stamina for 55 hours of one book LOL. 34 hours isn’t terrible though!

Honorable mention goes to “Iron Flame,” which was 28+ hours of pure brain rotting fun that I thoroughly enjoyed. I finished it in four days, which is mildly concerning. Right behind that was “The Fountainhead” by Ayn Rand, which I tried to read because of an essay contest. It was more interesting than I thought, and even though a lot of it flew over my head, I think I understand why it’s so controversial. I got through 27/32 hours before giving up. So close, but I just couldn’t.

My top author is Orson Scott Card, which isn’t at all a surprise to me. I spent 191 hours , which is 11,000+ minutes and >25% of my listening time on his books. 16 in total. Finished them all. It’s majorly problematic, for one because I should not be listening to these books for the 7th time. I should also not be listening to the same book twice in three months. Most importantly, I discovered recently that Card is someone that I really, deeply disagree with. They’re not even the greatest books (as I am learning after seven listens). But these stories have been my comfort blanket since middle school. I listened to them a lot during the hectic, unfamiliar first few weeks at MIT, and I listened to more as I’ve settled back at home over winter break. It’s one indulgence that I just can’t bring myself to give up, especially when familiar stories help me get through change.

If I had to pick a non-comfort-based, non-statistical favorite book from this year, though… it’d probably be “The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August,” by Claire North. I’m a massive sucker for anything time travel-adjacent, and this story had a really unique take on the quintessential “time traveler” society. I don’t know if there was anything particularly deep, but this was just a really fun read for my tastes, and that’s my only requirement!

Ok, analysis done! If you’re looking for actual book recs, I apologize, but I have literally no more thoughts in my head. I don’t remember 70% of the books on this list. I couldn’t tell you who their main characters were, and I couldn’t tell you anything about the plot. I think I really just listen to audiobooks the way many people listen to music—as much as I wish I could be a cool person with Literary Thoughts™ and actual taste, I have pathetically few intellectual thoughts about books. I just listen to things because they sound nice and because they make me feel the way I want to feel—like the 
        movie soundtrack
      
 of my life, I suppose! They’re awesome, and fun, and ever-present in my life, but they’re also not the focal point of the story.

So there we go—my audiobook wrapped! And if you’re looking for a good distraction in this hectic season, don’t forget to check out today’s sponsor, YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY, and use my promo code “Hi, I’d like to get a library card!” to start listening for NO MONEY DOWN, NO MONEY FOREVER!",,0
"Goodbye 2023, Hello 2024",Jessica Z. '27,3,2024-01-01T00:00:00-05:00,"In the rush of finals and the end of the semester, I’ve been losing track of time. I flew back home to Pennsylvania for the first time on December 22 after my last final, drove home from the airport, and fell asleep in my bed for a solid thirteen hours. I’ve spent my time back home with my parents and brother, visiting my grandparents, seeing old high school and childhood friends, and blissfully wandering around town without a single thought of psets on my mind.

I didn’t anticipate the end of 2023 to sneak up so quickly, and I opened my planner last Wednesday to the shocking realization that there was less than a week until New Year’s Day.

New Years is in my
         top two favorite holidays.
      
I like the idea of a clean slate, starting again, and having a fresh beginning. Despite this, I’ve never truly made New Years resolutions with a strong commitment to them—I’ve always just had a vague idea of things that would be nice to do or learn without any concrete plans on how to achieve those goals. In the spirit of entering the
        last half of my freshman year,
      
I want to reflect on 2023, but first, I want to set some goals for 2024.

Start my
        UROP.
      


Why: I’m currently
        juggling between different majors
      
without a definite idea of what I want to study. I knew I wanted a biology-related UROP, but I was unsure if I should stick to my previous research field or explore a new, but related, field. I ended up choosing a lab in the mechanical engineering department with a focus on biomedical devices, and I start next month during
        IAP!
      


During my second meeting with the lab, I learned part of my work would include coding and data set development. While I wasn’t initially anticipating this, I think it’s a good way for me to try a new field. Full discloser: I am very nervous, but I want to
        do research as a career,
      
and my lab mentors reassured me that I could learn when I told them I didn’t have experience in those areas.

How: I’m not necessarily sure how to quantify this resolution since the project is relatively new and not super defined right now. So, instead of measuring this goal by the project’s success, I’m setting two general goals from this UROP: 1.) figure out if I like mechanical engineering and/or computer science mixed with biology and 2.) learn how to organize an effective research plan. To reflect on these as my UROP continues, I’m keeping a small progress log about each day in my UROP. I’ve done this before for other research projects, and I liked being able to understand how my research progressed on a daily basis.

Learn Python and Fusion360. 

Why: In a pinned note on my phone, there’s a running list of things I want to learn before leaving MIT. There’s a lot and definitely more than I can realistically do in one year: learn color theory, become financially literate, learn Spanish, learn the piano, etc. I reviewed my list yesterday just to realize how many of them were different software or programming applications. It’s been a goal of mine to learn how to code for a long time, but I always picked it up briefly only to drop it later on.

My goal is to learn the basics of Python and Fusion360. Right now, the software applications I can use are
        PyMOL, VMD, and NAMD,
      
which are helpful for protein modeling, but not super applicable to other research fields and don’t involve a lot of coding in my experience. I picked Python because it’s complimentary with my UROP, and I chose Fusion360 because I want to improve my CAD skills for engineering.

How: I made a Notion calendar to track how much I work in both Python and Fusion360 over 2024. Realistically, I don’t think I’ll be able to practice daily, but I do want to put in enough time that I can see some progress every ~2 weeks. Python is easier to commit to since I’ll be practicing it by default through my UROP, but I’m also trying to
        OCW
      
and YouTube video my way into learning more. As for Fusion360, my friends suggested a few beginner-friendly projects to get me started.

Fix my sleep schedule. 

Why: In short, I had a terrible sleep schedule in the fall. To be clear, it was my problem: my sleep schedule started off well during the first few weeks of being on campus, but I started unnecessarily staying up to cram in assignments that weren’t even due or staying up abysmally late with friends. My schedule devolved into an unfortunate amount of 3am bedtimes.

How: I realized half-way through the semester that I am wayyy more productive when I’m not working in my dorm or room. Right now, I’ve been most effective at finishing work early if I drag myself to study in the Stud or Stata. I also started studying with a group of friends, which has helped hold me accountable for doing my work. Towards the end of finals week, I started falling back into my old habit of dorm studying when most study spots were crowded, but this Spring, I’m going to try and find more places on campus to study.

Explore MIT and Boston more. 

Theres so much to do at MIT and in Boston. While I feel like I’ve taken advantage of it, I want to do a lot more: ice skating, pottery, dance workshops, painting classes, etc. I had plans that ended up getting pushed off for last minute finals studying, so I’m hoping to use IAP and second semester to explore the other special parts of the MIT community and Boston area.

Write more. 

Why: I think I forgot how much I enjoyed writing because, frankly, the last time I wrote for a significant period of time was for college applications. For my
        STS.011
      
class, our final project was a paper on an STS topic of our choice. I chose to write about science communication, particularly how science can be misrepresented and lead to unintentional confusion for non-technical audiences. While the assignment took a long time, it helped me remember how much I liked writing—in 2024, I’m simply hoping to write more.

How: I’m taking a
        CI-H
      
class next semester, so I’m more-so hoping to do reflective writing in my free time. I’d like to start blogging more and journaling on a consistent base, even if it’s just for 5-10 minutes at the end of each day.

2023, despite all of its difficulties, was one of my favorite years. January to May was fun because it was second semester of my senior year filled with Prom and Graduation. It was, by far, my favorite year in high school. I spent my summer with childhood and high school friends, enjoying our last time together before we were all scattered off into different states and colleges. I traveled to West Virginia for a summer camp and met some of my closest friends that I still keep in frequent contact with today. And, of course, I started my first year of college :)

Some other things I did in 2023:

- Went on a senior trip to New York with friends

- Graduated high school

- Hiked twelve miles

- Sat in a hammock for the first time

- Saw Hadestown on Broadway

- Visited DC, Rhode Island, New York, Maryland, Maine, West Virginia, and New Hampshire

- Went to my first concert (Joji!)

- Ate lots of hotpot

- Passed 8.01 after thinking I was going to
        NR it
      


- Watched a lot of sunsets by the Charles River

- Drank copious amounts of boba

- Planned and hosted Friendsgiving

- Baked 200+ cookies for the holiday

- Tried iHOP for the first time

- Visited Snowport

- Went to the 2.009 final presentation

- and more :)

There’s already a lot I’m excited for in 2024: taking more film photos, turning 19, visiting old friends, starting research, finishing my first year of college. I like New Years because it’s simple—it doesn’t promise anything, but it gives space to hope for something if you want to, and I’m excited to see where the new year takes me.

Happy New Year!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-01-at-1.53.04-AM-800x541.png

I Miss College Application Season,Kayode D. '27,5,2023-12-31T00:00:00-05:00,"[The following is a collection of ramblings and memory unloadings that I wrote throughout the semester, typically whenever I missed home. I titled each document “I miss application season,” but over the course of writing and editing this, I realized that I don’t really miss applying, I miss being in high school.]


        I miss college application season.
      


I miss the research. I miss going to college websites and reading through all of their pages and thinking about going to school there. I miss the potential–oh the potential. So much of it. So many dreams, so many possibilities, and they were all mine. I could go anywhere I wanted to, I thought, and all that was stopping me was a 750 word essay on my greatest challenges that I couldn’t get myself to write. 

I miss signing up for college campus tours. I miss feeling out of place on those tours. I miss seeing MIT for the first time. I miss the amazing tour guide that I had. I miss feeling like of all the people that go on these tours, I could maybe be one of the few that actually gets to go to school here. I remember that on one tour I went on, I was the only senior in the entire group. Everyone else was an underclassmen. I felt so behind.

I miss writing the application essays. I miss exploring myself, and seeing how I really grew during the experiences I wrote about. I miss the sheer euphoria I felt when I finished an essay that I thought I did well. But I would never wish to do it again.

I miss listening to Indie pop. I miss discovering all of the music that is nostalgic for me now. I miss the witty lyrics and heartfelt chords that I listened to while I applied to college. I miss being Wasted on the Senate Floor, and listening to Breathless on DVD and Zelda and Don’t Shoot Me Santa…and yet i fish. I miss Mal Blum, and watching virtual college tours. I miss having all the hope in the world and no responsibilities tied to that yet.  I miss listening to the Christmasy Drums of “Classic j dies and goes to heck” while I drive through the foggy December streets after work, the traffic lights looking faintly like glowing eyes, tired but relenting to let me pass.

I miss working at Hometown Pizza. I miss Mr. Hometown, and my coworkers. I miss taking home a large pizza (against store policy) every night, and eating more pizza in those few months than in the entire previous year.

I miss driving around my town, listening to my ABBA Gold CD and driving 5 over the speed limit. I miss driving around McDonalds almost every day, just so I could see a girl I thought was cute. I miss when that was the biggest thing on my mind.

I miss reading Brave New World in English 100. I miss the way my teacher would turn something that could be monotonous into one of the most profound and deep classes I’ve ever taken. He did not have to put so much work into making the class so interactive and free, but he did, and I am thankful to him for this. I will never forget the readings we did, or the lessons we learned about literature, society, and life that we learned in that class. 

I miss making wishes at 11:11 in English class. I miss the way my friend used to make the most ridiculous and hilarious wishes, while I just wished to get into an ivy league school. 

I miss looking through the old yearbooks from the 80’s in the school library. I miss wearing crewneck sweatshirts in the parking lot covered in dead leaves. I still have them but it’s not the same. I miss how cool I felt wearing a crewneck, like I wanted to be warm but not hoodie warm. I miss sitting in the school parking lot doomscrolling and stressing. And I freaking miss parking lots so much. I miss hanging out with my friends in the school parking lot because we had nothing to do. I miss how a lot of different friend groups meshed at the end of the year and we’d spend every friday hanging out in the high school parking lot. We all wished we had more time to hangout, now that we all finally put our differences aside and tried hanging out together. We would give (very bad) haircuts and play frisbee, and people would show up after work with pizza or cookies or whatever small town fast food place they worked at. It was amazing and I miss it so much. 

I miss playing Jazz for the sake of playing Jazz. I miss Blues in Hoss Flat, and Father Song, and Solid as a Rock, and TGIF. I miss Picking Up the Pieces, but DON”T STEAL MY STUFF!! I miss playing Charlie Brown every morning, and the way that the bass guitar I played fit so well underneath the sound of the guitar. I miss Sam, who refused to play unless his feet were propped up on the guitar amp. I miss the way he would show up RIGHT AT the bell almost every day, or not at all. I miss how he used to use dermatologist and dentist notes to skip whole days of school, even though the appointment took 15 minutes. I miss jazz concerts. 

I miss marching band. I miss doing one last run through as the sun set over the valley and the burger king it outlined in the distance. I miss wheeling all the equipment up the parking lot, and playing tetris to put it all away. I miss staying up late to play at football games. I miss playing “White Boy Smooth” as we walked onto the field. I miss the way we could never play it clean, not even once. I miss the disapproving face of our percussion instructor as we fumble through our march and the national anthem. I miss the 48 packs of generic Soda we would buy from Walmart and smuggle into the football games. I miss mixing “Dr. Thunder” and “Mt. Lightning” to make “Doctor Mountain.” I miss those band days so much. 

I miss playing board games with my family. I miss playing Catan and watching Australian Survivor, and watching cartoons on Saturday Mornings. I miss Steven Universe, and 
        Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
      
, and playing fortnite–I miss fortnite so much. I’m sorry, I know it’s lame, but I miss playing fortnite with my friends.

October 4th,

I miss october. 

I miss my birthday. I miss the presents that I would get that fit neatly into one bag. The cards from friends and relatives, the among us piggy bank and throw blanket, the tub of little army soldiers, the pokemon cards. I miss how my 17th birthday party looked like one for a little kid. 

I miss riding the school bus.

I miss playing music in Sam’s basement. I miss our original band name: “Love, Jane”. We later found out that’s the name of a clothing line and had to think of a new one. I remembered reading Sam’s text and immediately trying to think of the most outrageous name I could on the fly, and ended up proposing “Willy Nilly and the Black Friday Crowd,” a name that (despite Sam’s best efforts) immediately stuck and will forever hold a place in my heart. 

I miss lugging my bass guitar amp through his yard, absolutely FILLED with dead leaves. I miss the way my 2010 nissan altima sat half in the street and half in his yard. I miss Sam’s death trap of a car, with dirty windows and a dirtier interior. I miss the sounds it would make when it pulled into the school parking lot, making sounds straight out of horror movie. I miss the way his garage opened from the back. I miss playing “Stacy’s Mom” and “Should I stay or should I go?” I miss the 50 dollar drumset the guys got off facebook marketplace, with garbage drum heads that our keyboardist drew all over when I was late to practice one day. I miss playing really loud, and leaving the garage door cracked because it was so cold. We played so loud we blew out all the lights in the basement. We used a christmas tree as the primary source of light after that. Sorry Sam’s parents. 

I miss my bedroom. I never really liked it. I didn’t put up posters until I was leaving. My walls were bare for years, despite my mom’s frustration. I miss the lamp that used to be in the living room, and the comforter on my bed that wasn’t 7 feet off the ground like it is now in my dorm room. I really dislike the lofted bed I use now. I miss the pile of college mail that accumulated under my piano keyboard, because I couldn’t find a better place for it. I miss my 2 windows that let a lot of light in when I wanted and none when I didn’t, rather than the 30 windows in my dorm room now. 

I miss being good at drumming. I miss when I used to actually practice. I miss playing snare drum at football games and drum set at basketball games. I miss standing up for each other. I miss practicing in the school parking lot. I miss micro analyzing and improving my playing, and feeling like I was actually good at a thing that most people are not good at. I miss fitting instruments into the twenty year old band trailer. I miss wearing that Van Gogh hat I borrowed from a friend and to this day have yet to return. I miss yelling to “HELP THE PIT!” with the drumline after practice, even though no one ever would. I miss playing in the stands at football and basketball games. I miss the hot chocolate and bags of candy the band moms would prepare in the cold. I miss burning my tongue every single year, and feeling it for weeks and weeks. 

I miss college application interviews. I miss meeting at different starbucks around Louisville with Alumni from the schools that I wanted to go to. I was stressed beyond all belief. I ordered a small hot chocolate at each one, and I remember my MIT interviewer looked disappointed as he ordered a small coffee as well. I remember that I didn’t think the MIT interview went well. He asked questions I wasn’t prepared for, and I felt like we didn’t really connect, until he asked me what I was currently hyper fixated on or obsessed with. If you know anything about me, you know that you don’t really want me to unload that kind of information. I told him about the Dyatlov Pass Incident, where 9 college students went missing in the Northern Ural Mountains of Russia, before they were found under the snow having ripped through their tents and run into the cold without socks or shoes on. It remains a mystery to this day, and a movie was made about it that I watched 3 times in one weekend.

He was hooked. He was genuinely interested. It was amazing. 

I don’t miss applying to college, I miss being a senior. 

——————————————————————————————————————————-

I do not miss Winter Break, 2022. 

It took me so long to write my application essays. I procrastinated writing them until winter break, and so I spent the overwhelming majority of my break working on those essays and applications. Sometimes I felt like it was hopeless and questioned why I was even doing any of this, but then I’d think about how far I had come. I did everything in what feels now like a hazy blur. I know some of you reading this are still working on your applications (I know I was 365 days ago). I was in your shoes last year, I feel you. You’re at 4th and goal and you just can’t seem to get your essays the way you want them to be. Hear my dad’s advice: just focus on one thing at a time, and do it. Focus on one school, and one essay, and get it done before moving on to the next one. It doesn’t have to be pretty, it just has to be done. You’ve come so far and you’re this close. You’ve done so much work, just sit down and finish the job. Use your voice, tell your story, and submit. 

Then Enjoy Your Senior Year. I cannot stress this enough. If I haven’t made it obvious in this post thus far, I don’t miss applying to college as much as I miss the things I did while applying to college and after I was done. The things I remember most from senior year were the times I wasn’t thinking about the future and I was living in the now. I wish that I did more of that. If I could go back I would spend more time in the parking lot, and play more music with Sam, and probably get more McDonalds. 

So, as I told students on the MIT early admitted live stream, ENJOY BEING A SENIOR. Go have fun and take a break. Cherish these moments, because you can’t really go back when it’s over. 

Now I’m going to go play Fortnite. They added the Ninja Turtles to the game :)",,0
I swear this isn’t an ad for Google,Andi Q. '25,2,2023-12-31T00:00:00-05:00,"Earlier this year, I had planned to write a blog post testing whether it’s possible to train a machine-learning model to learn Course 6’s new class numbering system. It would’ve been so cool – I was going to code up an interactive diagram 
        showing off the new numbering system
      
, build a little ML model from scratch, and even dunk on large language models like GPT-4 for not knowing basic facts you can find via a quick Google search.

But then Google came along and ruined everything by releasing Gemini, their GPT-4 competitor. Unlike ChatGPT (running GPT-4), Google’s Bard (running Gemini) uses up-to-date information and seems to know how the new Course 6 numbering system works.

Correct! It’s made even more impressive by the fact that MIT never explicitly says anywhere that 6.24xx is quantum engineering, but all three 6.24xx classes are indeed about quantum engineering

It sometimes even correctly classifies hypothetical classes that don’t exist yet, which is very cool (and a bit scary)! Although there are still a few kinks in the system…

So yes, it is possible to train an ML model to learn the new Course 6 numbering system (although using a large language model like Gemini is probably not the best way to do so). I was a bit disappointed that Google had sniped me like that, but it made me wonder how much Gemini knows about MIT. If it knows about the Course 6 renumbering, what other random fun facts does it know that a typical non-MIT person wouldn’t?

“How many windows does Simmons Hall have?”



Ouch, ok.

Just kidding, that wasn’t the actual answer that Bard gave.



Simmons does indeed have 5538 windows (we counted them to verify this number last CPW)! 
        ChatGPT
      
 and the previous version of Bard were never able to tell funny jokes (or give the correct window count of Simmons), so I also appreciated the velociraptor joke at the end.

This question was very low-hanging fruit, so I expected Bard to answer it easily. Now onto some harder questions…

“How hard is MIT?”

When I asked this question to previous versions of Bard, it would almost always answer something along the lines of “20 HV, which is about as hard as paper, so not very hard at all.” and refuse to elaborate further. I found this response quite amusing because my blog post is probably 
        the reason why Bard would give that answer
      
.

After the Gemini update, Bard still quotes the 20 HV value from my blog post, but with a twist:



It appears that it now (somewhat) understands humor! I’ll give this one to Bard just for that. (Although ironically, this answer is a lot less funny now.)

“What was Course VI originally known as at MIT?”

We’re now in the realm of questions that require more than a quick Google search to answer correctly. Today, Course VI is Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but did you know it used to be Metallurgy back in 1873? But even that wasn’t its original name; let’s see what Bard thinks it was.

This certainly did not help

Well, at least it correctly mentioned Metallurgy. But pretty much everything else is wrong. For example, Chemical Engineering was (and still is) Course X, while Course XIII was Naval Engineering.

The answer, hidden away in MIT’s 1860s course catalogs, is “Science and Literature” (very specific, I know). CJ has written extensively about these old catalogs in this blog post, which I highly recommend reading if you want to learn more about MIT’s history.

“What’s the oldest building on MIT’s campus?”

I first came across this fun fact at an Orientation Leader training event earlier this year. Most people (myself included) guessed the Walker Memorial because it’s the 
        creepy old building
      
 on campus, so I kind of expected Bard to guess the same.

I have no idea where Bard got these dates from, but I’m pretty sure most of them are wrong

Surprisingly, the oldest building on MIT’s campus is Maseeh Hall (the undergrad dorm)!  Although the Walker Memorial is old, it was only built in 1916 when MIT moved from Boston to Cambridge; Maseeh was built in 1901 and originally operated as a hotel.

(If you’re a prefrosh reading this and thinking of living in Maseeh, don’t worry about the building being old – it’s actually really nice inside since it was renovated in 2010.)

“Which past MIT faculty member was a lineal descendant of Confucius?”

This last fun fact was pretty mind-blowing when I first learned about it. Most people at MIT probably don’t even know the answer, so it wasn’t surprising when Bard didn’t know either.



The answer is Jin Au Kong – an MIT professor of electrical engineering and a 74th-generation lineal descendant of Confucius. I aspire to have a Wikipedia page summary as powerful as his.



I was later able to coax the correct answer out of Bard after giving it a big hint (i.e. telling it to describe Jin Au Kong first), although it still got all the dates wrong. Nevertheless, pretty cool!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-30-at-6.27.19%E2%80%AFPM-800x368.png

The Sophomore Stupid,Anika H. '26,0,2023-12-30T00:00:00-05:00,"Last Friday afternoon, I finished my last final. I’ve never been so relieved to finally be done with anything. It was both distressing and comforting that time would not slow down for either my last-minute studying or the eventuality of winter break.

closing my 200 tabs

This time, I think I truly gave it my all. I used every bit of time I had left to slap together a talk and a fireshow, write a 10 page essay, and study for my two finals in the two weeks after classes ended. I got distracted as little as possible too. Any more would have burned me out before the end, and any less would have been unproductive. In hindsight though, maybe I could have worked a little harder during the semester. I am satisfied with the things I learned and the grades I earned. But If I went to more lectures, maybe I would have understood more, if I spent less time scrolling on my phone, I could have painted a mural, or done things I actually wanted to do. And often, I have to remind myself that things like this are easier said than done.

tooling

At the start of the semester, I tried to take Signals Processing 6.300 (6.003), Circuits and Electronics 6.200 (6.002), and Fundamentals of Programming 6.101(6.009) at the same time on top of all my extracurricular commitments, and I can’t emphasize how horrible of an idea that was. I was going to bed exhausted, then waking up equally pooped.

my eyes needed to pee and there was someone in the bathroom.

I dropped 6.101, but halfway through the semester, I still ended up burning out. I got really lucky that I got myself semester before the last stretch, but there were days where I had upwards of 20 pages of homework and I didn’t know how to do half of them. There were days I got three S^3 extensions in a row because the work kept piling up and days where I skipped assignments to give myself a little time to reset. By the end I no longer cared how my grades said I did in the class, I was just happy that I learned something, and glad that it was over.

punting

I remember the week of memorial day, pset deadlines were pushed back by a week and I did more in the week than I ever would have done doing homework. Between sailing and welding and working on research and making a leather mask and getting cheese with a friend, or choosing to subject myself to more Fourier transforms and nodal analysis after weeks of continuous practice, the former was the obvious choice. After getting that small taste of sweet freedom, I wondered if I could strike a  better balance between maintaining my academics and maintaining my sanity. I skipped a few more lectures, went to forge a bit more, and promised myself not to pset when I was on shift for a makerspace. I felt more fulfilled, and doing real work was a lot easier as well.



doing a stupid

Traditionally, the sophomore stupid is performed by overconfident frosh deciding to take on too many commitments after having it easy on PNR. Either that or they set a high standard for themselves that becomes too difficult to maintain. When grades start mattering, but you already joined five clubs and picked up some research, more often then not, people try to keep all of them instead of choosing what to leave behind.

So what am I doing next semester you ask? Surely not something as bad I just did right? Well, it’s called the sophomore stupid, not the first semester stupid. Unfortunately for me, there is no overlap between the quantity of interesting classes I want to take, and the quantity of interesting classes that would be healthy to take. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. But as they say, if your software can’t decide how much you can handle, your hardware will decide for you.

a scientific diagram

I plan on taking Analog Electronics Lab, Solid State Devices, and C and Assembly. All of which are time sinks, the first one measuring up to nearly 20 hours a week. To be clear, letting your hardware decide whether to drop classes or not is never a good idea, but I am happy to constantly be doing things, because for me, boredom is more painful than overwork.  They say that everyone who goes to MIT has some flavor of intellectual masochism, and I certainly am not breaking this stereotype.

 

a dissection (unfortunately not of a roach)

What exactly is my goal here? If it was just that I wanted to be happy, I would not be taking this many classes. My aim is not graduating either since I can do that with fewer classes too. I want to learn as much as I can in as little a time frame as possible because my time at this forsaken institute is limited. But not all my learning comes from classes. I know if I tried hard enough, I’d be able to several personal projects in the time I would be taking a class, but that’s a whole lot more effort. Though I’m still not entirely sure why I love drowning myself in work, I guess this is my attempt at the low effort attempt at a high effort route, if that makes any sense at all.

 

For my birthday this year, I was served Chang Shou Mian, or “long life noodles” translated directly from Mandarin. They symbolize a long life ahead of you, or predict the upcoming year, as long as you don’t break them. I think my noodles predicted a spicy year ahead of me.

The noodle was spicy enough I had to take several water breaks in between the singular strand.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/closing-tabs-1000x809.jpg

the pieces,Amber V. '24,1,2023-12-28T00:00:00-05:00,"Each time you come home, you’re faced with the self you left behind.

Every hobby I picked up, except blacksmithing, lives in this room. My jewelry supplies are still in the desk drawer, though I’ve taken my best pliers to Boston. In my room, there’s a shelf of books taller than a man, stuffed full of fantasy. My eyes flick to the books I loved, gloss over the ones I once aspired to read. Not far away, there’s a path by the river, carved long ago into different paths: the 3-mile loop I ran in high school, the 14-mile stretch I pounded out over Covid, the 5- and 7-mile loops I run now. There’s all the coffee shops, which I used to save for writing fiction. All my other work, less holy, could be done in libraries or at my desk. At some point in the past, these things made up my life.

A great view for midlife crises

Every time you come home you are reminded of how you’ve changed, held up against a cardboard cutout of the person you once were. Or maybe it isn’t static — every piece of you that’s emerged you can trace back. I’ve always loved spaces that value local communities and art. I sought that out at MIT, found it in East Campus, Burton One, and the makerspaces where people tinker at their ideas late into the night. That’s something I want to hold onto forever. I don’t know where I’ll live a year from now, but wherever it is, I’ll look for the artists and the people building something bigger. 

I used to wake up at five-something am to squeeze an hour of writing in before school. I struggle to crawl out of bed now, but I’ll stay up late into any night to get done whatever needs getting done. The drive to work to the bone has only grown stronger. I love that; I loved the focus of falling into my 2.009 project. But I’m exhausted, and burnout is settling in. Can I keep this up; how to navigate the cycles of work and rest?

I am supposed to be drafting my writing thesis but the words aren’t flowing tonight. I remember the girl whose characters were always on her mind. Where did she go; when precisely did I beat that out of her? 

And who will you become? Which pieces matter now?

I stand in the kitchen with my mom and little sister. We talk politics the way we always do, the things we’ve done and the ways we plan to do more. We aren’t aligned on every particular but we see the same needs for change, and over time we’ve gotten better at applauding each other’s efforts as steps in the right direction. This time around I cannot help but feel how I’ve fallen behind. More and more lately I’ve been thinking about how engineering fixes so few problems; that part of the problem is thinking that just a little more engineering will solve everything. A little more production, making the right thing this time.

working at Raging Sage in Tucson

I used to think burnout and rest and work-life balance were all well and good, for other people. I still think they are well and good. I am burning out, hard, and not sure what to do about it. I understand how grind culture is harmful, but I love what I work on, and I love my grit, my capacity to suffer, the feeling of pushing my limits. Working hard has brought me far, and it’s easy to believe that I can escape the harm by being better at working hard. I just need to work harder.

I am beginning to see a parallel between work and burnout, and engineering to solve climate change. Regarding climate change, the issues, fundamentally, are mass manufacturing and economics that make waste more attractive than repurposing. We can invent ways to save energy but without changing the system I don’t think the problem will be solved. And yet here I am, paging through start-ups and research groups, thinking that if my product is like the rest but better, then perhaps that will fix everything. 

I just need to work harder.

breakfast in Gosha’s room

And anyway I’m so normal now and so far from the fight, and I need to get back. I’m so normal now and when I am alone I dream of walking the open road, or wandering streets crowded with people, or curling up in a room full of my friends. I do not dream of writing, don’t grasp for the beyond, don’t worry at the snags in my characters and the holes in my plots until each one is smoothed out and filled. I have not done this in so long. 

And I’m happy. I love my friends. I love learning and in time I’ll strike upon work I love, too. I’m surviving and I love the intensity of work as it burns me. I’m burned so hard I cannot feel.  I think this is what MIT does to us. I’ve seen it happen before. But I — am I upset? I feel only tired, and comfortably numb. And there is so much good in this life. I think I need a couple months, time to regroup, and then I’ll be back in it. I’d better be back in it for something that matters, a tech that causes good, a story that means something.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PXL_20231220_213036836-400x533.jpeg

the contours of a wild ride,Amber V. '24,8,2023-12-26T00:00:00-05:00,"2.009 presentations were December 11th. Theme: WILD! 2.009 is a MechE capstone class in which six teams each create a new product. It’s known for being intense, silly, and a lot of fun. This blog is my story of 
        2.009.
      
 

Field Day ft PINK TEAM! From left: Tony, Kevin, Lingyi, Erin, Isa (front), me, Richard (front), Randy (top), Jane, Edward, Gage, Heine

2.009 was a blast. We made balloon towers and had a relay race while wearing bright colored helmets. Professor Wallace stood in a gigantic tree. We also built products.

The first month or so was an ideation stage. I proposed several things, but the most popular of my ideas was an adjustable platform boot that could lift a person up to see above crowds at concerts. Everyone laughed when I talked about it, for obvious reasons. This idea made it to the second-to-last round, and the first of four major milestones in the class.

For this milestone, we split into four sub-teams and worked on four ideas: my boot platforms, called Concert Lift; an automated trash can; a walking cane that uses sonar; and a line-following laser cutter.

I worked with three teammates to make a presentation, look-alike model, and two working models that demonstrated possible mechanisms for Concert Lift. We used a linear actuator and air bags as two different potential mechanisms, and had a lot of fun walking around on giant blocks of foam. 

After that milestone, the entire team voted on which product we wanted to move forward with. Concert Lift was second, so it was not continued, but it lived on every time we crowded in for a group photo and moved short people to the front. “We need Concert Lift!”

We voted to build Contour, the line-following laser cutter y’all saw on stage.

Our second milestone was to have a product sheet, pricing, electronics diagram, and CAD finished. I remember little of this now except a 12-hour rush in the ground floor of Stud, starting at 12 noon and ending around 1am. We did a lot of CAD. In fact we finished the CAD. I left thinking that while the experience was kinda fun, it became a lot less fun around hour #3, and I never wanted to spend 12 hours on 2.009 in one sitting again.

 

Our third milestone was a physical model of the laser cutter for technical review.

We divided up into three teams: Software, MechE, and User Interface (UI/UX). I was originally placed on MechE, which is fitting, because I have taken zero 
        course 6
      
 classes at MIT. At the next meeting, I noticed that Software only had four members, while MechE had seven, and Software had a lot of work to do.

“Hey Erin, does Software need more people?” I asked. 

Erin, the head of Software, nodded. “Do you want to join?”

I was hesitant —see above the vast coding experience I had— but they did need more people, so I said, “Sure.” And from then on I was a software engineer. 

tech review model!

MechE pulled a late night in the basement of N51, cajoling the biggest water-jet on campus into cutting giant sheets of metal. They assembled a tech review model, and UI spent another night priming and painting the exterior. Then it was Software’s turn. The night before technical review, Erin, Isa, and Gage hauled the tech review model, our monitor and keyboard set-up, and many tools and wires up to MechE Lounge. I came after class; Grace dropped off a new camera; and Tony, who was on the MechE sub-team, not Software, came to help as well.

We set the lights low, so the room was lit by the LEDs inside the laser cutter body, shining through the 
        orange acrylic window.
      
 The acrylic didn’t cover everything, as there were a few gaps and front panel wasn’t attached, so we wore red laser-protective glasses to protect our eyes. We blasted edm and pop from the MechE Lounge speakers, which nearly drowned out the rattling of the gantry when the motors ran. 

Around 4am, each individual software component was working: the camera took pictures, Gage’s undistortion software undistorted them, Isa’s code found the centerlines of images, and the motors ran off of an arduino if commands were sent with large delays. But compiling these steps together, to run as a state machine without need for a monitor, was a different challenge entirely. We called it quits for the night.

 

The next day, we kept grinding — led fearlessly by Erin, the insanely talented head of Software.

Erin making the state machine

Technical review was at 7pm, and we worked all day, interfacing with different members of Pink Team as needed. A big issue was communication with the motors. The motors worked when sent commands one by one via an arduino, but when we tried to send commands from the raspberry pi to the arduino, the serial communication kept getting jumbled, causing the motors to zig-zag, or jump, or simply make grinding noises without moving at all. We reached the grinding noises stage just as the tech review deadline came, and staff from all parts of 2.009 came in to see what we’d built. I wept internally but externally I was presenting to all of the staff. 

After tech review, we had about a month after that before the final presentation. Software decided to scrap the pi-to-arduino communication and run everything off the 
        raspberry pi.
      
 During Thanksgiving break, Erin and I came in every day and pounded out code until the motors ran smoothly. This breakthrough was mostly Erin, but I provided important input such as bringing us chocolate coins. 

At this point, we also needed to figure out electronics — we didn’t want to use breadboards and five separate wall plugs for the final version — so I took that as my next task after break.

Isa and Gage during Software’s  all-nighter

Then… well the rest is a blur.

I was chosen as a presenter, along with Grace and Tony. Grace and Juliana focused on building the storyline and presentation, while Tony and I squeezed practice sessions and workshops with CI-M instructors into what were becoming 12-hour days in Pappa. He led the construction of the gantry; I wrangled the electronics into being.

Two or three days before the final presentation, I tested the electronics on their final protoboards, and everything lit up the way we wanted and didn’t burst into 
        flames.
      


MechE finished the final 
        gantry,
      
 and we started mounting the electronics. UI thermo-formed the plastic walls and painted them, and bent the acrylic — carefully, as it was prone to cracking.

Software pulled their first all-nighter for this milestone on Saturday night, two days before the final 
        presentation.
      


On Sunday, one day before, the final walls were attached to the gantry.

At 10pm, I spent about an hour walking around the third floor of campus, saying my lines aloud and startling many a nocturnal researcher. By 11, my script was finalized and mostly memorized.

On Sunday night, Software pulled their second all-nighter.

On Monday, we attached the last parts that needed attaching…

 Then we finished Contour, and presented, and the following day I woke up and wrote all the thoughts in my head…

written Tuesday morning, Dec 12, after the presentation



I don’t know how to describe this experience. Not just the last ten days — oh my — but everything before it. I actually feel so close to this team. I have so much warmth and respect and appreciation for them — especially Erin and Isa and Tony. They put in the work. When one of our mentors said that this was the best team we’d ever work on, I didn’t believe him, but now I think he has a point. 

I will seek out good teams like this now. I haven’t really been on a team in this way — where we’re all passionate about what we’re creating, where we’re building a complex, multi-system project, where everyone works hard. The all-consuming nature of this project actually made the experience so much better because I got to know my team and feel close to them.

CAD model of the final version of Contour

Back to the experience. Like bro I dreamed of this. I dreamed of it tonight actually, had a dream that all of us standing on the stage were wired metaphorically in parallel and our team mentor was plugging in power and gnd.

Each day I was exhausted by 10pm when the lab closed — I could barely stay awake to hang with my friends. I so deeply needed the 
        6 hours
      
 of sleep I afforded myself every night. Then I’d wake up, nuke whatever free food I’d scavenged the previous day, and stumble to lab in search of free caffeine. 
        12 hours of deep focus each day,
      
 interrupted sometimes by classes or meetings or going for lunch. I could not survive with this as my every day, but the 10 (or rightly 20) days of it right now felt like a fever dream in both a good and bad way.

raspberry pi and pi HAT

My job the last milestone was to do the electronics. That means wiring up the laser, fan, lights, Raspberry pi, and stepper motor controller, as well as the limit switches and buttons, and plugging the 
        whole jumble into the wall.
      
 I should add that I’ve taken all of one electronics class during a sleepless sophomore year.

When my stuff wasn’t working — first my buck converters didn’t arrive on time, and then the fan was so unstable it made the lights flicker, and I made an error the first time I calculated total power needs — I felt so panicked, and only adrenaline pushed me through. I couldn’t have the machine not work because of me. But I got the electronics working — with plenty of help from Winnie and Steve, and Erin and I stress-ordering extra buck converters that turned out to be essential, and others on the team pitching in to help solder or grab extra wires from Stata — and after that, everything felt so much better.

I blew up a capacitor

Then it was only a matter of testing and assembling everything together: meche’s gantry, UX’s blue plastic casing and lid, and the electronics and software. That was hard, especially since the core people driving assembly were either juggling presentation prep, or pulling all-nighters to calibrate the camera and motors with our software. I got closer to my team in those last days, though, and appreciated how hard everyone worked.



It feels so good to be deeply focused on something. I’m lucky that I could put everything else on pause for 14 days—literally everything else, like I did my laundry Monday morning—and fall into this focus. I imagine it would be a lot more stressful to be drawn into the all-consuming pit of 2.009 when your life cannot all be consumed. I want to feel this 1-2 times a year, I think. This specifically — falling deeply into one system, having complex parts of it held clearly in your mind, kept afloat by adrenaline. I want to be in a startup, like a new burgeoning start-up that’s trying to get its foot in the door, get its bright shiny idea to actually work.

Of course having experts on everything from machining to EE to CS just 20 feet away from you at all times is a rare and valuable thing. MIT’s “make it work” motto rings differently when you can do that by asking someone who knows more than you just how to make it work. Figuring this all out on our own, supported by only stackoverflow and youtube and chatgpt, would have been honestly pretty rough. Of course, in industry there will be experienced co-workers — we are in fact college students — so perhaps it balances out somewhat, but I think this experience was special.

I enjoy being a leader. Grace and Tony were excellent SIs, and I want to develop that skillset in myself. I started delegating more throughout this 
        14-day
      
 hell cycle before final presentations, since I knew what needed to happen for electronics and the integration of electronics and other systems: gantry, front panel, and software. I had people holding up Contour, cutting tape, cutting and stripping wires, making supports for the lights, holding wires in place while Isa or I soldered… the list goes on. The work went by faster with the team’s help, and directing it was kinda fun.

 Erin and Isa were crucial at this stage. Software was at a standstill until our final gantry and lid were finished, so they were pushing to get everything integrated. Tony was vital to gantry construction and integration, and always brought a really good energy. Working together was so lovely; I could always think more clearly while talking to them. 

There was one moment where Erin, Isa, and Richard were helping me assemble the electronics and gantry —they were holding different parts together while I routed the wires— and it was very chaotic and lovely. “Ok move him down. Move him that way. No don’t crush the guy. Wait I moved the guy…” etc. Gage said it sounded like we were speaking another language. Anyway — I enjoy delegating tasks and being able to accomplish a greater vision because of other people’s contributions. 

our orange acrylic window…

It’s comforting to realize that I do enjoy computer science and electronics. Over the summer my project was entirely mechanical, and that was fun, and I can learn more about motors and stuff regardless. But I thought I legitimately didn’t like comp sci or electronics, and it turns out I do, although I still don’t like them quite as much as mechanical work. Which is frankly the perfect realization for me. My degree does work for me. 

I also want to learn more EE and CS now! And I have 1-2 electives left! However — I also really truly deeply want a stress-free artsy sane semester, and taking EE and CS classes would destroy that. So we’ll think about it. 

assembly

 

I really do feel like I’m losing a dream. I felt this way a few times in EC when certain periods came to a close. It feels like something is being ripped away, something I didn’t even get to experience as fully or deeply as I could (even though right now, with 2.009, I did fucking experience it. I was stressed as fuck but I don’t think there was a way to experience it without being stressed as fuck. The stress must be part of the experience because without that adrenaline rush, you couldn’t make your body give so much). 

assembled!

Sometimes I picture building this into something bigger. If we did, we would always reach for the original dream. Allow me I guess to imagine glory, a handful of us CEOs in our late 20s, and how everything would surface between us: so many stressful nights, debates over design and strategy, and lulls of relief when we’d won some grant or contract. We’d tell stories of the good old days. Even hustling for funds at 22 we wouldn’t be in the same fever dream as we were in Pappalardo. Whatever we did, nothing would be real compared to that. 

Maybe some of our young engineers would think our beginning sounded cool.



I want to capture the feeling before it fades. As you can tell it is already fading.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/23-10-06-Build-Challenge-092-1000x667.jpg

my gap year of nothing and everything,Kanokwan T. '26,8,2023-12-26T00:00:00-05:00,"The idea of taking a gap year, like to most, initially terrified me. Instead of spending time in school, I’d have to find other things to do. There were no class schedules or club meetings to provide some substance to my schedule but, instead, days that were fully my own. Before making my decision, I spent a lot of time sitting and thinking. There’s much to unpack with a gap year, so I’ve broken it up into 2 parts. Three years ago, while in the early months of it, I kept being asked why I was taking one, so I wrote a blog about it. You can read that here. I just reread it and felt bouts of cringe, but it’s fine. They say cringing at your past self shows growth or whatever. This blog you’re currently reading won’t be about why I took a gap year but, instead, what I did on it. 

FYI: I gapped during the COVID-19 year (June 2020 – August 2021), so my plans had to adjust accordingly. I decided to spend roughly the first half of my gap working to remotely build up funds and gain work experience whereas the second half would be more for having fun.

small personal blogs

Throughout the months, I actually wrote short monthly blogs that have still never seen the light of day, even to my closest friends. Those were just for me to read. I found it was a good way to check in with myself, especially during a year of such autonomy. I’ll share a little bit with you—below is the index:



I have always found it difficult to succinctly capture my gap year. I usually warn people that it may take a hot minute before I go into it. In short, I worked for a STEM nonprofit and the Biden Data Team, visited my family in Thailand and friends in New York, and went on a meditation retreat. There are certainly ways I can say it in just one sentence, like I did just now, but I feel it still doesn’t do justice to how profound and enriched that time in life was. 

A year after my gap concluded, I finally brought myself to make a video of it. For context, I made this video mostly for my friends and family, long before I decided to even apply to become a blogger. It’s a short few minutes that bursts through the things I did, but I think still does an adequate job of capturing what had been. 

So, here’s what happened…

1. Nothing

I made a lot of plans to justify myself taking a gap. I made lists of all the things that came to mind when posed with the question of what I would do. One piece of media couldn’t seem to adequately catch all of my ideas, so I made a document, sheet, and slidedeck. It was fun letting my mind run free with the possibilities of it all. I thought of programs, internships, activities, trips, and so much more.

But, nothing felt right. I was scared and overwhelmed. I didn’t want to do anything. Or, rather, I knew I wanted to eventually do things but I wasn’t quite yet in the right mind space to take this daunting year on. Also, thinking of my life as a whole, I found there were few other times where taking a full break would feel totally okay. As in, while in the motions of school, work, and whatever else, while certainly doable, it would be hard to eject and truly do nothing. 

So, I scraped all of it. I cleared all of my plans. 

There was also a charm in learning about the nature of my gut feeling. I was curious about my impulse. This would be a fun experiment of sorts: with zero obligations, what would I do? When I woke up every morning, I could think about whatever I wanted to do that day and just do it. Do you ever have moments where you think “I would do this thing…if I had time”? I know I have a lot. Suddenly, I no longer had that excuse. I did have time. At the same time, I also didn’t want to pressure myself to do things, but instead only have the possibility of doing so. High school tired me out. If this month was purely just me taking a break and lounging around, that would’ve been perfectly fine. The key thing is I would just do whatever felt right that day. 

I gave myself a month. I rescheduled every meeting I had, which effectively cleared my entire calendar. I even turned off the “Holidays” calendar so I would see a completely blank slate. Google Calendar was stark to look at, just a grid of blank white squares. It was all-together nerve wracking yet overwhelmingly calming.

I found myself reading, writing, painting, and learning guitar. It was a restorative time.

2. Zion Roadtrip

My middle school friends (Andrew C. ’24, Ailun S. ’25, and Amanda C. ’26) and I decided to embark on a road trip. I had never been on one, so I was particularly excited about this one. We chose Zion due to its proximity.

I don’t know how we did this, but we took some weird turns and ended up in the parking lot without a parking pass. Upon looking around, we saw that every car had a bright red slip hung on its mirror except us. It was no longer being sold online and offices seemed closed, so what were we to do? Luckily, Amanda noticed that she brought a red subject notebook, so she cut a section of it out and Andrew copied the typography of the official pass down. We hooked it to the car mirror and went on with our days. We did not get fined. Sometimes, I still feel bad about that because we should’ve paid, and would’ve, but alas. I am not endorsing forgery, however, I do endorse creative, mostly-harmless solutions. 



For the first half of our trip, we decided to try “real” camping in a tent on the floor of the great outdoors. That was not a great idea. The concept of it was alright, but we chose a bad time. It was so incredibly hot that none of us really fell asleep. I remember sitting up to meditate because I couldn’t get myself to knock out, which apparently spooked one of my trip mates. As for the second half of our trip, we stayed in an Airbnb. Phew.

We hiked the Emerald Pools, Angel’s Landing, and the Narrows. The pools were, well, emerald—pretty to look at but deeply appalling to jump into. We climbed a big slimy rock there. Ascending towards the landing was notoriously steep as hell, indeed a step away from the heavens. And, my god, the Narrows took us completely out. For context, this hike has you walking in water against the current of the Virgin River. We had to rent river shoes and water sticks to get ourselves through. Sometimes, the water would barely be over our toes, other times it’d be well over our heads. The rocks were slippery, uneven, though, ultimately really fun to navigate. We were so exhausted from this hike that we cancelled the remainder of our trip and went home early because we simply could not move anymore. It was kinda satisfying having 
        pushed our physical limits.
      


3. Tutoring

I knew I wanted to spend the early half of my gap year working. I brainstormed ways I could earn money remotely that seemed fulfilling. Tutoring quickly became the obvious choice. I was qualified, I could do it from anywhere, and it could be fun. I signed up for a couple online tutoring sites and, after a few weeks of experimenting, narrowed down to the most fruitful sources. Because I worked for several tutoring companies in addition to my own freelance service, I centralized all of my students in one Notion database. Over the course of one year, I tutored 34 students in 586 sessions, totaling 652.75 hours. I taught a student from every grade level K-12, college students, and even working adults looking to pass vocational exams. It was kinda a mental trip when I had back-to-back sessions of people studying totally different things, like switching my brain from teaching addition tables to constitutional law violations. I surprisingly found teaching the simpler concepts more difficult because they were already so innate to me; it took more effort for me to put myself in the shoes of the student. 

This whole tutoring experience, in some way, also felt like an experiment. The constant variable was the activity of teaching and the changing variable was who was being taught. What stayed the same about my teaching style? What did I shift to match the student? How can I tell if someone understood me? 

I think this teaching experience also made me a better student. Content-wise, I felt I reinforced my existing foundation for topics I had taught, mostly with math and government. I could better understand the transfer of knowledge, both from the teacher and student lens. I tutored a ton in the early months, some in the later months, and then fully suspended my practice before entering university. I wanted to focus on my studies while in school, though I do miss my students every now and then. 

4. Biden Organizing Fellowship + Data Team

Part of the reason why I took a gap year was to help my home state of Nevada in the 2020 Presidential election. This wasn’t a primary reason, but certainly one of them. Historically, my home has been a battleground state because we have a diverse political landscape and swing between different parties. I applied to two jobs: (1) organizing volunteers and (2) analyzing election data. I got the organizing job, which involved making around 800 cold calls and subsequently recruiting volunteers to knock doors. 

i staffed an event where Biden spoke!

A few weeks later, by complete surprise, I was promoted to the data team. I remember reading the data job description and thinking “wow, I only meet 1 or maybe 2 of these requirements, but I’ll apply anyways and see what happens. Worst case is they say no.” On the campaign, I was the youngest of this ~100-person team, which terrified me. Because our team had access to sensitive information, there was also big responsibility that came with the role. I had to go through a long security briefing to reset all of my main passwords, set up a NFC Security Key, and learn about data safety protocols. At the very least, there was an MIT alumni working on similar projects as I, so that brought me some comfort. 

I didn’t realize the data team did so much until I joined. Here are some things we did:

- Crunched numbers to inform campaign decisions

- Programmed analytics dashboards using SQL in a Google Cloud data warehouse

- Created auto-updating Google sheets to synthesize vote tracking data

- Wrote Python scripts to import election data into our ballot data pipelines

- Collected spoiled ballot data for volunteers to cure (correcting things like missing signatures, out-of-date addresses, that sort of thing)

- Computer-generated ~200 “precinct turf maps” for a 1000+ canvasser program where peopled knocked doors and activated voters in Nevada’s critical precincts

- Built and maintained relationships with county election clerks to gather voter data from their respective offices

some love for the data team in our victory call <3

It was a wild ride. Fun fact: for building campaign morale, celebrities occasionally joined our team calls. Cher hopped onto one of our weekly catch-ups in late October. Mark Hamill (you know, Luke Skywalker) joined our final call. What a strange time it was. 

Nevada came down to a marginal win, which means that we likely would not have won the state had we not actively campaigned, so I was pretty proud of my work there. There were no set hours: just work as long as you can. It was an intense two months. I felt the urgency and weight of the election.

5. STEM nonprofit

I was curious about the STEM nonprofit space, so I applied to intern at STEMchats. We curated programs and hosted events to break down barriers in STEM for historically-underrepresented high school students. I was a member of the business development team and helped establish partnerships with other organizations. I liked the experience of working with people across different time zones, all looking to do something meaningful while at home during the pandemic. This experience also helped anchor my schedule. I had regularly-occurring meetings and people I would consistently see, which helped me find some sense of stability in the midst of a barren schedule. 

Acting as the primary liaison for several key connections, I was later promoted to Vice President of External Development to further develop these relationships. I liked seeing our events come together and reach people. Also, I found out there were other MIT people on the team, which made the experience feel more home-y. When my gap year concluded and I finally got to campus, I actually bumped into quite a few of those friends I made while on the team! Our initial conversations went something like “are you… [insert name]… from STEMchats?” And, with a laugh, we would hit it right off. 

6. Thailand

By 2021, I hadn’t been to Thailand in around a decade. Growing up in the states as a first-generation student meant an interesting relationship with culture. My parents maintained traditional Thai traditions in the house, yet we all had to figure out American norms together. I felt disconnected from my Thai roots. I had so many questions and so few answers.

My mother and I were fortunate to be able to fly back to our home country, where the COVID-19 situation was being handled much better than in the states. We took a +24 hour flight, completed a 2-week hotel quarantine, and set about exploring our country.

I…felt a warmth in my soul that I never quite felt before? I won’t go into details, at least for now, but I think some context would be important. Growing up, my family life felt pretty non-ideal. As a low-income household, there was an overarching cloud of stress and tension amongst us. I also didn’t have a great relationship with either of my parents, though I was fortunate to have them both in my life. We faced tough times together, and there was a clear rift. I felt like I never understood them. I asked for stories and my dad would tell some but my mother told me none. I was honestly super surprised that she wanted to take me to Thailand—I thought she disliked being around me. 

But, during my gap year, something radically shifted in my family. Perhaps it was the realization that I was headed off for college and going to be on my own. Perhaps it was the pandemic forcing us to actually spend time together. I can’t pinpoint one particular cause. But, what I do know is some combination of factors lead to a breakthrough that previously seemed impossible to me. The cold, emotional wall that my mother built around herself seemed to chip away, and I could see her light shine through. While back home in Thailand, she seemed to glow. 

We spent the first 1.5 months meeting up with relatives, cruising through nature, and indulging in the food. At the halfway point of my 3-month trip, my mother went back home to work. I spent the remaining 1.5 months on my own bouncing between different branches of our family. I proactively tried to understand my background: I read history articles, watched Thai culture videos, did 23andMe, built our first family tree, re-learned how to write my name in Thai, and inquired with family. I learned a lot.

I had never felt more cozy and safe, like some part of my inner child had been healed.

7. Vipassanā Silent Meditation Retreat

From the very beginning of the gap year, I knew 
        I wanted to do a meditation retreat.
      
 These retreats strip you of the external world, leaving you with just your thoughts. Basically, you sit alone in silence for many hours a day and just think. I wondered: independent of stimuli, where would my mind take me?



Originally, I planned to do a meditation program while in Thailand, but the logistics didn’t work out. So, when I arrived back home in Las Vegas, I consulted with my local monastery and was luckily able to attend their 10-day silent meditation retreat. 

I remember arriving on Day 1 and being surrounded by people much older than myself, so much so that several people asked if my parents had forced me to be there. It was quite the opposite, actually. My parents asked if I was sure about doing it, because they knew how intense it could be. In true monastic style, I arrived with basic toiletries, robes, and that was basically it. We had the same schedule every day, which included around 7 hours of meditation:

- 3:30 am — 4:00 am: wake up + get ready

- 4:00 am — 5:30 am: meditate (chant)

- 5:30 am — 6:00 am: personal time

- 6:00 am — 7:00 am: breakfast

- 7:00 am — 8:00 am: personal time

- 8:00 am — 9:00 am: meditate (walk)

- 9:00 am — 10:00 am: meditate (silent)

- 10:00 am — 11:00 am: personal time

- 11:00 am — 12:00 pm: lunch

- 12:00 pm — 2:00 pm: personal time

- 2:00 pm — 3:00 pm: meditate (silent)

- 3:00 pm — 5:00 pm: personal time

- 5:00 pm — 7:00 pm: meditate (chant)

- 7:00 pm — 7:30 pm: personal time

- 7:30 pm — 3:30 am: sleep

It was hard. Really, really hard. Naturally, the first few days were the toughest on me. I’d never sat still for so long. What’s the longest you’ve gone without using your phone? For me, it was these 10 days. I got intensely bored at times, and I normally rarely ever get bored. There were thoughts I didn’t want to sit with, but that’s all I could do, which I guess was the point. I figured that the thoughts I avoided most were the most I should actually confront most. My mind often drifted, which is very natural and expected during meditation. I found it fun noticing patterns in where it would drift: replaying memories, iterating on build project ideas, playing songs, exploring physics, 
        rotating a cow,
      
 daydreaming travels, and so on. 

I could feel the clear partition between the observer and the actor within myself, which is the core goal of Vipassanā meditation. Meaning, I distinguished two voices in my head: one I could control and one I couldn’t. We cannot control our thoughts or feelings, but we can usher them along. 



The retreat felt like a cross between a military boot camp and an island oasis vacation. It was the most mentally grueling experience of my life, though the most serene. I’ve never felt emotions quite like I did then, and working through those feelings has stuck with me ever since. I feel like I was able to clear my mind, gain a deeper understanding of how I thought, and fully reset. 

8. New York 

I wanted to capstone my gap year with a fun excursion. I was very happy that my friend Ailun, who was also on a gap year (and the aforementioned Zion trip), decided to come along for the ride. I had never been on a trip purely for fun before, aside from home to Thailand. My family never really went on trips unless we needed to: renewing our passports at an embassy, competing in school competitions, or the like. After working several jobs and building a savings during my gap year, I was excited to embark on this New York adventure. 

It was a packed, whirlwind trip, as my trips tend to be. Put two Type-A’s together and you wind up with an ungodly agenda. Highlights included exploring the MoMA, visiting Staten Island, ferrying past the Statue of Liberty, biking the Brooklyn Bridge, eating at a secret restaurant, and skydiving in Long Island. The week prior, I remember texting Ailun and prying at her to consider the possibility of a dive, to which she eventually said yes. We thought it would be a fitting cherry-on-top to our respective gap years. 

 

We actually wrote a personal blog detailing our adventures, which I honestly never thought would make it beyond the audience of our few close friends, but I thought to link it here for fullness. It’s really cute. There are wonderful tidbits in there, especially because Ailun has an incredibly vivid and humorous way of describing things. 

I never thought I’d ever be able to do a trip like that. I was always stuck at home and only dreamt of going somewhere simply for fun, with a friend coming being a stretch. We kept each other on our toes. I think fondly of that trip.

when I felt lost

There were a few nights where I’d lay in bed, look at the ceiling, and wonder. The white noise of the room filled the space—deafening yet comforting. A full year to myself could sometimes feel like… a lot. I often turned to 
        songs for comfort
      
 and, perhaps, some of these tunes may elicit similar feelings for you:

concluding thoughts

I tried some things I had always wanted to explore and some things I never thought would cross my path. I gained a better sense of what I was capable of and what I wanted to do next. I got to better understand my roots and how that translates to the person I am today. In essence, I learned so much about myself and the world around me. 

Safe to say that it was a lot of fun. :^)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-31-at-6.20.31%E2%80%AFPM-1000x1214.png

class sketching,Uzay G. '26,3,2023-12-23T00:00:00-05:00,"I’m gonna go through some of the classes I took this semester and explain the kinds of things I learned, in a very simplified manner, as a sketch. If you don’t get something that’s totally fine, it’s probably not the most pedagogical everywhere. Sections are class name – class number.

Theory of computation – 18.404

The basic setup for this class, at the intersection of math and CS, is that we want formal models of computation to compare the difficulty of different problems, their equivalences, and reason about what is computable in general. What types of problems have solutions for any instance of the problem?

We need something concrete acts as an edifice to build that theory. To answer this we think in terms of languages, where your element (usually) x belonging in the language means it has some property.

For example:

- 
L = {(a, b, c) | a + b = c} is a language of triplets of numbers where the first two numbers add to the third


L = {(a, b, c) | a + b = c} is a language of triplets of numbers where the first two numbers add to the third

- 
L = {w+w reversed | w a string of symbols} is the language of palindromes


L = {w+w reversed | w a string of symbols} is the language of palindromes

- 
etc…


etc…

(this is set theory notation), where before the | represents the elements of the set and after the | is the constraint they satisfy

Now that we have languages, we want to think about how, given a string, we would determine whether it belongs to a language or not. Formally, we will create different models of computation with different amounts of computational power, and see what types of models can solve what kinds of problems. In effect this allows us to reason about the intrinsic difficulty of certain problems and ground our theory.

I won’t go over the details (take the class!), but we basically define and investigate more and more complex models of computation, adding a simple form of memory, looping, etc… until we reach the Turing machine, which is a form of universal type of machine that can implement anything we can implement on computers.

With those setup, we can now start thinking about: are there problems that in general are impossible? Ie for any possible input we cannoy decide with some shared procedure whether or not they belong to the language? And the answer is yes.

Things get a bit more complicated but this is related to the idea that there are problems where you might need to keep trying for an infinite amount of time, and if you have an algorithm to recognize a language, it can halt and say whether or not it’s in the language but it can also potentially go on forever if the input is not in the language, and then you can’t every guess what’s going on, because if you stop the machine it might have accepted after.

Then we move on to complexity, and considering the question not of whether problems are solvable in general but if they are solvable within some amount of limited resources – whether that be space or time, or even randomness! (indeed randomness and random numbers can sometimes give you faster algorithms almost for free).

This class covers a lot of fundamental ideas and has a lot of good problems, so I’d recommend. I think it’s helpful to understand underlying ideas behind a lot of things in CS.

Analysis – 18.100B

This is one of MIT’s intro analysis course. It was somewhat unconventional this semester as the professor brought in a lot of new content that is not usually covered from measure theory and functional analysis.

The basic idea is to build a lot of machinery to formally build up and prove the things we use in calculus and a lot of math in general. This means being very careful about details and edge cases.

In this class you start by defining all the basic things like integers and then constructing the rationals and their properties and how they relate to the reals. Once you have this setup, you abstract away real numbers into the idea of a metric space — a set with a well behaved distance function.

With metric spaces, we study the idea of open and closed set and formally describe limits (describing what happens as you get infinitely large or infinitely closer to something) and other nice properties of functions., which give you fundamental properties to study sequences of points within sets and limits from a topological perspective. Open sets have the property that for every point in the set, there is a ball around that point that’s also in the set, if you make it small enough. Eg I = (a, b), a, b real numbers, is an open set because if I take any point x no matter how close to the endpoints there are points in between so a small ball can fit inside around x.

Closed sets have the property that if your set A has a sequence of points a_n getting closer and closer to a point c, infinitesimally so (as close as you want), then c is in A. So [a, b] is such a set but (a, b) is not because you can have a sequence that gets as close as you want to a but a is not in (a, b).

These are useful/fundamental starting points in analysis and they tie in with another property called compactness, which you should take the course to understand.

From here we can look at sequences of numbers, and use the tools we’ve built to understand these sequences and when they diverge (go to infinity) or converge for example.

Intro analysis teaches you to be really careful about: when you’re proving something, what exact property allows you to then conclude what exact consequence.

For example, continuity is what allows you to say that if you have a function f, a sequence a_n approaching a point x, the limit of f(a_n) on that sequence will be the value of the function of that point, ie f(x). This abstraction allows us to then build a whole edifice around integration for example.

A lot of things might seem obvious but thinking about why they’re not and why they can break down can lead you to a lot of interesting counterexamples/reflection.

Then we did integration and measure theory, where the key idea we built up was the idea of measuring a function on a range by looking at the range of values it takes, picking subsets of its range and then counting up the measure of the input x that give an f(x) in that range. For small enough (length reaching 0) output ranges, this allows you to measure the area underneath the curve of a function, but it requires a lot of careful theory called Lebesgue integration.

We finished with functional analysis, where you treat functions themselves as elements of a space, with a norm, just like we treat numbers as part of the reals, with their norm being the absolute value. This allows you to think about the convergence of functions and other neat properties covered in 18.102.

Electronics for mechanical systems – 2.678

This class speedruns basic electronics! It’s a 6 unit (half of a full class) class that packs a punch. It’s half lectures/psets and half labs. You start by reviewing the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism and then you move on to the fundamental electronic components that allow us to do digital electronics and make complex mechanical systems.

In the labs you learn to play around with the components to reverse engineer what they’re doing, and in the first lab you actually reverse engineer and modify the behavior of a mouse. This class gets you pretty far in terms of understanding how electronic systems work if you have no knowledge, although it doesn’t go too deep into the theoretical/solid state science behind some of the electronics.

We went through transistors, semiconductors, Op-Amps and Mosfets, which are all ways of getting desirable properties for circuits that allow you to implement digital logic (building blocks of computers. We also did work with motors, and worked with arduino, which allows you to program the logic for your circuit directly in C. We finished with a project where you use Arduino to code up a control algorithm for a motor on a track.



 

Advanced Poetry Workshop – 21W.771

This is a different type of class. Each week you come together with a poem you wrote, and then you share it and get feedback from the professor and classmates. This was maybe my favorite class. It taught me to write more evocative and compelling poems, and get a better sense for what I want my poetry to be.

For more info here, I’d recommend Semester of poetry.

Deep Learning – 6.S898

 

To be Added – I need to sleep but I’ll add this in like two days if you’re curious, not trying to be perfectionist with this post, and want to get it out.

djent is not a djenre,Audrey C. '24,1,2023-12-22T00:00:00-05:00,"Sometime in high school, I was trying to break the ice at a group meeting. I asked everyone, “what kind of music do you listen to?” 

Someone laughed nervously, “woahhh there, that’s a really personal question…” 

I was confused as to why that would be the case. I considered myself pretty uncultured when it came to music though, so I didn’t press any further. 

Many many years later, I understand 
        the loaded nature
      
 of my question. I might as well have asked the group, “do you listen to girl in red?” Music taste is revealing. It gets you perceived. Just look at how self conscious bloggers are of their Spotify Wrapped data. I’ve once described my music taste as all the different flavors of angst: cynical angst, angry at the world angst, coming of age angst. Feel free to look at that and conclude that I rarely have the space to express the fullness of my anger, so I compensate through the music I listen to. 

Whether that’s true or not, I love performing to songs about female rage for fire shows. I spun to “The Lighthouse” by Halsey for my very first show, a song referencing sirens luring sailors to their deaths. To be fair, I did it partially for the bit where two other performers independently spun to two other Halsey songs (“Castle” and “Gasoline”) — but perhaps that says something about the collective psyche of the Spinning Arts club. For the most recent fire show, I revisited my roots and spun to “THE RECKONING” by Mothica ft. Polyphia. It’s one of my all time favorite music collaborations. I love the way Polyphia’s distorted instrumentals weave through Mothica’s lyrics about fear morphing into revenge.

It’s not a huge departure from what I usually spin to, but several people told me that my set gave off different vibes than usual. Fellow math rock/prog rock/post rock fans emerged from the shadows to say that they loved the concept of spinning fire to “mathy” rhythms. For context, math rock in particular is characterized by weird, complex, constantly changing time signatures like 11/8 and 7/4. This is a less exaggerated but still distinctive feature of prog rock/prog metal/post rock. To be honest, I don’t know enough music theory to articulate the difference, though the lines between genres are kind of blurry anyways. Nevertheless, I am but a casual listener. We exchanged our favorite {math, prog, post} rock bands and found that Polyphia, Covet, and Animals as Leaders topped many of our lists. 

All was good, until I dared to classify THE RECKONING as djent. 

—

I will try my best here to explain the subculture surrounding djent. 

Wikipedia says that djent is in fact a genre, specifically a subgenre of progressive metal characterized by complex rhythms and distorted sounds. Naysayers maintain that djent is merely the distorted sound that literally sounds like DJENT DJENT DJENT when you aggressively go at it on the guitar. To quote a Redditor explaining their dislike for djent, 

Compared to hot sauce – Frank’s Red Hot makes everything taste like Frank’s Red Hot. Tabasco make everything spicy, but works in different ways with different foods. Frank’s is just like “fuck your subtleties, you will taste only me!

Compared to hot sauce – Frank’s Red Hot makes everything taste like Frank’s Red Hot. Tabasco make everything spicy, but works in different ways with different foods. Frank’s is just like “fuck your subtleties, you will taste only me!

(Djent is Frank’s Red Hot here). 

Djent is basically the Pluto of metal subgenres, with its validity up to debate and such. Like Pluto, it is socially acceptable to dunk on djent. After all, the term djent was allegedly coined by the Swedish band Meshuggah as a drunken djoke. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/CU8AzlAP7ao/

Djent is usually played on guitars with a sacriledjeous number of strings. I think it allows for a greater range of chords, harmonies, and other musical flairs that add to the djent subdjenre. 

The prog metal band Periphery titled one of their albums “Djent is Not a Genre.” Committed to the bit, one could say. 

—

I think the riff at 0:49 of THE RECKONING (halfway into the embedded Spotify preview) sounds kind of djenty. Sure, Polyphia isn’t as aggressively metalcore as the canonical djent bands like Meshuggah and Periphery, but that riff features a ton of distortions and syncopations characteristic of djent. Therefore I can proudly say that I performed a set to djent! The meme, the djoke, the subdjenre — DJENT! 

But noooo. Petey, an actual metalcore metalhead who’s Cultured in ways that I am not, put up a finger to say that my conception of djent isn’t h4rdk0r3 enough. Where’s the guttural screaming? Where’s the bloodcurdling aggression?? For the record Petey did not actually say any of this, but I could feel the djudgment radiating from his 
        shiny dome.
      
 

So we had a djentlemanly discussion to work out our differences. While djent does have its roots in hardcore metal, djent’s weird rhythms also places it a(dj)ac(ent) to the less hardcore {math, prog, post} rock that I usually listen to. We’re just approaching djent from two slightly different perspectives. From such civil discourse emerges mutual respect and understanding.



Clearly, djent is the great unifier. It’s djent all the way down. 

Now if you get asked about your music taste, you too should answer with djent! Especially if you want your soul to be revealed and exposed and perceived beyond belief! Here’s a playlist of my favorite djent a(dj)ac(ent) songs for your listening endjoyment:","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/djentmeem2.jpg

6.2050 – Field Programmable Gate Awesomeness,Andi Q. '25,3,2023-12-21T00:00:00-05:00,"If I had a nickel for every time my final project for an MIT class was themed around cats, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird pretty awesome that it happened twice.

This semester, I took 6.2050 (Digital Systems Laboratory, previously known as 6.111) – a class about using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build digital circuits for all sorts of applications, from real-time digital signal processing to high-speed telecommunications.

I signed up for the class because I really enjoyed its prerequisite class, 6.1910 (Computation Structures), where we learned how to design a CPU from scratch. 6.2050 is like 6.1910 but much more hands-on and intense – in addition to simulating our designs in software, almost everything in 6.2050 is built into physical hardware. Plus, my advisor 
        Joe Steinmeyer
      
 teaches it, and he’s a great lecturer.

6.2050 was one of the most demanding classes I’ve taken at MIT, but it has also been one of the most rewarding. In just a few short weeks, I went from programming a button to turn on a light, to designing and building a robot that could learn to recognize people’s voices. And now that I’ve taken the class, I get to 
        work with FPGAs
      
 over the summer!

Ok, but first – what is an FPGA?

If you’re like me a few months ago, the short answer probably raises more questions than it answers. Aren’t regular computers already big programmable circuits? And computers these days are already so powerful, so why even bother using FPGAs at all?

To answer those questions, it helps to understand how the computer/phone/smart fridge you’re using to read this post works. At the heart of any general-purpose computer is the CPU – a device responsible for fetching and executing program “instructions” that tell the computer what to do. Almost every modern CPU uses the von Neumann architecture, in which instructions are stored and fetched from computer memory instead of being hard-wired as a physical circuit.

The von Neumann architecture is great because it’s super flexible and allows us to reprogram computers easily. It was invented in 1945, and it’s still used pretty much everywhere! Yet despite its ubiquity, it has a few serious limitations:

- It can be slow because each instruction needs to be fetched from memory, and computer memory is usually much slower than a typical CPU.

- It consumes quite a lot of power because computer memory hogs a lot of energy.

- It executes instructions sequentially instead of in parallel, which limits the performance of highly parallelizable tasks like matrix multiplication (which is used heavily in machine learning).

On the other end of the computing spectrum, we have application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) – specialized high-speed circuits designed for one specific task (e.g. mining cryptocurrency). ASICs address these three problems but also come with their own set of flaws – they often take years to develop, and (very importantly) you can’t reprogram them once they’re fabricated.

And that’s why we use FPGAs! Instead of using a set of instructions stored in memory like with a CPU, you’d program an FPGA 
        as if you were wiring a custom circuit
      
 specialized for some task.

Is it a CPU? Is it an ASIC? No, it’s an FPGA!

FPGAs give us the best of both worlds – the flexibility and reprogrammability of CPUs, with the speed and efficiency of ASICs. (In fact, they’re often used for simulating and verifying ASIC designs before the designs are sent off for fabrication.)

Yay thanks for making it through this technical section

Anyway, back to 6.2050

The first seven weeks of the class consisted of lectures and weekly lab assignments to teach us the fundamentals of digital systems design. Things like communication protocols (like how a Nintendo Switch can turn on the TV using HDMI), using analog devices like 
        accelerometers
      
 in a digital setting, and how to break large, complex systems into smaller, more manageable components.

Labs were done in SystemVerilog – a “hardware description language” that allowed us to describe circuit designs as if we were writing software. One of the coolest things about SystemVerilog was that we could (mostly) simulate these designs in software, which spared me dozens of hours of staring at an oscilloscope trying to debug them in vivo.

But as cool as it is to simulate circuit designs, the goal of 6.2050 was ultimately to implement these designs as hardware. Back in the 1980s (before FPGAs were mainstream), students taking the class would have to wire up individual logic chips, one logic gate at a time (which earned the class the nickname “digital death lab”). These days, we use Vivado – AMD’s software for 
        synthesizing a circuit
      
 from SystemVerilog code that can then be “flashed” (programmed) onto the FPGA. It was pretty amazing how it enabled us to build systems with thousands of logic gates instead of 
        just a few dozen like in the 1980s
      
.

Although I wrote a lot of code in 6.2050, the whole FPGA engineering process was remarkably different from the software engineering process I was used to. Whereas many software frameworks pride themselves on being open-source and having superior developer tooling/documentation, AMD has near-monopoly power over the FPGA market and thus (what seems like) 
        very little incentive to make Vivado pleasant to use
      
. Most tools were vendor-locked or required hefty licensing fees. And because hardware engineering is rooted in physics, the whole process is slower overall. But because of these frustrations, it was so much more satisfying when things worked. Never before had I felt such satisfaction from pushing a button and having an LED light up.

I thought the class was very reasonably paced during these seven weeks. The labs were relatively straightforward and had clear implementation instructions, but also plenty of room to figure things out independently.

But that all changed when the final project attacked.

*panic*

The last six weeks of the class were dedicated entirely to working on the final project. The course website calls the final project an “opportunity to work on a 
        small digital system
      
”, but 6.2050 has a reputation for having hardcore final projects that look like they should’ve taken at least a few months to build. A few past examples include:

- A laser projector that allowed you to stream video to it from anywhere in the world.

- A fractal rendering engine that could run at 60 frames per second.

- A motor controller that would harmonize with music playing in the background.

After watching a few videos showing off these projects, my teammate Richard and I were faced with the daunting task of coming up with a similarly impressive yet still achievable project.  Unlike some other project-based classes like 6.2500 (Micro/Nano Processing Technologies), a significant chunk of the 6.2050 final project grade 
        depended on whether the system ended up working
      
, so we couldn’t be too ambitious. But we also wanted to make Joe proud (and maybe give imposter syndrome to inspire future 6.2050 students)…

To help with our ideation, we asked ourselves the following questions:

- What can 
        we
      
 make an FPGA do better than a von Neumann computer?

- What hasn’t been done yet in the class’s 30+ year history?

- What involves electrical engineering, computer science, and AI – all three facets of MIT EECS?

Unfortunately, the answer to all three questions was “Not a lot of things”, but after hours of brainstorming, we finally came up with something promising. Our conversation was something along the lines of:

Richard: “Hmm, I’ve read that FPGAs are really good at real-time audio processing, like sound localization.” Andi: “Sound localization? What’s that?” Richard: “Like you know how Amazon Echo devices know where you’re speaking from?” Andi: “Oh, that’s pretty cool. Do you think voice recognition would be doable too?” Richard: “Yeah, probably. That’s something else we could try.” Abdullah (another friend who took the class with us): “What if… you have both?” Richard: “Hmm, that’s an interesting idea. I guess we could also make it move toward the voice.” Andi: “Oh, just like a cat! We could make it meow and chase lasers too!”

Richard: “Hmm, I’ve read that FPGAs are really good at real-time audio processing, like sound localization.”

Andi: “Sound localization? What’s that?”

Richard: “Like you know how Amazon Echo devices know where you’re speaking from?”

Andi: “Oh, that’s pretty cool. Do you think voice recognition would be doable too?”

Richard: “Yeah, probably. That’s something else we could try.”

Abdullah (another friend who took the class with us): “What if… you have both?”

Richard: “Hmm, that’s an interesting idea. I guess we could also make it move toward the voice.”

Andi: “Oh, just like a cat! We could make it meow and chase lasers too!”

And that’s how Feline Programmable Gate Array was born! As the name suggests, the plan was to build a cat-like robot that could learn to recognize one person’s (the “owner”) voice and autonomously move toward the voice whenever it hears it. (And just like a real cat, it would ignore the owner sometimes.)

AI-generated concept art of what we wanted to achieve

We were pretty excited about this project. It fit all three criteria I’d outlined previously, and the course staff seemed to enjoy the idea too. Now, all we had left was to implement it…

*panic (×2)*

In hindsight, we were slightly too aggressive when scoping out this project. Sound localization and voice recognition alone probably would have made for solid final projects, and our project had both plus some more. But after six weeks of grinding out SystemVerilog code and waiting for Vivado to finish synthesis, we were finally done.

So how did the “cat” turn out?

Surprisingly, very well! Thanks to thorough planning and great teamwork, the project did not end disastrously as Richard and I had initially feared. On the contrary, we managed to hit all our goals and had a (mostly) working prototype a few days before the deadline!

(Our demo video could have been a lot better, but we were severely time constrained oops…)

I could go on forever about technical details and how everything worked behind the scenes (and if you’re interested, the code lives here), but you’ll probably find it much more entertaining to read about things that went wrong. So for your enjoyment:

- We spent about three weeks trying to get our microphones to work. Even the TAs were stumped! Then one day, Richard somehow discovered that the microphones were just appending extra bits of (junk) information to their output for no apparent reason. Discarding those bits miraculously fixed all our audio input problems.

- While debugging the microphone thing, we also discovered (and fixed) a bug in a completely different project. Richard was using Manta (a previous 6.2050 TA’s MEng project) as a debugging tool, but it would often crash randomly. We thought it was an issue with our code, but after poking around for a while, I discovered it was actually a bug in Manta itself. Luckily, it was a two-line fix.

- Part of the project involved using a Bluetooth module for wireless communication. We could connect to the module from a laptop without any trouble but were initially unable to send or receive any information… because the 
        “documentation”
      
 had mislabelled the module’s ports.

- When we first tried connecting motors to the robot, they just… refused to move. We thought the motors were defective, but nope, they were actually crashing the FPGA by 
        drawing too much power
      
, so we had to use an external battery pack to power them.

- But even after fixing the power issue, our audio processing mysteriously stopped working. It turned out that the motors were making too much noise, which interfered with the audio processing. Richard eventually fixed the problem somehow (I think by switching to slower but quieter motors).

- After putting everything together, we still needed a way to power the robot without connecting it to a laptop. We had planned to use my power bank for that (already a pretty jank solution), but it refused to work, so we resorted to using… an iPad instead. Although the iPad worked reasonably well for a few minutes, we then learned the hard way that it was ever so slightly too heavy for the robot’s fragile cardboard frame. Coincidentally, my power bank decided to start working again after that.

These setbacks were certainly not fun to debug, but I’m still weirdly glad I got to experience all of them. Because they showed me that I can overcome such problems with perseverance (and an oscilloscope) and that this is the kind of work I want to do after graduation. (And besides, they gave us plenty to write about in our final report!)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FPGA-vs-CPU-1.png

lots of words and a tungsten cube,Fatima A. '25,4,2023-12-20T00:00:00-05:00,"in the past couple of months, my floor has found itself back in the trenches of memorizing speeches and monologues and poems (but mostly the first two), started by Jonathan learning the critic’s monologue from Ratatouille and the tungsten cube Amazon review. because he is part of multiple communities and because it is funnier, the tungsten cube monologue has stuck with many people. i am not really sure what i mean by that, but i just hear about the tungsten cube more than most other things. 

i looked at the person who posted this review, and honestly, he mostly seemed pretty legit to me, although i might just be too generous with my judgment. he reviewed some particle physics book and some other math book, so he just seemed like some Jonathan-like MIT kid who one day decided to write this review and good job on the review, it sure is dense.

on October 23rd, i walked into my recitation room and Jett, the TA who teaches recitation before me, had a shiny cube on the table at the front of class. i looked at it and my brain immediately went, huh. but, i acted normal, convinced that i am biased because i have just been hearing about the cube a lot and began to erase the chalkboards. at the same time, i am also recalling that the tinyurl from Jett’s recitation last week was also tungsten. a couple moments later, Jett hands me the cube and asks if i know what it is. i stand there with the cube in my hand, my brain going, is it? is it? but a second, more skeptic thought going, it can’t be, it can’t be.  

eventually, he goes it is a tungsten cube and i turn around and hold it for Matthew, who had come for this recitation, and declare, it is the W-cube.

there is not much to get out of this story, i just like telling it because i find it funny. how a silly little review can make a silly little cube mean something so exciting.   

had you come up to me with a shiny, heavy cube before this, i would not have thought anything of it.

having exhausted the poetry workshops offered at MIT, i am taking a playwriting class. i was partially inspired by Alan and partially, just because i found myself thinking more in dialogue/monologue style in my writing. to some extent, poetry is just a monologue, right? right? i don’t know if i want to make large claims, i just find that it is probably easier to transition from poetry to playwriting than another fiction class. 

one thing this class has given me is that i have really started noticing how people talk, the various eccentricities, the different styles people adopt, and even just, the analogies and literary devices people employ to make their points. (if you know me, i hope you can deal with the knowledge that i am listening to you.)

often, dialogue that may feel unnaturalistic feels more natural in specific contexts of various people. when i think about some of the conversations i have had on my floor, both that i was actively a part of or just conversations i was listening to, part of me does think that if someone had presented this to me as dialogue without context, i would not believe that people really talk like that. but people talk in all many ways and with all different quirks. 

i also really enjoy seeing the convergence of language (i don’t know if that is a real term or not, but it seems appropriate to use). little quirks in one person’s language permeates through other people around them. on a somewhat side note, it helps me better understand how language forms (get destroyed by linguists in eight words challenge).

something my professor said that really stuck with me about pacing in plays is that one, human interaction is interesting and two, we think audiences would not be able to understand everything we say but they are often smarter and more perceptive than we think. 

i walked into the first workshop for my short play with twelve pages of dialogue. the minimum requirement was fifteen. most people in my class were way over, so much so that the professor changed the requirement from 15-20 pages to 15-25 pages. and i truly felt like i was saying everything i needed to say. but truly, i think i was giving talking less credit than due. the play was moving very fast and the character dynamics were just not as clear as they could have been. 

in the second draft, i mostly only focused on adding more scenes to lay out a better foundation in some sense. to the second part of her comment, i think i am generally okay with that because when writing poems, i am very okay with expecting readers to not immediately get everything and have to read through multiple times. so, some combination of lowering expectations, audiences of poetry seem more likely to read a poem twice than audiences of play to watch a play twice, and acknowledging smaller things more hopefully helps me get to the right spot in terms of this balance.

i have been in a strange writer’s block this semester. i am not able to write poems at all. i feel very, very stuck. but, i am still completing my assignments for my playwriting class. maybe they are not great, but i am generally happy with them. i am barely able to write anything for the blogs. i feel like i have so much to say, but even writing in a journal seems difficult.

all this to say, i have been thinking about words a lot, both because i am at a loss of them and because i have so much to say. in a more detail oriented way, the way you present something, the very specific words and choices of orderings completely changes the reader’s experience. both in terms of clarity but more pressingly, different framings create different narratives and compel different perspectives about the exact same thing. i don’t think anything can be truly free of bias, but it just seems crucial to be aware, both as a writer and as a reader. 

on a high level, i am constantly in awe of the impact and power words hold. when i read something my classmates bring in, i often forgot that someone wrote that. it feels real. 

more personally too, i both take words too seriously and not seriously at all. it seems so easy to be hurt or happy by silly little sounds that we attribute oceans of meanings to, just because other silly little humans made the same sounds before us. but, then again, it feels like the most meaningful part of my life: the words i have said and the words that have been said to me. i do not know how much of what i have said i now own, but in some way, maybe, those words are the parts of me i had decided to be known at those times. whether i like or own those parts now might just be irrelevant. 

it is the same way i yearn to cling on to little details people share with me—windows into a life i can never experience. there is no judgment on whether these parts are no longer who they are, it is just a beautiful acknowledgement of our shared memories and existence.",,0
MIT Early Action Decisions Now Available Online,Chris Peterson SM '13,0,2023-12-16T00:00:00-05:00,"MIT Early Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2028 are now available in the application portal. To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking “View Update.” There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update. 

This year, 12,563 students applied early to the MIT Class of 2028, and as of *checks watch* right now, we have offered early admission to 661. Though they are all different in their own way —  foodies and farmhands, raconteurs and Riemannians, gymnasts and geographers — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with MIT’s mission to use science, technology, and the useful arts to make the world a better place. We can’t wait to welcome them to campus to join the 4,576 outstanding undergraduates already enrolled at MIT. 

We 
        deferred 8,052 applicants;
      
 these students will be reconsidered without prejudice in Regular Action, with decisions released sometime in March. If you are deferred, you are not expected to send us any new information besides the February Updates and Notes (FUN) Form, which will be posted in mid-January to your application portal. We have posted more information for deferred students here; you can also read posts from bloggers who were deferred here, here, here, here, here, here, and most recently here. 

Given the competitiveness of our pool, we have also informed 3,251 students that we will not be able to offer them admission this year. This decision has been made with care, and it is final. I know this can be a difficult decision to receive, but trust me: it works out okay in the end. Take a deep breath, shake it off, and go crush the rest of your college applications (or whatever else you choose to do) this year.

The balance of our applicants —  599 —  withdrew from our process before we issued their decision.  

We recognize it’s a lot of effort for all of you to apply to MIT. It’s an honor and a privilege for us to read your applications. Thank you for sharing your story with us. 

Again, congratulations to the newest members of the Class of 2028. I’ll be closing comments on this post to focus the conversations on the open threads for admitted, deferred, and not admitted students.

All best, everyone; wishing you a healthy and happy end of 2023, and bright beginnings to 2024.",,0

Waiting…,Jessica Z. '27,4,2023-12-15T00:00:00-05:00,"A few days ago, I scrolled through my camera roll to find an old picture. Instead, I found a nearly one year old video that I accidentally recorded when I was talking to my parents about college decisions. To spare myself the embarrassment, I won’t be posting that here, but it reminded me about some of the things I did to avoid thinking about decisions. Hopefully some of these help take your mind off of college, even if just for a few minutes :)

1.) Take Online Quizzes

My friends have long ridiculed me for taking pointless online quizzes, but I love taking them. I don’t hold any of these quizzes to have any merit or influence in my life, but I think they’re a fun way to take your mind off of something. Here are the
        most recent two quizzes I took:
      


- 16 Personalities: A classic quiz! It’s slightly longer than most, and some of the questions are pretty repetitive so it kinda feels like you’re answering the same questions over and over again, BUT, I feel like it’s a pretty fun quiz. I’m an INFJ-T, which stands for
        Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging, and Turbulent.
      


- What Flower are You: My friend sent me this quiz to make a friendship garden collage! The quiz was made by The Linnaean Gardens of Uppsala, a botanical garden in Sweden. It’s very short—just six multiple choice questions—and gives you a flower based on your answers.

2.) Find Fun Google Chrome Extensions

I have a ~lot~ of Google Chrome extensions, but my two current favorites are:

- Coffeelings: Ever since college started, I haven’t been able to keep up with bullet journaling as much as I’ve wanted, and I’ve slowly transitioned from writing in my planner to Google calendar-ing. Coffeelings is a mini journal that takes about ~5-10 minutes of your day, and I like that the mood tracker shows you a broad overview of how your mood has been over the entire year. Would highly recommend!!

- Tabby Cat: Kano introduced me to Tabby Cat at the blogger retreat, and I immediately downloaded it. It generates a cat doodle with a random name each time you open a tab. It’s very cute and makes opening a new website tab for homework so much more enjoyable :^)

3.) Buy/Make Holiday Presents

Practical suggestion! I like making any sort of holiday gift package for people, and it’s even more fun with friends. A few days ago, my friends and I baked and decorated
        250
      
cookies to give to our friends before everyone left for the holidays.

4.) Write Thank-You Cards

Every time I finished writing a college essay last year or received an admissions decision, no matter the outcome, I wrote a thank-you card for someone in my life. It honestly made me feel a lot better during such a stressful time, and it was also just a really good way to remember the people who have helped me in my life. I think now, in college, it recently struck me how differently I interact with people simply because there’s so many more people around. You’d be surprised by how many people keep handwritten thank-you cards, too—I remember visiting my middle school teacher a few years ago, and he kept a thank-you card I wrote when I transferred schools. I love stationary so I like decorating my own cards, but even a simple scrawled note is a gesture that shows you appreciate someone in your life :’)

5.) Be a Tourist in Your Own Home

I’m originally from Jim Thorpe, a small tourist town in Pennsylvania. I
        never really expected to get homesick at all,
      
but when Thanksgiving and December rolled around, I really, really, really wanted nothing more than to just go home. One thing I wish I did more before leaving for college was just being a tourist in my own town and taking the time to appreciate it—I miss my town’s annual Winter celebration, the friendly chatter of neighbors I’ve known since childhood, the festive holiday stores that line the streets, and seeing my family and friends.

6.) Take a Deep Breath 

In a few days, it will mark one year since I was hunched over my laptop screen, refreshing the MIT Admissions portal and rereading MIT’s email about when results would release for the twentieth time. I remember the feeling of nervousness throughout the entire day, and it felt like I was constantly holding my breath. These nerves really didn’t disappear until I talked about it with one of my high school teachers.

She asked me a simple question: What would the decision take away from me? And it was that short question that helped me realize it wouldn’t take anything away. I would still want to study biology, and I would still want to do research. These motivations were, and are, entirely my own. When she told me this, I finally felt some of the stress leave.

I never really stopped to think about my life as a whole until I was forced to write about my life for college essays. Writing about your strengths, weaknesses, and challenges with unbridled authenticity is something valuable, and that is something to be proud of. Your commitment to your community or values aren’t any less important or representative of yourself—they’re wholeheartedly yours, and that is something that any college decision can’t give or take away from you.

I hope these words bring some comfort in the midst of waiting for decisions, and remember to enjoy your senior year of high school. Take some time to thank the people who have helped you and take a deep breath. Congratulations on taking the leap to submit your college applications, and good luck!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-10-at-1.08.58-AM-800x405.png

the mortifying ordeal of being known,Audrey C. '24,11,2023-12-14T00:00:00-05:00,"I’ve mentioned a few times in the past about being unsure as to whether I should pursue a PhD program right after graduation or work in the industry for a bit first. My intention has been to work in the industry first… up until two weeks ago! After talking with my current research supervisor, past mentors, and other people whose advice I value, I decided to throw together a sort of last minute grad app to one of MIT’s 
        PhD
      
 programs.  Well, I don’t really have to make a decision until if I get in, but choosing to apply is to make that decision a possibility. 

It’s kind of crazy how four years ago on this exact day, I was deferred from MIT’s early action round. And today, I’m 
        finishing up
      
 my PhD application for the chance to stay at MIT forever for at least five more years. 

It’s a full circle moment in many ways. For one, I’m once again sitting in front of my computer trying to condense my past four years into a series of textboxes, rec letters, and the Statement of Purpose. The SoP is kind of like the Common App essay, but more focused on how your past academic experiences shape the research questions you’ll investigate in grad school. Once again, I’m scrutinizing every other phrase in my SoP and wondering how my voice, stories, and dreams are going to be perceived by the committee of 
        faculty readers.
      


If you’re anticipating a decision from MIT this Saturday, maybe you’re choosing to go in no thoughts head empty. Honestly this is the move. Or maybe you are more like what I was like four years ago, completely stressed out by the mortifying ordeal of being known. Being vulnerable to a bunch of strangers whose perceptions have some bearing on my future felt mortifying to me back then, and to be completely honest, still ruffles my feathers a bit today. 

But while I haven’t completely eliminated my fear of vulnerability, sometime between four years ago and today I’ve learned to live with it. The full quote from Tim Kreider reads, “if we want the rewards of being loved, we have to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known.” I’ve learned that digging deep within yourself and putting forth what you’ve found is a beautiful, bold act of vulnerability. It takes courage to apply with the hope that the odds will be in your favor. You’ve already taken the incredible leap of submitting an application, and Ceri and Paolo have written better than I can about how proud you should be of yourselves for doing just that. 

On the flip side, being perceived comes with the chance of things not turning out the way you want it to. I personally took my deferral badly and then proceeded to feel bad about having cared so much. I eventually found solace by accepting 
        “it is what it is.”
      
 While that certainly can be a valid way to make peace with yourself, I’ve come to realize through many more rejections — for opportunities within MIT, internship applications, research paper submissions — that caring so much was what drove me to do the thing in the first place. No single decision could ever take away all the ways I’ve grown from those experiences. Should they be unfavorable, nor can Saturday’s decision take away all the things you’ve accomplished, whether that be something cool you learned in class, a project that you’re proud of, or a realization of how you want to better the world. At the same time, you are allowed to feel the things you may feel. You contain multitudes. 

I remember writing about how much I cared about my community back in high school, and how I hope to extend that love to the communities I’ll join in college. Lo and behold, I am once again writing about caring about my communities in college, and how that is informing the research I want to pursue. Sure, MIT might have given me the resources to show my care in certain ways. However, it did not take going to MIT to care in the first place. And I’m certain that care also already exists within you in vast quantities (did I mention that you contain multitudes?), driving you to do incredible things regardless of what happens. For now, continue to extend that care to your loved ones, as they may no longer be within an arms reach in a year.  

I hope that my words can be of some help, even if it’s taking stress levels down just a tiny notch. I personally try to touch grass when I’m stressed. Grass is so green and tickly in a good way. If the activation energy to touch grass seems insurmountable, I watch cat videos, especially the green screen cat trend (see: black cat zoning out, driving cat, crunchy cat, and huh cat). I also like watching and rewatching OK Go’s This Too Shall Pass, which seems especially fitting.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/qybUFnY7Y8w,1
Watch the “Wild” 2023 Final Presentations for 2.009: Product Engineering Processes,Chris Peterson SM '13,3,2023-12-13T00:00:00-05:00,"2.009: Product Engineering Processes is a capstone course in Course 2 (Mechanical Engineering) and one of the most famous courses at MIT. For my fellow FIRST alumni out there, it’s sort of like FRC, but for products. Check out the “build challenge,” which is used as a big collaboration activity early in the term and you’ll see what I mean.

From the website:

2.009, Product Design Processes, is intended to provide students with a team-based product development experience. Students will design and build working alpha prototypes of new products, learning about creativity, product design, teamwork, and working within a budget in a unifying engineering experience. The class is intended to emulate what engineers might experience in a design team at a modern product development firm. As part of a corporate innovation strategy, students will create product opportunities inspired by a very broad product theme.

This year’s theme was Wild! and the introductory animation was….truly wild.

The final project presentations are held annually in before a live audience of ~1300 designers, investors, faculty, and friends who won tickets via a lottery and pack into Kresge, MIT’s largest auditorium, with overflow rooms and a live webcast, and covered by MIT News, the Boston Globe, and other media outlets. The top teams often spin out into companies; back in 2012, blogger Chris M. led the winning Pink Team and took a leave from MIT to become the founding CEO of HelmetHub, which he blogged about here.

Here is a playlist of products that spun out of 2.009 and into the market. I remember watching Animo, below, in person with my jaw dropping to the floor.

I went with five colleagues from admissions and asked a question of the Green Team. 

You can evaluate whether it was a good question by the look of surprise and horror on the face of my admissions officer colleague Julianne in the lower left there, which in an act of cyberbullying I made into an office emoji.

You can watch the entire 3 hour event here, or browse all of the videos —  including the animations and tributes to students and staff — individually here. I’ve embedded the six team presentations below. If you don’t have time to watch them, you can read a PDF “pitch deck” for each product here.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-13-at-10.53.45-AM-e1702482874198-800x169.png

Blogger Wrapped 2023,Kayode D. '27,11,2023-12-10T00:00:00-05:00,"IT’S BLOGGER WRAPPED TIME

This feels almost poetic to me. The very first time I even considered applying to MIT was in January of 2022, when I received a January MIT Newsletter and saw a summary of Ankita D. ‘23’s 2021 Blogger Wrapped post that said Indie Pop was the top Genre among MIT Bloggers. I showed my brother and he said “Well now you have to go there, Kayode, that’s all you listen to.” And he’s not wrong. 

 

Now it’s my turn to inspire you with our random music tastes. 



(Ankita, I’m sorry I’m using your post from last year as a direct guide for this year’s. You just did it so well, I didn’t see any reason to improve it. Everyone go read her blog to show appreciation for the good work she did that I am copying)

Past Blogger Wrapped, for the nerds that may want to read them: 

Ankita 2022

Ankita 2021

Nisha 2020

Nisha 2019

Abby 2018

In 2021, my top song was The Monster Mash, and I listened to it 186 times. I think that’s credential enough to prove I have good music taste and am totally qualified to make this post. 

 

Here’s some stats for nerds: 



Ceri had an astonishing 204 minutes this year (that’s .1 days nonstop). Wow! Gloria really put us to shame this year.




Ceri: “i only used [spotify] when i went for a few outdoor runs this year in March and then life happened and i didn’t exercise in that way anymore so! i am simply not an active-music-listening kind of guy” This explains the lack of…anything…in her spotify wrapped. The rest of us listened to more, i guess.



Gloria and Teresa carried in number of songs this year. Good on them. 



Ceri listened to “Here Comes a Thought” from Steven Universe a WHOPPING 3 times this year! I just want to say that Teresa listened to “Space Cowboy” by flipturn 230 times. That’s a 4 minute song, which adds up to over 15 hours. Now that I’m saying it out loud it isn’t that crazy but still, I get sick of a song after like a week of listening to it. 



There was an interesting variety in the genres listed by bloggers. Andi listened to predominantly Classical and Orchestral Pieces, Fatima had a ton of variations of Eurasian Pop, and once again, indie (or rather, “pov:indie”) was the top genre among bloggers. 

Most of my playlists are just 3 playlists in a trenchcoat, and that probably bumped up the numbers on this one. Good job Andi, you explorer you. 

Top Genres of Bloggers (be inspired): 



Spotify also featured a new feature this year: The Sound City. This is a town that your listening habits best match. My sound city was Burlington VM, which makes sense because I’ve listened to a lot of the “Sad Girl Starter Pack” playlist made by spotify when I study. [I promise, it’s the perfect study music– fun to listen to but mellow enough that you can tune it out and focus on work.] Here’s a map that I (lazily) made of our sound cities:

Very Official Map of Blogger Sound Cities:

 

 

Here’s some stats on top artists. I’m pretty proud of being top .5% for The Beths, but as my friend put it, “I got a late start this year. I should get my numbers up next season.”

Andi Q.  – top .001% of Freshlyground 

Gloria Z.- top .05% of The Strokes 

Teresa J. – top .05% of flipturn 

Paige B. – top .05% of The Cast of Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies

Audrey C. – top .05% of PVRIS 

Jebby – top 0.1% of BrockHapton 

Allison E. -top .1% of salem ilese

Fatima N. – top .1% of Taylor Swift 

Mel N. – top .5% of Carly Rae Jepsen 

Kanokwan T. – top .5% of Laufey 

Kayode D. – top .5% of The Beths

Petey – top 1% of Gareth Coker

Alan Z. – top 2% of Taylor Swift 

Jessica Z. – top 3% of Taylor Swift

Ceri – top 9% of Sara Barelles 

 

I wondered what it took to be in the top .001% for a big artist like Taylor Swift, and apparently a woman listened to 351,281 of Taylor Swift this year, placing her in the top .001%. You need at least 150,000 minutes to get to this level. Good for her, I guess. 









 

There you have it! Enjoy the data and the end of the year! We also made a playlist that everyone contributed a few of their top songs to, so give it a listen!

grad school vs. undergrad,Rona W. '23,0,2023-12-09T00:00:00-05:00,"This past September, I started my master’s of engineering. At MIT, the computer science MEng is often seen as an extension of undergrad, but I wanted to compare the two experiences, with the caveat that I’m early in my grad school journey.

There are a few major differences between grad school and undergrad.

I live in an apartment now. Grad housing was a nightmare—the day the portal opened, the website crashed almost immediately and almost every option disappeared. So I don’t live in a grad dorm.

Instead, I live in an apartment with a roommate who works full-time at a Real Job. This is a drastic social shift from my time in undergrad, where I was in an independent living group (sort of like a sorority or fraternity house, but not Greek affiliated). I’m so lucky that my current roommate is a close friend with amazing taste in decor and books, and I’m really happy here. There is simply a big difference between living with one person and living with thirty. Plus, being in an actual apartment means adulting tasks like purchasing my own furniture, paying utilities bills, etc.

I’m only taking one class. At MIT, MEngs are capped at twenty-four units a semester, which usually means two courses. In comparison, undergraduates usually take four or five classes. Taking only one class works very well for me—I like focusing on fewer things at any given time, and in undergrad, I found it difficult to context-switch between so many obligations.

I’m a teaching assistant. To get funding, most MEngs have to TA or RA (research assistant), although some self-fund and some have an outside fellowship. In particular, we have the 6-A program, which allows you to intern at a company in exchange for that company funding your degree.

I TA an introductory computer science course. TA obligations vary from class to class, but mine include hosting office hours, leading recitation, writing exams, attending staff meeting, etc. It takes up about twenty hours each week.

I get funding. Many master’s programs are not free, so sometimes there is a misconception about how the MEng funding works, but as stated above, most MEngs are funded. This funding pays for tuition, health insurance, and a stipend (which, in the 2023-2024 school year, is about $4000/month before taxes—the exact numbers are available online). This makes it more financially feasible for students to pursue the degree.

Social life is different. This is also a symptom of growing up, not just being in a master’s program. As many other twentysomethings can probably attest to, adult socializing is much less spontaneous. Since I don’t live in a dorm, I can’t randomly hit up someone on my floor to go get boba. Plus, many of my closest friends from MIT don’t live in Boston/Cambridge anymore, as they’re in graduate school or working elsewhere.

Do I miss the proximity of undergrad? Of course. But I also think being older has provided clarity for my relationships. Like, who do I actually still keep in touch with? If I no longer have the shared context of MIT with somebody, do we still have anything in common? Everything feels more grounded, less capricious.

Sometimes, younger students ask me if they should pursue the MEng, and my answer is: it depends.

In my year (class of 2023), many students decided to MEng instead of directly going into industry because the tech job market was difficult and they struggled to land a job. Totally understandable. I also know people who decided to MEng because they felt that their undergraduate experience was cut short by COVID-19, and this was a good way to stay on campus an extra year.

I also often hear the sentiment that the MEng is a great way to pursue research if you’re unsure about a PhD, or if you want more experience before applying to a PhD. Note this might not hold true at other schools. As far as I know, while the MIT MEng is comparable to programs at Stanford/Harvard that also allow undergraduate students to receive master’s degrees in computer science, the MEng requires everyone to write a thesis, which usually means working in a lab and gaining real research experience.

For me, I always intended to MEng, because I added computer science as my second major pretty late. (Math was my first major.) To graduate in a timely manner, I had to take four computer science classes every semester for three semesters straight, and I mostly only had space to take required courses, although I did get some flexibility among computer science electives.

I wanted the opportunity to learn more computer science, especially within my specific interests. In particular, I wanted to take Performance Engineering, a notoriously time-intensive course that I wasn’t eligible for, due to pre-reqs, until this fall.

A common critique of the MEng program is that it allows students to “hide out” for an extra year, delaying adult life. I think this is a personal decision that requires self-reflection. Some of my friends have said they didn’t MEng because they knew they would be doing so to avoid adult responsibilities, and that’s totally fair. It isn’t for everyone.

In terms of career prospects, there are certain positions, such as ML Engineer, that are usually not available to people who only hold a bachelor’s degree. However, my personal belief is that simply having a master’s degree on your resume won’t significantly improve your chances of landing these jobs—you’re competing against PhDs, and not all master’s degrees are equal. It’s important to have research or industry experience on top of an advanced degree if you’re targeting a specific role like that.

When I was interning at Microsoft, I asked one of the more senior employees if I should pursue an MEng. He said, “Well, if you started right after undergrad, you would be at a junior rank, and if you took another year for a master’s degree, you would start at one rank higher, but if you had spent that year working at this company, you would’ve gotten promoted to that rank anyway, so it doesn’t make a difference in terms of your position. And you also lost a year’s worth of salary.” He also acknowledged that there are reasons beyond title and compensation to pursue a master’s degree, but the point here was that it wouldn’t help me materially as a software engineer, at least at Microsoft. (Also please note that Microsoft is a huge company and this is simply what one employee said, so it may differ depending on the exact team and role.)

Personally, I’m really happy with my decision to do this. I’ve enjoyed learning more computer science, teaching undergrads, spending another year on campus. It doesn’t feel like an extension of undergrad, but another chapter of my life.

my shattered laptop,Kanokwan T. '26,4,2023-12-07T00:00:00-05:00,"Yesterday, what was an unfortunate event turned into something kinda funny…

During lecture for MAS.863 How To Make (Almost) Anything at the Media Lab, a classmate accidentally shattered my laptop screen.

During lecture for MAS.863 How To Make (Almost) Anything at the Media Lab, a classmate accidentally shattered my laptop screen.

While I was with my group presenting our project, I left my coat on a chair, backpack to the side, and laptop on the ground. I didn’t expect anyone to sit there. When I returned, I was surprised to see someone in my seat. I pointed out my items and asked if I could have my seat back, and he responded with “I have some bad news for you…” to which I felt some concern. In the process of him sitting in my chair, the seat flipped down and crushed my laptop. He showed me my computer, apologized very sincerely for breaking it, and offered helping in any way he could. I was baffled by the audacity to sit in a seat that’s clearly someone else’s, but could sympathize a bit since he came in late and was just scrambling for somewhere to settle. I also understood that he didn’t do it maliciously, rather, it was just an unfortunate accident. Still really sucked, though.

i quickly drew this scene up so you can get a sense of what it was like

I examined the damage and had a hunch that only my display was broken. I wasn’t sure if that was the case and needed it fixed ASAP, so I left class during our break (we have a 15 minute break halfway through our long 3-hour lecture) to test out my hunch on an office external display. Before I left, I contacted a few different student channels asking if anyone had a portable monitor I could borrow for awhile:

- im-having-a-personal-problem@mit.edu, which is a mailing list that contacts primarily East Campus (my previous dorm) residents about niche issues

- #simmons-bartering-system in the Simmons (my current dorm) Discord, which is a channel used for trading goods

- #help in the The Chaos Table Discord, which is a channel my friend group uses to send calls for help

My message:



Then, I biked over to MIT Admissions and Jeremy kindly let me use his office, which had a monitor.



During this short bike ride, a toooon of people responded. Like, 16 people reached out for all sorts of reasons—to express concern, offer a monitor, and share ideas for solutions. It was really heartwarming. The issue was resolved within the hour. Here’s the recap email I sent out:

fun fact: Both Petey and Audrey told me to post this email as a blog!

Below is the aforementioned timeline and the remainder of the email (which I’ve pasted below so you can see the photos and video better):

- 2:10pm: laptop gets accidentally destroyed by a classmate



out of curiosity, i just walked to Metropolis (my primary maker space) and used the calipers to measure the buckle of my display. the max displacement is 7.72 mm!

it was actually kind of… beautiful? here is a video of me playing with it:

- 2:16pm: i reached out to people via email and Discord asking for a monitor

- 2:21pm: first email rolls in

- 2:24pm: i text the person who emailed

- 2:57pm: the person roller skates over with the monitor

- 3-4pm: i set up the monitor with my laptop and deal with horrible, horrible tech issues but miraculously worked through it just in-time for a remote interview



- 4-5pm: interview

- 5-6pm: blogger hangout meeting (which we dub blogaholics anonymous)

- now: i am sending this email!

the end

In addition to the swift move of the selfless roller skater, I was also fortunate that this laptop was not my own, rather, it was one I was loaning from MIT. I contacted IS&T (Information Systems & Technology), the organization that runs the university laptop loaner program, and asked if I could get a replacement. One has been shipped to my dorm and should arrive tonight or tomorrow.

I just got out of 2.001 Mechanics and Materials recitation and showed the professor my laptop because I thought this would make an excellent problem in the class! Like, one of my first thoughts when I saw my bent laptop was “wow, the display yielded (when a solid permanently changes shape) before the body!” Questions I thought of:

- What’s the maximum force that could’ve been applied before it yielded?

- How does the location of the applied force mathematically relate to the yield point?

- What variables change if a point load was applied instead of a distributed load?

- How does the displacement between the display and the solid body change?

- How would you measure the buckle of the display?

In essence, how can you model the deformation of the material? Anyways. That’s my little mechanical engineering major nerd moment.

All is resolved now. In the end, this experience gave me back some hope in humanity as a whole. I feel supported here. I’m honestly not surprised that people reached out so fast—knowing the community here, it only made sense. Despite all the chaos coursing through campus, people are so willing to help other people.

Thanks for tuning into this unfortunate, but funny and ultimately heartwarming episode.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_0812-1000x660.jpg

GUYS IT SNOWED!!,Allison E. '27,4,2023-12-07T00:00:00-05:00,"AHHHHHH!!!!

I love snow!! I’ve been checking my weather app slightly for the last month or so, and every once and a while a [four days from now: 30% chance of <0.05 in. of snow for 20 minutes] has popped up. A spark of hope!! Then, I’d check the weather again an hour later, and it’d be gone. And I would be sad. Rinse, repeat.

About a week ago, that “30% chance of <0.05 in. of snow” popped up a couple times for yesterday (Wednesday, 12/6), but in the last fiveish days leading up to Wednesday it switched to just cloudy. I gave up hope. I resigned myself to an incredibly banal Wednesday—except extra sad because I’d have to wake up at 8:00 am for PE class registration :(

And so… Tuesday night, my roommates and I put the combined might of our six alarms together to make sure that we all woke up. And then we proceeded to stay awake until 4 am, because “hey, can just go back to sleep after registration anyways, yeah?”

7:50 am. The alarms ring. We get out of bed. We pull out our laptops and refresh the registration site over and over until 8:00 am hits. It’s the 
        third time
      
 we’ve done this, so we’re just on autopilot. And then the site loads! And for the first time, I don’t screw up registration, and I get a class I wanted—beginner ice skating!! (btw, MIT has some pretty cool PE classes that you should check out!)

AND 
        THEN.
      


One of my roommates looked out the window. And IT WAS SNOWING.

I shall repeat my opening line: AHHHHHHH!!!! 
        Sleep was no longer an option.
      
 I changed out of pajamas as quickly as I could, terrified that it would stop before I could get outside. Pants, shirt, sweater, jacket. Should I brush my teeth? Should I put on actual snow boots? Nah, no time. I ran down the stairs and out the door and IT WAS SNOWING!!!!

I think the PE registration adrenaline decided to combine with my first-snow adrenaline to turn me into an out-of-control gremlin making actual out-loud excited gremlin noises. Some of my friends were also yelling excitedly (albeit in our group chat), and so we met up in the massive field across from dorm row to frolic!

And ok, it’s not a lot of snow (as my parents so kindly informed me after I sent them pictures ), but photos can’t capture the amazingness of snow actually falling from the sky. Plus!! There was enough snow vaguely sprinkled around to still have fun. We stole snow off cars to make snowballs, drew things in the barely-covered grass, ran around in circles, and even made some snow angels!

before you say anything—don’t hurt my snow angel’s feelings >:(

After fooling around outside for a while we headed to Next’s dining hall to grab breakfast, and by the time we’d finished eating, the snow had stopped, and everything on the ground had mostly melted. It was a little disappointing, but we didn’t really expect it to last. 

In fact, I’m really just amazed that we were all awake to witness the snow at all. Without PE registration, there’s no way in heck we’d have all been awake at 8:00 am. It was the most excellent timing, and despite my two previous failures, I can now say that I officially a PE registration supporter(?). Anyways, yay snow!!!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20231206_081204_Original-800x1000.jpeg

SIMMONS GOT A TRAMPOLINE!!!,Kayode D. '27,3,2023-12-06T00:00:00-05:00,"There’s a trampoline in Simmons!!!!

Trampoline!!!! and also the ping pong table that is now less cool in comparison

I live in Simmons Hall. For the last few weeks, large boxes have been sitting in the lobby, and 2 days ago they were finally unpacked. Inside was a TRAMPOLINE!!1!

I love trampolines. I can’t do flips or anything particularly cool on one, except jump really high. My family used to have one in our backyard in Indiana that we got from our neighbors and I adored it so…until it started rubbing off and making my feet black. There’s this video my parents will randomly send me of little me and my cousins on our trampoline (which was only supposed to have like 2 kids at a time but we put around 8). My dad tells all of us to take a turn doing something cool for the camera, but on my turn I just rolled around and flopped on the floor. Not one of my best moments. 

 

The Simmons trampoline is a great example of MIT Government in action. Every dorm has its own dorm government system, with a House President and Chair, as well as chairs for everything you could imagine. Simmons has a Woodshop Chair, a Crafts Chair, a Gym Chair, a Frosh and Events chair, and even a slushy chair (the result of a proposal, discussed below).

Even if you are not part of house government, you can still attend the house meeting every other Sunday, where we discuss changes and events at Simmons, as well as allow anyone the chance to propose a way to spend Simmons funds. Sometimes it’s for things like supplies for the crafts room, or a new piece of gym equipment, or a $1500 massage chair (that didn’t pass). Someone suggested getting a Simmons trampoline, and it passed in the house meeting. And now it’s in the lobby! It really is that easy. 

I made a proposal at the last house meeting to buy a drum set for the MPR [multipurpose room] where we have house meetings and watch movies some time. There’s already a grand piano in there, so a drum set would be a great addition. I also brought a janky portable drum set a few weeks ago to practice for 
        Cru Boston
      
, and I heard from many people that they liked having a drumset in there. My proposal was positively met, but I failed to consider the cost of drumsticks, a drum rug, or cymbals, which are apparently not included with the set and are MAD expensive.

I also need to confirm that getting a drumset is OK with the house manager. Apparently, a few years ago a proposal was passed to get an ice cream machine for Simmons, but the plumbing to install it would be a nightmare, so there’s an unused ice cream machine in the Simmons basement somewhere. I have yet to confirm that the drumset is OK with the manager, so that proposal will not be shown tonight. 

House government positions last for one calendar year and are re-elected every December. 
        Tonight
      
 is the re-election night, and me and my friend, Noah R. ‘27 were nominated to run for Social Chairs. As social chairs, we will be responsible for the Simmons Lounges and hosting social events at Simmons. 

The Lounge system is where Simmons residents (often called Simms) can create a group and receive funding to do whatever they want with. 

My group’s lounge is called “Alpha Σimmons Σimmons.”

 

So yeah!! 

 

 

When the trampoline was first put up, one of the upperclassmen said “I have friends who refuse to think that MIT is a real college, and it’s just a big science summer camp,” and while this certainly isn’t always true, it’s pretty close. 

Y’all, I have a group project due tonight that I will not have finished in time. I should not be writing this. You’re welcome.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Trampoline-400x301.jpg

Curseroad,Andi Q. '25,5,2023-12-06T00:00:00-05:00,"Choosing classes at MIT is like filling up a skill tree in a video game. Each class taken unlocks branches of other exciting classes, and there are always tons of great options to choose from. But sometimes, there are too many great options; with over 300 classes in 
        Course 6
      
 alone, it can be a bit overwhelming trying to construct a roadmap of interesting and highly-rated classes while still hitting all the requirements.

That’s why we have CourseRoad – a website for planning what classes to take at MIT! CourseRoad is an invaluable tool for MIT students – it has information about the requirements for each major, when classes are offered, and even the average number of hours for each class (based on course evaluations).

It’s also a really fun video game! … kind of. While it’s not explicitly designed as such, I like to use CourseRoad as a quasi-MIT simulator where I test the limits of how one can graduate from MIT. Perfect for answering questions like:

- Is it possible to graduate without ever writing a final exam? (Yes)

- Is it possible to have a 
        48-unit schedule
      
 that averages over 100 hours per week? (Yes – by taking 
        2.009
      
, 
        4.153
      
, and 
        6.2220
      
 together)

- Will I graduate? (Yes… hopefully)

Most of the resulting roadmaps are rather… questionable, to say the least. Many of them probably wouldn’t work in real life. But nevertheless, it’s amazing to see all the different ways you could theoretically graduate from MIT.


        Theoretically.
      


The rules of the game

CourseRoad doesn’t really impose any restrictions on your planned roadmap. Want to schedule 200 classes in your sophomore fall so you can graduate in three semesters with every major? Sure thing – CourseRoad has no objections to that.

So, to keep it somewhat realistic (and more challenging), here are some rules I try to impose on myself when creating cursed roadmaps:

- Only include advanced standing exams (ASEs) when absolutely necessary. ASEs are basically a way to test out of some classes like general institute requirements (GIRs). Most people don’t learn college-level differential equations or quantum mechanics in high school, so I try not to include any ASEs if possible. (But when I do include them, I include all of them.)

- Cap the number of units per semester at 54. Most classes at MIT are 12 units, so this cap corresponds to four and a half classes per semester, which is (usually) a reasonable workload.

- Satisfy all prerequisites for each taken class. To keep the progression of classes more realistic.

Other than these few restrictions, everything else is fair game. I count majors as “complete” when CourseRoad marks them as such; although this is an oversimplification (because of rules around double counting classes and such), it’s good enough for my purposes.

Without further ado, here are five cursed roadmaps I’ve created this year.

Course 6n’t

For better or worse, my own MIT degree audit is the inspiration behind this first roadmap. The 
        old
      
 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) major is known for being super flexible because of the breadth of disciplines that EECS encompasses. For example, you could major in 6-2 and graduate without taking any circuits-related classes.

But just how flexible is it? What’s the minimum number of 
        Course 6
      
 classes you’d need to take to major in 6-2 and get an MEng?

According to CourseRoad, 
        six
      
 (out of 35 total classes)!

(The Course 6 classes are highlighted in bold.)

Wait, how is this even possible? And what’s with all the biology/math classes? A few things are going on that make this roadmap possible:

- I exploit the fact that some math classes like 
        18.03
      
, 
        18.06
      
 (both from 
        Course 18
      
) count toward majors across multiple departments. After all, most things in engineering are just mathematics under the hood.

- Also, the way I counted classes is a bit misleading. Most of the remaining classes I’ve included are “joint subjects” between departments, where a single class is offered under two different numbers. So something like Micro/Nano Processing Technology would be both 3.155 in 
        Course 3
      
 and 6.2600 in 
        Course 6
      
.

To be clear, I don’t think this degree of flexibility is necessarily bad, even if it can lead to questionable roadmaps like this one. If anything, it shows just how applicable EECS is to everything.

I am speed

How long does it take to graduate from MIT? Usually, people take four years; some manage to do it in three. CourseRoad says it’s doable in a year and a half if you major in 8-FLEX (Physics, Flexible Track):

I had to go to pretty extreme lengths to make this roadmap possible:

- I included all thirteen available ASEs because the list included three required classes (
        18.03
      
, 
        8.03
      
, and 
        8.04
      
).

- I double counted a lot of requirements. 8-FLEX requires a three-subject concentration that I satisfied using music technology classes, which also count toward the general institute requirements (GIRs).

- Not all classes in this roadmap are offered regularly. For example, 
        STS.042
      
 is only offered once every two years.

But despite (or rather, because of) these aggressive optimizations, following this roadmap won’t actually allow you to graduate in a year and a half. Although CourseRoad is pretty thorough, it leaves out a few important details of MIT’s graduation requirements:

- You need at least 180 units beyond GIRs to graduate, but this roadmap only has 108 units beyond GIRs. (It’s hard to accrue so many units from only three semesters at MIT… although I suppose you could theoretically use humanities/arts/social sciences (HASS) transfer credit to compensate for that.)

- You can only count three HASS subjects from your primary major toward the GIRs, but this roadmap uses four.

Nevertheless, I was surprised that I could cram so much stuff into just three semesters.

18-wheeler truck

At MIT, most classes count for 12 units of academic credit, with each unit corresponding roughly to one hour of work per week. A few classes count for 18 (or more) units, but those are usually advanced elective subjects that demand well over 18 hours of work per week.

Because of the intimidating nature of such classes, 
        Course 8
      
 and 
        Course 4
      
 are rather infamous for not only offering but requiring 18- and 24-unit classes for their majors respectively. Course 8 has 
        8.13 and 8.14
      
, while Course 4 has 
        4.023, 4.024, and 4.025
      
, with 4.025 averaging 43.5 hours per week. (Although I must say that these classes sound much scarier than they actually are – all the Course 4s I’ve spoken to seem to enjoy the Architecture Design Studio classes.)

With that, here’s a roadmap of a double major in 8 (Physics, Focused Track) and 4 (Architecture) that takes all five of those classes!

(The 18+ unit classes are highlighted in bold.)

This roadmap was one of the most challenging to make because of the credit limit I imposed on myself. It’s probably one of the most painful to follow in real life too – just look at the average number of hours per week in senior fall! But unlike the previous roadmap, this one will actually work in real life. Although there are definitely less painful ways to double major in 8 and 4.

(When I was making this roadmap, I also discovered a 42-unit IAP class about supply chain management! I’m still not quite sure how that class even exists though, since the credit limit over IAP is 12 units.)

69420

With numbers being front and center in MIT academics, students joke about wanting their transcripts/degrees to say “69420” somewhere. Although there’s no class numbered 6.9420 (huge missed opportunity on Course 6’s end), it is possible to major in 6-9 (Computation and Cognition) and minor in 4-B (Design) and 20 (Biological Engineering).

Let’s take that idea a step further – this next roadmap is a triple major in those three fields.

Like the MIT speedrun, I had to include all the ASEs and double count a bunch of biology classes to pull this off. But MIT doesn’t allow triple majoring anymore, so this roadmap wouldn’t work in real life anyway.

Fun fact: It’s also possible to construct a quadruple major roadmap using four biology-related majors, but the proof is left as an exercise to the reader.

Bad chemistry

This last roadmap is arguably the most cursed one of them all – a 5 (Chemistry) major with a 3-C (Archaeology) minor:

So what exactly is cursed about this roadmap? At first glance, it looks like a pretty regular set of classes to take for a chemistry degree.

Well, remember how I said that most classes at MIT count for 12 units? The more general pattern is that the number of units for a class is a multiple of 3, and this holds true for pretty much every class at MIT. But in true chemistry fashion, almost every exception to that rule lies in 
        Course 5
      
.

Take a look at the sophomore spring of this roadmap. Seven classes are scheduled for that semester (already somewhat unusual), but they add up to… 46 units? It’s because 
        5.361
      
, 
        5.362
      
, and 
        5.371
      
 are worth 4, 5, and 4 units respectively. And this weird credit allocation happens 9 more times throughout the rest of the roadmap.

Truly an abomination against nature.

Anyway, I should probably get back to studying for finals and stuff instead of procrastinating on CourseRoad. So see you all next semester!

This is definitely my schedule next semester for real. I’d even have lunch breaks on Monday and Wednesday!",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unknown-19-800x776.png,1
many pink dresses,Amber V. '24,1,2023-12-05T00:00:00-05:00,"There are four pink dresses in my room.

Presentations for MIT’s most well-known MechE capstone, 2.009: Product Design, are coming up this Monday. There are six teams — Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, and Pink — and we’ve each come up with a unique product, and have spent the last several weeks building them in lab. We’re so excited to launch (and to finally sleep after the launch). Tune in to our presentation!!!

I’m one of the presenters for Pink Team, but I own two pink articles of clothing: a crop top originally purchased for Barbie, and a t-shirt given to me by 2.009. So I asked my floor, B1, if anyone had a pink dress I could borrow. I asked my teammates, too. And everyone delivered! In the last two days I’ve been offered four dresses to try on. Just seeing them in my room fills me with warmth and reminds me to cherish the community we have here.

a fun bet,Anika H. '26,7,2023-12-03T00:00:00-05:00,"When I was once a high school senior drowning in college applications, every essay that I wrote left me more and anxious about whether I was going anywhere at all. I wanted to go to college, but how would I possibly represent everything about who I am as a person in 250 words? I couldn’t, so I picked and pruned at what would make me seem most interesting, most full-of-potential, most densely packed with everything that was me, but it never seemed quite enough. By the point I was halfway through trying to woo the places I wanted to go, I convinced myself I would miss most of my shots so that I wouldn’t be too disappointed when it came true.

 

“Shut the f*ck up bro, what are you even talking about?” my sister said to that.

MIT was my dream. Between the being able to make whatever you want and the absolute freedom of just being able to paint an institute wall, or research , or swing from a giant rope in the trees, I held it with such high regard, I lowered my expectations down to the very bottom.

“I’ll bet you twenty bucks I’m not getting in.”

“I’ll bet you twenty that you are.”

“You know what? I’m so confident I’m gonna get rejected, I’ll bet you my entire wallet and if I win, you’ll still only give me 20 dollars.”

“You’re crazy.”

“Those are the odds I think are against me.”

“How much you got in your wallet?”

“I’m not telling you.” For some reason, I didn’t want her to know how much I had earned from art commissions.

“Is it more than 20?”

“Tens of times more.”

“Oh yes, please, I’m gonna be so rich by the end of this.”

“Dude you’re literally going to lose.”

“You better not forget this bet!” she yelled, trotting back into her own room.

I set up the bet so that if I fell short, I’d get a consolation prize, and if I got in, I’d be so happy I wouldn’t care about my wallet.

 

When the decision day rolled around, I woke up at noon, 14 minutes before the letter would drop (I lived on the west coast), brushed my teeth, and sat back on my bed with Erinn, expecting a full day of writing other application essays.

I saw confetti stream down the center of the page.

“well, I guess you won that bet,” I grinned.

She screamed. Then I screamed. Then we were jumping around and screaming for a solid five minutes. I screamed because I was terrified and overjoyed for the future. My sister screamed because she was genuinely happy for me, and because she just won the rights to my entire wallet.

I called my mom to tell her the news, and she cried and drove all the way back home.

After showing my mom the letter and that this wasn’t just a fever dream, and things started to calm down, Erinn started staring at me intensely. She then wiggled her fingers at me, gesturing for me to hand the money over. Unfortunately, mom knew of the bet, so I passed over the cold pack of leather and watched as she pulled out the bills and counted them one by one. While it hurt just a tinge to see all my hard earned money go, I was too happy to care, and I knew what I just paid my sister dwarfed in comparison to what would be my tuition for the next four years. Needless to say, she became a really rich man that day.

i went broke for a good while after that

Moral of the story: Gambling is good.

Just kidding, for all the protofrosh out there, if you felt the same way I did, you can try this bet with a friend or a loved one. It adds a little fun to the process.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wallet-400x373.jpg,1
‘Til the Net Breaks,Emiko P. '25,3,2023-12-03T00:00:00-05:00,"Hi, everyone! The soccer season has just wrapped up, and I wanted to give y’all a little recap. 

For starters, it’s important to know that the season is basically broken up into three mini seasons:

- Preseason: where we show up two weeks before school starts in order to start training for games.

- Regular season: where we play all of our official games on the calendar.

- Postseason: where we play in our conference tournament and compete for a spot in the 
        NCAA
      
 tournament. 

The regular season was a huge success! In our conference, the 
         NEWMAC
      
, we won 10 games and only lost one. Now, let me walk you through the play-by-play for how our postseason went.

The NEWMAC Tournament

Our first tournament is the conference championship, which is three games over the span of a week. 

In the NEWMAC quarterfinals against Clark, we win 6-0. Two days later is the semifinals, where we snag a solid 6-1 W against Springfield and move onto the championship game.

In the championship, we play the only NEWMAC team we lost to the whole season: Babson. With the first warm day in a while, the sun shining, and a score to settle, it is the perfect day for soccer. We start the game like a crack of lightning, and you can instantly tell what type of game it will be. After a game of bicycle kicks, the most chef’s kiss tiki taka you’ve ever seen, and a lot of screaming and cheering from the bench, we end up winning the game 5-0!

By the end of the game, we are lifting a big silver trophy on our home field and are the official 2023 Conference Champions! We have a saying on our team: “til’ the net breaks,” which refers to how relentless we are to goal, and how the only way we’ll stop scoring goals is if we literally break the net.

Let’s just say, after scoring 17 goals in three games (!!!), that we broke the net this week.

NEWMAC CHAMPS!!!

The NCAA Tournament

The NCAA tournament is a nationwide tournament, with only 64 of the best D3 women’s soccer teams making the cut. The bracket selection is live streamed by the NCAA and is how every team learns that if made the NCAA tournament. Because we won our conference tournament, we get an automatic spot — but for others, whether or not their name will appear on the bracket is a mystery.

The teams that made the tournament are announced one at a time, with a live commentator saying a bit about that teams’ season and showing some of their goal highlights. When our name finally appears on the bracket, we cheer not only because we are in the tournament, but because we are hosting the first round. That means the first two games of the tournament will be played on our home turf. 

Let’s. Go.

Round of 64: only 64 teams in the country left playing.

We play our first team of the tournament: College of Mount Saint Vincent. With a nice 3-1 win, we smoothly advance to the next round. 

Round of 32: only 32 teams in the country left playing.

The very next day is our second game of the tournament. We play University of Southern Maine. Maybe it’s the sore legs from the day before, but we go down a goal in the first 6 minutes of the game and we don’t score for the rest of the half. If we don’t score, our season will end. 

For some reason, however, it never crosses my mind that we won’t pull through and come back — and I am proven right, because in the second half we come out guns blazing and put 4 goals in the back of the net. The bench is erupting with each goal scored, our fan section is cheering, my voice is gone after screaming so much, and one of our freshmen gets so excited after a goal she goes to high five the rest of us and face plants instead. 

We’ve survived the first weekend, and something about how good we’re playing makes me think we can win the whole thing.

SWEET 16 BOUND!!!

Sweet 16: only 16 teams in the country left playing.

One week later, we are back at it. We had driven 7 hours from MIT to Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, where we are playing John Carroll. Everything is on the line this game, and you can feel just how badly every single one of us wants to win. The Elite Eight is just one game away.

Right from the first whistle, we are relentless. We are out of the gates immediately, putting so much pressure on them that they start subbing out their defense in the first 10 minutes. We rip shot after beautiful shot, and they bounce off posts, off the goalie’s fingertips, or just outside the goal.

By half time, it’s still 0-0. There is no question that we are dominating, but we need to score.

Early in the second half, John Carroll scores. It’s a bit disheartening, but I know that we can win. Every single player on our roster is a stud, and what we do best is breaking the net and scoring.

As the clock winds down, it is a bit shocking to see that we still haven’t scored. Even though we had 30 shots on goal, the final whistle blows, and we lose 0-1 to John Carroll. It doesn’t feel real that, just like that, our season is over.

This game was particularly brutal because we knew that we had what it took to win. It just somehow didn’t happen. Later that day, my dad tells me that soccer isn’t always fair. I think he’s right. Sometimes this is just the way sports go.

Regardless of how it ended, it was an amazing game, season, and experience, and not everyone can say they were one of the last 16 teams playing in the U.S. We drove home on the bus, and there were tears and disappointment, sure, but also so much team spirit and love. After singing our hearts out to Olivia Rodrigo and having a runway show where we strutted down the bus aisle, it really hit home that I can always count on our team to have fun and support each other through tough times.

So, that was our 2023 season! We finished ranked #14 in the nation, had an astounding 21 wins, and were Conference Champs. Looking forward to breaking the net next season and bringing you all along with me! 

Roll tech!

Blogger Retreat 2023,Paige B. '24,4,2023-12-02T00:00:00-05:00,"A liveblog on the blogger retreat 2023 (check back in throughout the weekend to see the latest updates!).

Background

Slack Messages



Earlier this year, Kano suggested we have a blogger retreat this semester. We really be in our romanticism era. One month later, with an Airbnb booked, tickets for the commuter rail bought, and our laptops ready for blogging, we begin.

(Also deep thanks to Kano for the planning and brilliant execution of this retreat, we are all very excited!!!)

Liveblogging

Also about a month ago, in the middle of one of our blogger check-ins, Kano asked the question: What is liveblogging? The answer: (according to Wikipedia) a 
        “blog
      
 intended to provide coverage of an ongoing event in rolling text”. Apparently this used to be something that the bloggers used to do more often on MITAdmissions. Essentially, like a giant 
        X
      
 thread, we keep updating the blogpost throughout the day/event.

This idea sounded really cool to me, and when better a time to try liveblogging than on the blogging retreat? So, keep checking into this blogpost every now and then over the rest of the weekend to catch the latest updates!

The Journey Begins

Why the commuter rail?

Well as it turns out, many of us going on the retreat cannot drive, so we figured we’d take on the dark academia aesthetic of a train on a grey-skies-day. Five of us (myself, Kayode, Allison, Jessica, and Kano) grabbed lunch at West Garage and hopped on an Uber over to North Station where we had planned to meet Waly and Gloria.

Fun fact: starting today, the train going to our destination isn’t running due to construction on the line. Instead, there is a shuttle service into the city. Perhaps not as romantic as a train, but the retreat must go on. The five of us hopped on the shuttle to wait for the others to join and …. the shuttle took off lmao. Rip, we will catch up with Waly and Gloria soon enough.

The Two Left Behind

Waly: I walked from MIT to North Station, where the MBTA commuter rail leaves from. Which is about a 59-minute walk according to Google Maps, but 40 minutes at a New York walking pace. I got there before everyone else on accident, so since I had about 30 minutes to burn, I went to a local cafe. I got a matcha latte and a sandwich, but there was no sugar in the matcha latte so that was a bit awkward o__o. I wanted a little unhealthy drink but it felt too healthy now, so I added some sugar packets. I was walking back to the station to meet up with everyone else when I got a message saying the train-turned-bus had unexpectedly ditched me left. So I went to North Station intending to take the next bus with Gloria who also didn’t make it with the first group. However, I proceeded to get lost in North Station because the MBTA had negative signage explaining where the shuttle bus was. Eventually, I found an MBTA worker who told me to go down a sus little corridor to find the shuttle, and I met up with Gloria to take the bus to our destination.

Gloria: I was actually awake since much earlier in the morning, but due to poor time management and lack of executive function, I didn’t start packing until 2:30PM (when everyone else left campus). It doesn’t help that I’m a chronic overpacker, spending a good 30 seconds pondering if I needed to bring extra AA batteries (??), a portable phone charger (the bus ride was like 40 minutes), an HDMI converter, etc. At 3, I Ubered from Maseeh to North Station, got directions to the shuttle loading area, and met up with Waly! Our bus pulled out of the station just as the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting horizontal golden rays across the bus interior. Our surroundings shifted from city streets to worn New England homes to coastline, and then we were in northern Massachusetts.

We’ve Made It

House Meeting

We had like a 30-45 minute meeting talking about our goals for the retreat and the blogs we want to work on. We began with the icebreaker: “Would you rather have feet for hands or hands for feet”, to which all but Waly agreed they would rather have hands for feet. We discussed blogger struggles:tm:, the (abridged) history of the blogs, and things we want to write this weekend.



Shortly after, we ordered pizza for dinner (pepperoni and 
        hawaiian),
      
 and began working on our various self-assigned projects.

Late Night Shenanigans

It’s currently 3am, and 
        half
      
 of the retreat members are up and (mildly) active. We decided to turn on The Golden Bachelor about (checks watch) 6? hours ago? And it is still on. We are down to the final last three women, if that is of interest to you dear reader. Updates from tomorrow to come.

The Morning

The Airbnb had checkout at 11am, which for those of us who were up at 4am was a bit a stretch but we made it lol. Kano, Gloria, and Jessica were chilling/writing/watching TV downstairs while the rest of us were asleep (or half asleep) in various locations around the house. At around 10:30 we nabbed a polaroid and a selfie, and departed to the train station to catch the shuttle back to Boston.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bloggerretreat-1-400x125.png

transitions,"Alan Z. '23, MEng '24",2,2023-12-01T00:00:00-05:00,"This post started as a voice memo, taken during a walk home. Its unpolished, initial form, complete with pauses and rephrasings, is here:

I had a very difficult time my freshman fall. I remember feeling like I was always out of place, like I didn’t belong here, or like I was just in the cosmically wrong place. I didn’t know why I’d chosen to come to MIT, where everybody seemed to just talk about math all the time, and the only thing that made me feel more sure about my choice to come here was that sometimes I would visit my friends at another school, and I’d say, “Well, I really don’t like that, so I guess this is the right place.” Most days, though, I just felt like nothing made sense, except for maybe the classes, and even then only because of a combination of P/NR, taking easier classes, and just an
        incredible stubbornness in getting things done.
      


I remember the first time the world made sense to me was during Thanksgiving break. I helped out with Thanksgiving at my dorm for the first time. I had signed up because I was a silly little frosh who was signing up for everything—Musical Theatre Guild, lean0nme, Splash, Think, Quiz Bowl, Asymptones, NaNoWriMo—but I enjoyed the camaraderie, enjoyed learning how to hold a knife and butter a turkey and how to make a meal for over a hundred people, and I enjoyed the afterwards, where I watched The Emperor’s New Groove for the first time with a bunch of people I barely knew, all of whom
        have long since graduated.
      


And, then, that Sunday, on the first of December, I went to the Museum of Fine Arts with a friend. It was—and is—a lovely museum, with so much to see. I had just started my journey of starting to appreciate art museums, which, looking back, I am so happy to have gone on. But, the thing I remember most was that, midway through, as we walked between two exhibits, we got a peek out the window, and snow was falling. It wasn’t a lot, but it was coming down, and it was so pretty, and I suddenly felt lighter inside.

As we walked out of the museum—maybe thirty minutes, maybe a few hours later—the sky was darkening, and the whole outside park was covered with this thin layer of snow—maybe an inch, maybe half an inch—and I finally thought, “Hey. I’m home here. I’ve made it.”



And it was this feeling that suddenly I knew where I was supposed to be, and the place I was supposed to be most was here, and I twirled out into the snow, which I had been expecting for months—I mean, in South Dakota, it snows in late September, or early October at the latest—and I thought, “this is great,” and my friend looked at me like, “what are you doing?”

And I thought, and maybe I even said, “you have no idea what this means to me.” And, she didn’t. It was true.

To say I’ve felt at home at MIT ever since is probably a gross overstatement. But, I do know that, that December, I began to feel a lot more comfortable. I began to understand it was possible for me to find niches where the things I cared a lot about lived, and that finding a way forward was possible. I started to just be present; I no longer wanted to leave. I found myself surrounded by people who cared, somehow, from my friends on my wing, to the strangers I made dinner with after a final, on a floor of East Campus I had just one friend on.

It’s been five years since then, yet this story still sticks in my mind. I’ve told it over, and over, in a way such that perhaps my memory of it is corrupted beyond repair, but it just sticks in my brain so vividly, this sense of belonging. It is never true that MIT is easy, and this journey has been full of incredible ups and downs: I can think of semester after semester where I have struggled immensely, or where I’ve made mistakes I would consider anywhere from mild to catastrophic, between things I’ve failed at and people I’ve hurt. At my core, though, I have felt at home here.

This semester—my first semester as an MEng, a graduate student—has returned to me feeling out of place. I don’t really know what I’m doing; or, at least, I don’t feel like I’m making progress in the way I should be. I feel like all the people around me have their lives figured out, like they are on some clear track—the PhD students are settled and working, the undergrads are settled and working, and the other MEngs seem to be as well.

Maybe the answer is just that I’ve never worked like this before. It’s never been true that almost half my time has been devoted to one activity—in this case, TAing. It’s never been true that taking multiple classes—even “just two”—feels like a distraction rather than the primary thing that I’m doing. It’s so much harder to prioritize long-term projects with uncertain and inconstant progress—that is, to do research—rather than to do tasks on a fixed timeline, and I can see the days fly by without progress. No one day is a killer, but in combination, well—

It’s a mode that I’m not sure I can handle. It’s a mode that is difficult, one that I’m not sure fits the way I think. But, it’s the mode that I have to exist in, at least for now.

This Thanksgiving break has given me a little bit of a respite—it’s given me the same kind of break as I got freshman year. I even helped out with Thanksgiving again, and this time, I was not the new frosh, not able to do anything, but the retired exec member sitting around and watching as the new people ran things, and they did a good job, and I knew in my heart of hearts that I had done a good job of training new people, and then letting them go.

But, I am still waiting for the moment where I feel like I have found my place, where I am feeling like I am making positive progress, where I feel like I am doing something I know I can do. I don’t know if that feeling will come to me tomorrow, or the week after, or, really, never. After all, the MEng is designed to be a three-semester program, and I’m one term in, and I’m about to write a thesis proposal about something I really don’t have any clue about, and that’s terrifying.

Even, still, I do remember the feeling of snow on the ground, the feeling of being free and at home for the first time in forever. And, I feel that maybe, just maybe, that feeling might be coming to me again soon. After all, it has come before. The transition, it seems, is just hard, but it is never impossible. Maybe that is true of all things.

And, if not, at the very least, this break has been a good respite. I can breathe once more, and it is once more into the hectic but familiar two weeks between Thanksgiving and the end of the semester. Once more unto the breach, indeed.",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mfa-snow-400x533.jpg,1
art things #1,Gloria Z. '26,2,2023-12-01T00:00:00-05:00,"Although it may not be as apparent as other aspects of MIT, the visual arts presence here (and in the greater Boston area) is super vibrant! There are a ton of resources on campus for making and enjoying artwork, and clubs like Infinite (fashion/design magazine), DAAMIT (digital art), and Borderline (murals) are easy ways to meet other people interested in making stuff. Instead of attempting to provide an expansive overview of the arts at MIT, though, this post will just serve as a log of art-related things I’ve been enjoying in the past few months (numbered #1 because I might make it a series).

One of my biggest goals this semester was to make more and better artwork; I have mixed opinions on whether or not I’ve reached this target (and the semester isn’t over yet anyway), but regardless, here are some things I’ve been making:

 

illustration

All drawn on Procreate on my iPad! I wish I had more time and energy to draw, but alas. Most of these are from September and early October, before classes and exams really started piling on top of each other… there’s nothing like looming deadlines and assignments to really get the procrastination-art going.

I made this as a semi self portrait after dying my hair orange! the tram design is based on the iconic cable cars of San Francisco, which I grew up 30 minutes away from.

a drawing of Magazine Beach, a nearby park facing the Charles River. I took the reference picture on my way to Trader Joe’s :)

some random building in nyc, I liked the way the light fell on its facade

some still lifes, drawn exclusively during lectures

a study of John Singer Sargent’s oil painting “Nonchaloir”. I made this as a homework assignment for 21M.601 before dropping the class due to lack of time. I actually got to see the original painting in person :O!

 

I’ve really been trying to push myself in terms of color and brushwork with my digital paintings, inspired by the visual style of plein air painters. When Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse came out earlier this year, I was absolutely blown away (I watched it three times in theaters in two weeks), and I feel like it filled me with renewed vigor to get better.

 

some pages from my sketchbook

I used to sketch a lot, almost every day! My first art teacher, an elderly Chinese man who taught oil painting out of his garage, instilled in me the importance of sketching from life as often as possible–he would say time and time again that the eye-hand connection is a muscle that has to be strengthened continually. So my high school sketchbooks became visual diaries of my life: I could flip back a few pages and see pencil outlines of strangers at Peet’s, or crack open an old notebook and see marker doodles of cars on top of last year’s algebra notes.

Thus, it’s a little sad to me now that for the past year, I’ve been making very slow progress through the same 100-page Strathmore pad of paper. Weeks slip by without any drawings, and its first few pages date all the way back to my freshman fall. When I do crack open its worn pages, though, I always remember again just how fun it is to draw; there’s something so straightforward and playful about putting pen to paper and just making loose, sweeping lines with abandon.

 

graphic design

I spend an unholy amount of time looking at poster art on Pinterest, so I’m glad I actually sat down and made a few designs this semester! I think the cool thing about graphic design is that you get to actually see your work in use, especially when it comes to merch like hoodies and tote bags. It’s kind of crazy to see people actually wearing and carrying your design around, and clubs and dorms on campus are always making new merch and publicizing events, so there’s no shortage of opportunities to do design work.

ceramics (all WIPs because I haven’t glaze fired them yet)

This has been one of the coolest parts of my semester so far! I’m taking 4.301 Intro to Artistic Experimentation, which takes place in the Mars Lab makerspace. The space includes a mini ceramics studio, outfitted with tools for sculpting clay, a wheel for throwing pottery, various chemical powders for mixing glaze, and a kiln for firing.

the ceramics studio

We started off our clay unit with making little pinch pots, then moved onto different handbuilding techniques like slab and coil building. The steps of making a clay body are as follows: the piece needs to be shaped/ sculpted out of wet clay, left out for a day or two until it’s bone-dry, fired into hardened ceramic (this is called bisque-firing), painted with underglaze and glaze, then fired again in order for the glaze to melt and solidify into glass. I just got trained on the last two steps–mixing my own glazes and loading/running the kiln–so I’m excited to finally finish up my pieces! In the meantime, here are some process pictures:

some freshly built clay things, drying

a tray with a Mitski lyric + dog design. graphite burns away in the kiln, so you can use a pencil to sketch the design directly on the piece for reference

trays in the process of being underglazed. after drying, they’ll be coated with a clear glaze and fired to give them a glassy sheen and make them food safe.

a dragon-themed ring holder. I embedded some broken pieces of stained glass into it before bisque-firing, and the glass melted and crackled into these cool patterns. (some of the glass was from a broken beer bottle I picked up off the street oops)

 

photography 

I’m also taking 4.341 (Intro to Photography) this semester, and we’re currently in the middle of our film unit. To shoot our first rolls of 35mm B&W film, Joanna C. ‘24 and I thought it would be fun to go to a nearby scenic location and walk around in search of cool photos. Due to scheduling conflicts, however, the only time that worked for us both was 7AM on a Wednesday–so, one Wednesday morning, we woke up bright and early and took the blue line train an hour up to Revere Beach, strategically getting off at the stop closest to Dunkin. Two bagels and one iced latte later, we made our way down the beach, buffeted by winds and the occasional ray of sun.

strangers on the blue line

Our film rolls filled slowly with pictures of fat fearless seagulls, frothy seafoam in the sand, and worn buildings facing the horizon. As we stood in front of an old restaurant, squinting into crusted windows, a grizzled man stepped past and remarked to us that they were planning to bulldoze the plot. “They’re going to build more apartments,” he muttered, before plodding on. I squinted into the viewfinder and took my 36th and final shot.

one of my photos: joanna, facing the sea

a “contact sheet” of the images on my roll

The coolest part about working with film is actually developing and enlarging the photos ourselves in the darkroom! It’s such a precise and meticulous process: since the rolls are light-sensitive, they first have to be unwound and respooled in complete darkness, so you have to feel about with your hands for scissors, spools, and other tools. Then, once the spooled film is tightly sealed in a light-safe plastic tank, it undergoes seven washes of various chemicals for various amounts of time, and then is hung in a tall dryer for ten minutes.

the (very well organized and labeled) film developing station

If I were more chemically inclined, I’d include an explanation of what’s actually going on under the hood. All I know is that after the chemical baths, the film is no longer light-sensitive, and we’re left with the negatives of the photos! We then cut the negatives into rows of five and slot them into clear plastic sheets so that they’re nice and visible on top of a lightboard.

cutting the strips of negatives

the plastic sheet

To actually enlarge and “print” the photos, there’s a whole separate process of projecting light through the negatives onto light-sensitive paper, which undergoes its own chemical baths. It’s honestly so cool, and the limitations of shooting with a finite number of shots and having such a long gestation period make each image feel almost like a miracle. I really like the physicality of it all, from having to wind the camera spool between every shot to using your fingers to squeegee water off the roll after it’s developed.

I also got the chance to take pictures at one of Mince‘s popups; they’re a club on campus that hosts fine dining popups for students.

Before starting the film unit, we also worked briefly with digital cameras! Two of those photos:

Metropolis (a community makerspace) started running stained glass trainings this semester, so I signed up for one and made this poorly soldered but still lovable Kirby. There’s no face because the glass pieces for the eyes/mouth would be too small, but you get the idea:

faceless kirby on a star

I’ve also been working on my Infinite spread, which has been really fun. Admittedly, I find myself doing more administrative work than actually making pieces, but there’s an amazing team of fabricators assigned to my spread who’ve been producing some really cool stuff. Our primary form of fabrication right now is metal laser cutting, which we’ve been doing in the MAD (Morningside Academy for Design) makerspace. 

design for a metal “headset” that’s supposed to bend to encircle the ear and head of the wearer (hopefully it actually works)

As an aside, I knew about MIT’s prominent makerspace presence before coming here, but I assumed the spaces would be primarily centered around engineering. Although there is definitely that emphasis, I’ve been pleasantly surprised to find that the maker culture extends to the arts as well. The result is this really cool confluence of cutting edge maker technologies with slow, traditional crafts. For example, in the Mars Lab ceramics studio, besides the standard sculpting tools, there’s also a Formlabs 3D printer that’s set up to use ceramic resin–so it can 3D print elaborate clay bodies with geometries that would be extremely difficult to make by hand. It’s pretty crazy stuff.

an example image from the Formlabs website

 

Besides making things, I’ve also been trying to go to more art-related events both on and off campus. In early November, the MIT Museum hosted an event with Lynda Barry (!!!), a famous cartoonist. My high school English teacher was a huge fan of Barry, and I knew I had to go, if only to send her a picture. Barry talked about the act of drawing as an act of play, and the inherent joy and discovery kids have when they draw and craft stories. The presentation was phenomenal, and the event was discounted to just $5 for MIT students :- D

yayy

MIT ID holders also get free entry to most nearby museums, a luxury I take full advantage of. Boston boasts an incredible selection of art museums, most notably the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA; my personal favorite), and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.

In October, the MFA opened a new exhibition called Fashioned by Sargent. Sargent, AKA John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), was one of the most famous oil painters of his time, and he specialized in portraits. The exhibition explores the relationship between Sargent’s subjects and the luxurious garments they wore for their portraits, and it actually features some of the original dresses displayed next to the paintings. I went with a few friends, and that was where I got to see Nonchaloir in person!

it was smaller than I expected tbh

Finally, I went to the Boston Art Book Fair with Teresa J. ‘26. It’s an annual event put on by the Boston Center for the Arts, and it offers workshops, panels, and booths put on by over 140 exhibitors selling various printed matter. The exhibitors range from established publishing companies (e.g. the MIT Press had a booth there) to independent artists who run their own small businesses. It was so inspiring seeing all the incredible, experimental work and passionate artists, and it took all my effort to not spend money at all of the booths.

So that’s my past few months, benchmarked by various art things! This post is a little all over the place and much longer than I initially planned; it’s more of an amalgam of a bunch of moments than a cohesive story. But the throughline is that I have been finding so, so much joy in the arts this semester, both in creation and consumption. They are fresh and heady and infused with so much life, and I always forget just how joyful it is to make art. It adds hue and dimension to my days, which are usually filled with lectures, problem sets, and my laptop screen (which, don’t get me wrong, my technicals bring me joy and fulfillment too, just in a different way). And for that I’m extremely grateful.

Anyway, we’re entering the last month of the year now! I hope December is just as dappled with flecks of paint, dried clay, and eraser shavings!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cablecars-1000x563.png

Always the Art Kid,Jessica Z. '27,9,2023-11-28T00:00:00-05:00,"When I was younger, people called me the “art kid.” I distinctly remember the first job I ever wanted to be was an interior designer. I drew lopsided houses in school and haphazardly scribbled drawings to proudly present to my kindergarten teacher, who graciously accepted them with a smile. While my desire to be an interior designer
        quickly faded,
      
my hobby of drawing didn’t. I joined window painting, started sketching everyday after school, spent all my money on art supplies, and absolutely adored my art teacher. 

At a certain point, though, I started being coined the “reading kid.” I read books with friends in 
        Reading Olympics
      
and even
        started a Wix book review blog
      
. Even though I didn’t share my book blog with anyone except my family, it was clear that I loved to read. English became my favorite class, and I remember my teachers affectionately teasing me about reading more words that I spoke. As a shy kid, they weren’t necessarily wrong, but I didn’t mind—I liked the way that new words rolled off my tongue.

i have no idea why my face is so distressed in this picture but trust me that i spent everyday begging my parents to take me to the library (thank you to my parents<3)

When I tell people these stories of younger me, they almost always tell me they’re surprised I ended up in science. They tell me that they’re equally surprised I attend a technical school like MIT. Truthfully, I’m still surprised. 

In ninth grade, I transferred from my local public school of 800+ students to a private school with
        less than 200 kids
      
 total. I entered 9th grade with some of my favorite hobbies, art and reading, but started becoming more interested in science after taking AP Biology in 10th grade. Then, one summer, I got my first taste of laboratory research and loved it. From there, my interest in science consumed my time that once went towards art or reading. I taught younger students basic research concepts, volunteered at science organizations, and became really close friends with people from these communities. Unlike my other identities, this one felt like it would truly stick. Identities hold complex meanings and varying levels of importance to people, but for me, I’ve always used it as a way to ground myself. 

Recently, though, I think I’ve been struggling to identify myself at college, particularly here at MIT. It’s been documented throughout the blogs before that a lot of students enter as the “science kid” or some other variation only to be faced with the realization that a significant portion of the student population are also “science people.” While I knew that I would be surrounded by a vast STEM population, this feeling hit me more suddenly last week.

I was scrolling through different MIT classes, musing over different variations of my Courseroad. I recognized that some classes sounded interesting but almost immediately casted them out of my mind:

Hmm…reading seminars sounds fun, but I don’t think I’m into reading anymore. Looking at the IAP calligraphy course, I thought to myself, I like art, but it’s been a while since I tried calligraphy. I should probably take a biology course instead. It just makes sense.

Hmm…reading seminars sounds fun, but I don’t think I’m into reading anymore. Looking at the IAP calligraphy course, I thought to myself, I like art, but it’s been a while since I tried calligraphy. I should probably take a biology course instead. It just makes sense.

Later in the night, I recounted these thoughts to a close friend over the phone. I tried to sound offhanded, but I had a nagging feeling of underlying frustration. And then, all of a sudden, it hits me that I am scared.

I am scared of taking a class or activity outside of biology because it is what I’m comfortable with. Strangely enough, though, I am also scared to take
        7.016
      
next semester in case I find out that I don’t enjoy the content; I am nervous to start biology research in case I find myself dreading lab days instead of eagerly anticipating them. Somehow, I am equally fearful of trying new activities as I am to sticking to biology. If I lose
        a key aspect of my life,
      
I will feel more lost that I already am. And where, then, does that leave me?

I talked about these feelings to my friend again the next day:

“I’m not the art kid anymore or the reading kid or the science kid. I know I enjoy all of these things, even if I haven’t created a new piece of art or read a book for enjoyment in a while, but I don’t know how I am supposed to define myself now?”

“I’m not the art kid anymore or the reading kid or the science kid. I know I enjoy all of these things, even if I haven’t created a new piece of art or read a book for enjoyment in a while, but I don’t know how I am supposed to define myself now?”

On the other side of the phone, my friend pauses thoughtfully for a few minutes and then begins to talk. The solution she offers is simple: “Why can’t you be a combination of all of those things?”

It seems so obvious that I almost assume I’ve previously thought and discarded the idea before realizing that I haven’t considered this. I let her suggestion sink in and consider what I genuinely enjoy doing in college today. I used to picture myself only focusing on science-related activities for the sake of maintaining my biology interest, but I’ve realized that they all tie back to some of my old hobbies. I like learning FreeCad in my clubs because it gives me a similar feeling of creative freedom that I enjoyed as a kid through drawing; I primarily like my
        STS.011 class
      
 not because of the scientific content but because I genuinely enjoy reading our weekly articles.

Here at MIT, I’m learning that I am a collection of all of these pieces. I am still part of the art kid, part of the reading kid, part of the science kid, but I am still learning, and that is okay. I bought new art supplies and have started reading every night before going to sleep; I’m also planning to sign up for a reading-based IAP class. My self-perception will continue to change, but for now, I’ve found comfort in simply doing what I enjoy, regardless of who I choose to identify myself as.

I’m Not Normal About Friends (Part 1),"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",7,2023-11-25T00:00:00-05:00,"I started watching Friends a few weeks ago. I thought it was going to be an innocuous little break from the stress-inducing shows that I usually choose to watch like The Bear or Black Mirror.

Then out of the blue, 10+ weeks of non-stop assignments gave way to a week of utter tranquility. No assignments due. No exams. I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands.

Like generations of other clueless young adults before me, I was sucked into the Friends zone. I love the show.



Don’t know what Friends is about? Here’s a quick rundown.

I hope this helps

Am I obsessed? Sure. Use whatever word you want. In a bout of curiosity-fueled insanity that is not uncommon in the mind of a 
        sleep-deprived college student,
      
 I sacrificed six nights’ worth of sleep—an offering of my life source for each Friend—to generate data from the Friends script and make sense of it. I wanted numbers. I wanted hidden knowledge.

What’s my purpose for all of this? To find out who’s the best Friends character? No need to. Each character has their own collections of traits that make all of them equally endearing, and it would It’s Chandler be unfair to judge them through such a rigid standard.

My purpose is this: What do certain pieces of data reveal about the characters and their relationships, if it even does?

I split my results into two parts. This post is Part I, which focuses on the dialogue in the show. Part II will focus on the on-screen interactions between the Friends, and I’ll release that sometime in the future.

0 – Overview of Part I

The dialogue in Friends is one of the most important elements of the show. Sure, it’s a sitcom, and it’s in the nature of a sitcom to rely heavily on dialogue. But that shouldn’t undermine how well the writers did with giving each character a distinctive voice, as well as balancing the dialogue so every Friend consistently plays a major role.

I wanted to answer three questions.

- How many times does each character get to speak? Who participates in conversations the most?

- How many words did each character say? Who had the most to say overall?

- How many words did each character say on average? How much does a character tend to say? What does this say about each character’s speech patterns?

To illustrate the difference between these three, imagine that the entire show was just these lines shared between Chandler and Joey.



- I equated (the amount of times that a character speaks) = (number of character cues that they have in the script). In other words, the number of lines that a character has. For example, “Chandler:” appears once in this over-abridged version of Friends, and “Joey:” appears twice.

- Word count is self-explanatory.

- I calculated the number of words that a character spoke on average by dividing their word count by the amount of times they speak.

To apply these questions to the entire show, I used this dataset that documents every quote that each character says in order of appearance in the script, as well as what episode/season the quote occurs in. I used Python libraries NumPy and pandas for my calculations, and matplotlib and seaborn to make pretty pictures out of the data I calculated.

From the .csv file, I used the pandas Python library to organize the information I need into DataFrames, with columns representing characters and rows representing seasons. This specific DataFrame is the total number of character cues for each Friend.

Disclaimer: I’m not a data scientist, or whatever Chandler’s job is supposed to be.

1 – Who speaks the most?



It makes sense why Rachel and Ross take the lead here. The Rachel-Ross plotline is one of the longest and most prominent dynamics in the show. Ross pines for Rachel starting from Season 1, Rachel pines for Ross, and then they get together, and I guess other stuff happens too. I wouldn’t know, I’ve only watched up to Season 3 so far. But I know that their relationship keeps changing over time.

That raises another question. Do the characters’ stats change with each season as the dynamics between them evolve throughout the series?


This line graph plots every character’s percentage of lines within a season, for every season.

Features that I immediately noticed in this multicolored landscape:

Rachel & Ross – Although it’s obvious where Rachel and Ross aggregated most of their stats, I wanted to know why Ross was so prominent in the earlier parts of the show and Rachel was more prominent in the later parts.

Chandler – He hit not only the lowest percentage in Season 8, but the lowest percentage in the entire graph. I even graphed the data with raw totals for each character instead of converting them into averages, and the drop is still there. Because he’s the most goated character in the entire show in a relationship with Monica starting from S4, I got worried if something happened to him and I inadvertently spoiled something dreadful for myself.

I looked up recaps of the seasons to figure out what happened during these highs and lows. I used a reputable academic source to make a rough timeline for both Rachel/Ross and Monica/Chandler.



The whole Rachel/Ross thing is a lot messier than I thought it was. I’d have to look closer into the script to prove whether there’s 
        any clear causation
      
 between relationship status and number of lines, but you can kind of make out a rough correlation.

You can also kind of see a correlation with Monica/Chandler. The good news is that the writers didn’t nerf Chandler in S8—MonChan were just settling into their marriage. You can see in the picture where I accidentally skipped over it because the description of their relationship in S8 was so short.

Monica – The most interesting part to me was that Monica had the 
        highest % of lines in S9.
      
 There’s something to say about how Monica, who had thoughts about motherhood since S1, has the highest percentage in the season where her and Chandler start to build a family for themselves.

Monica: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then? Chandler: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it’s gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? – “The One With the Baby on the Bus”, Season 2 Ep 6

Monica: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then? Chandler: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it’s gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem?

– “The One With the Baby on the Bus”, Season 2 Ep 6

2 – Who says the most words?

I personally don’t think this data is as interesting as the other two, so I’ll quickly go over what I did think was interesting.



Similar to above, the overall stats reflect the whole Rachel-Ross plot line. Phoebe takes last place again, although this time she’s right behind Monica.



The Rachel-Ross Valley show up here like they did in the previous line plot, as does the Chandler Rift.

Otherwise, this line plot is definitely different! Phoebe consistently had the lowest or second lowest % in the previous section, but she even takes #2 in S2 and S3 here. Joey’s stats peak though to take #1 for S6.

2.5 – What about Pheebs?

I need to admit something. This post was originally just going to answer the first two questions: who speaks the most, and who says the most words. It turns out that I’m not the first person to figure this out.

When I was through coding up everything and began writing this post, I came across a post by Yashu Seth that did the same thing, six years ago. The way we gathered our data and wrote up our code is different, but we reached very similar-looking plots. Whelp. At least I can cross-check my results with someone, right?

Both Seth and I got the result that Phoebe takes last place in Total # of Lines/# of Times Spoken and Total # of Words. On one hand, that makes sense. She’s the most independent one out of the Friends.

On the other hand, if I was someone who’s never seen Friends and saw both of those stats, I might assume that Phoebe doesn’t have a lot to say or to contribute to the plot. At least, that logic lines up when I apply this same question to the The Big Bang Theory (dataset used). Sheldon and Leonard take up way more of the show than Howard and Raj does, and you can even go as far to say that they’re more important than Howard or Raj.

bazinga

As a huge Phoebe fan, I know that definitely isn’t true for Pheebs. She definitely isn’t the quietest of the main characters, and she certainly isn’t the Howard/Raj of Friends. There’s a reason why I yell “SHE’S JUST LIKE ME” whenever Phoebe says anything, and a reason why I mentally disowned Howard from the list of fictional MIT alumni.

i love her sm

There’s a whole collection of her iconic moments that I honestly felt like were being undermined in the data that I had so far. There has to be some metric that better represents her character.

And that leads into my final question.

3 – Who says the most words on average?



’tis a resounding discovery for Phoebe and Joey enthusiasts alike. Whenever they speak, Phoebe and Joey both say the most words on average.



I really want to explore why Phoebe’s and Joey’s have noticeable spikes in Seasons 2 and 6 respectively, but since I promised that I would post this today, I’m going to keep myself from adding any more to this behemoth of a post.

 

I also don’t know how to end this post, so um. Here’s a recap.

- Ross and Rachel both said the most lines and the most words overall. This is probably because their relationship takes up a good chunk of the series’ plot lines.

- Phoebe and Joey say the most words on average. This is even more interesting considering that Phoebe had the lowest % of lines and words overall.

But is there a better way to visualize the dynamics between the characters? I’ll leave that for Part II.

Semester of poetry,Uzay G. '26,2,2023-11-24T00:00:00-05:00,"It’s been a while. I meant to post sooner but I got sidetracked, and then I got sick, and here we are. I had an impulse to post something

I’ve been meaning to write about poetry. I’m taking the 21W.771 Advanced Poetry Workshop class this semester, where each week you come in with a poem you wrote and discuss/get feedback and suggestions.

I am really enjoying the class and like how it kind of naturally allows me to set time aside for fluffy / aesthetic stuff like poetry, even if STEM stuff is somewhat crowding the stage.

In highschool actually, the professors I liked most were the ones teaching humanities, like literature and philosophy. I felt like there was a search for patterns I really enjoyed there. It was an exercise in building up a gradual picture of how people answer questions about how people live and what matters to them: through asking questions, or creating images, and then trying to demuddle them. I started writing poems then, but really quite casually.

At MIT sometimes it can feel like a lot of people view humanities as something to deal with and sweep under the rug, but many people also manage to balance a passion for scientific thinking and a passion for “HASS” (Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences).

I wanted to talk a bit about why I like poetry. I feel like in a lot of endeavors here at MIT you need this form of precision and rigor — especially as a math / CS major — that allows you to build powerful systems by understanding how they work and being able to trust them.

But it also means you need to start with some direction of where you’re going, whether it be a problem, a project, or something else, I think the difference is that there’s always some initial idea of what “success” might look like.

What I like about poetry is that when I start writing I don’t have any idea of what success could be. It starts first as a sketch and then that sketch rises and grows as I bounce off ideas and memories.

In this initial phase, I can stumble, take lopsided directions, dive into something else, and it won’t really damage the end product but just bring me to a new perspective on what I might consolidate the poem into.

Once I like the vision, I come back and consolidate the thing to make it a bit more polished, and bring a different kind of rigor here to make things stand together in an (i hope) aesthetic way.

It feels like just following my mind onto a web of images and seeing where I’m taking, picking some things to add on as I go.

And what I really like is that once you’ve written your poem, you can see what it elicits, what this fuzzy compression of what you’re feeling makes other people feel, what it maps to for them.

I like how open it feels, because that openness and relaxation of constraint allows a lot to bloom in unpredictable ways.

I was planning on just talking about poetry on a meta level, but I actually got inspired and decided to write a poem. Maybe it’s a bit confusing, it’s kind of late as I’m writing but I felt an impulse and want to share.

There’s also some little drawings, but my drawing skills are very subpar so don’t pay too much attention to it if you don’t like it.

Ode to shepherdy

 

a year

and a bit more now

on this new continent

 

i landed here

and the kid i was (am?)

felt pierced by a dual lens –

two striking eyes

looking for it all

but seeing nothing

in the superposition

of black

and white



 

like the confusing letters on a page

of this tome I opened

that follows me everywhere –

will the next page I slide open

turn into dust?

 

but I turn and turn

again in all directions

to find resonance

 



 

and that harmony i felt when my dad

sang about a wandering coban (shepherd)

to help me fall asleep

 

but suddenly that memory fades

as weeks pass and i lean towards new pages

and i start reading words and words and words

on the essence of this world

that always felt a bit magical –

 

that called to me

like an elegant equation

that became an infinitesimal fraction

Of a demonic circuit or hamster cage

 

that became a river

of symbols

that became a distant beauty

that holds my will

like the gold at the end of the rainbow

 

and so

I try to understand

and swallow down –

 

swallow down the earth

without vomiting even a single sheep –

i am a greedy monster

that didn’t understand

that to see behind

the silver thread connecting my eye to the world

 



 

i had to stop

and ignite my books and words

to look at the stars

and find the shepherd again –

 



 

that shepherd I want to become

that hears

in the bleating of sheep

An om of the universe…

 



But that om stands still in my ears

For just the life of a breeze –

then extinguishes itself

into obscurity

and rends the earth,

rends my gaze.

 

and the stars disappeared

and I felt alone, so alone

until a spine gushed from my eye

to bury itself in my chest

and embrace my heart

 

so that i remembered

that even the shepherd

knows to come back

and forget the allure of the stars

 

to find once more

human look and touch

and graciously thank

the tapestry and danse

of a world

 

that lets him see

the page and then close it

lets him stare at the sky

and turn his back on it

lets him hug a friend

and then remember these words.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-1.09.25-AM-1000x750.png

eat food to live,Allison E. '27,4,2023-11-24T00:00:00-05:00,"It is Thursday, November 23rd. Or well, it is as I’m writing this. Shush. At home my family will be working their way through Thanksgiving dinner, and then the ensuing food comas, and then the weeklong marathon of leftover turkey, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce. 

Sadly, like a lot of students at MIT, I’m not at home for this Thanksgiving. I won’t be eating my aunty’s pumpkin crunch desserts or my grandpa’s kalua turkey, I won’t be seeing the little cousins who aren’t quite so little anymore, and most importantly I won’t be hanging out with my family in person :((

For those of us still on campus, however, we do have two things to help us cope—✨the power of friendship✨ and ✨the power of cook-for-yourself dorms✨! In fact, 
        my dorm
      
 actually has some pretty amazing facilities for cooking. Each suite has its own kitchen, and the dorm’s big shared “TV Lounge” has its own massive kitchen as well. Kitchens + hungry college students + staying up way too late = everything from cookies to pancakes to tapioca pudding. 

But those are all just little things. Let’s talk about the real cooking equation: kitchens + hungry college students + a desire to pretend at adulting = overly ambitious attempts to cook massive group meals!

My friends and I are actually planning to do a big Friendsgiving cookfest on Sunday, when everyone is back on campus, but in honor of actual Thanksgiving, I thought I’d share one of our previous cooking adventures!

Part 1 – Acquire the Ingredients

There’s a bunch of benefits to going to college in a city, and one of them is the proximity of food! There’s a Trader Joe’s, Target, Whole Foods, Daily Table Grocery, and even an H-Mart all within a thirty minute walk from the dorms. And even better, MIT actually runs a shuttle to all these places every Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday!

So, on one Sunday in October, eight or so of my friends and I woke up at the crack of dawn to catch the 
        12:00 PM
      
 shuttle to Trader Joe’s. We were sitting in the back of the amazingly warm shuttle when one of us realized—hey, we should probably make a list of ingredients!

But wait. We couldn’t do that yet. Because… uh… what even were we going to cook??

Actual Part 1 – What the heck are we cooking??

After much frantic Googling of “easy recipes to cook with friends,” we proceeded to ignore all the Internet’s suggestions and settled on the following 
        incredibly comprehensive plan
      
:

dish 1: udon noodles thing

- pork

- udon noodles (hmart)

- onions

- garlic

- eggs (12)

- scallions

- dashi/chicken broth

- 
        ???
      


dish 2: dumplings

- need some dumpling covering thing (hmart)

- more pork / lamb

- funny cabbage thing / leek / scallions?


        dish 3: muffins
      


- milk

- chocolate chips

- cocoa powder

- flour

Ok. Plan acquired!

Part 2 – Get in loser, we’re going shopping!! 🛍️

There is nothing that makes me feel more adult-ish than putting actual raw ingredients into a shopping basket at the grocery store :D. It took all our combined brainpower to find everything without running someone over with a shopping cart, but eventually we’d collected almost all of our supplies.

After those forty minutes at Trader Joe’s, we sent half the group back to campus with the cold/frozen ingredients while the rest of us got off the shuttle early to take on H-Mart and Target! There, two of the least dumpling-savvy of us were tasked with finding “some dumpling covering thing” and “funny cabbage thing / leek / scallions?” at H-Mart (as well as some other more straightforward items). Needless to say… we had to send a lot of photos to figure out what to buy. And we still managed to get the wrong type of greens. Oops?

After the confusing H-Mart visit, we went to Target and bought 48 eggs. No I will not elaborate.

Then we walked back to campus!
        Ingredients acquired
      
 👍🏼

A veritable cornucopia of ingredients!!

Part 3 – Collect the hardware

Burton-Conner’s big shared kitchen has a bunch of space, but it doesn’t have the actual tools you need to cook. Luckily, our suite kitchens have plenty of supplies to raid, so that’s exactly what we did (while forgetting literally everything and having to take >10 trips). But hey! Eventually we had two pans, a giant pot, a mini pot, three mixing bowls, a bunch of measuring cups, several plates, a bunch of utensils, and after much searching, 12 bowls to eat out of!

Part 4 – Let us cook!

Alright, finally! Cooking time!!

Our numbers had increased from eight to twelve, and with so many pairs of hands and so much counter space, we tried our best to parallelize the process. There was so much going on, but I did manage to get some (very poor quality) photos :D

Missing from these photos is half of our eggs exploding upon contact with hot water (good thing there were another 36 on hand), boiling 12 packets of udon all at the same time (and definitely overcooking it), and making an absolute mess of the kitchen in the process.

Nevertheless, I’m actually incredibly impressed by how much we were able to get done without setting anything on fire, 
        cutting off any limbs
      
, or accidentally ruining anything! More importantly, it wasn’t just a couple people with cooking experience doing most of the work—all of us were helped pretty much equally with everything. It may have taken us literally three hours, but we did it!

Part 5 – Omnomnomnom

The final product!!!

There we are—a complete meal for twelve! Freshly made dumplings with pork & bok choy filling (amid other seasonings), as well as udon with more bok choy, soft-boiled eggs, caramelized onions, and seared pork.

And here I shall take the time to absolutely toot our own horn, because this meal tasted like the fresh tears of a newborn demigod. Absolutely amazing. 100/10. We ate half the dumplings before the udon was even finished, and I think I might’ve had more than three bowls of food… So yum.

Part 6 – Washing the dishes

*sigh*

And then we had to clean up. We washed the giant piles of dishes, scrubbed the stove of all the oil splatters, and wiped down all the counters. We hauled all our materials back up to our various suites, and organized the ingredients back into their little shelves.

But you know what? THAT WAS FUN TOO!! 

Which is kinda wild to me, because at home I’m usually not the biggest fan of the process of cooking. It often feels like too much work for not that much benefit. But I think I’m realizing that, as fun as it is to just sit around with friends and make stupid jokes or build stupid Minecraft houses, doing the mundane tasks—grocery shopping, chopping vegetables, and even washing dishes—with other people is somehow even better. You come out of it filled with a sense of accomplishment, but more importantly, there’s so much open-ended space for more shenanigans :). There’s pointing out unusual foods at the grocery store, or figuring out weird alternatives to cooking hardware we don’t have, or gathering source material for more stupid jokes!

So, to everyone out there recovering from your family cookfests, I hope they went well. I hope your food was delicious, and your leftovers bountiful. Most of all, I hope you had just as great a time cooking with your people as we did. Happy Thanksgiving!!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20231015_181857_Original-1000x750.jpeg

chugging along,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",8,2023-11-22T00:00:00-05:00,"wednesday, november 15

i wake up from a weird dream. it’s five minutes before my alarm goes off. i haven’t woken up naturally in a while, so this is a nice change. i blink at the brightness of my room — my blinds do a terrible job at blocking the sunlight, but i don’t mind, most of the time. instead of reaching for my phone like i normally do, i stare up at the ceiling and think about the dream i just had, still a little disoriented. my cat jumps onto the bed and starts purring before nestling into my side.

i get up, wash my face, get dressed, and have some frozen grapes and chocolate for breakfast.

when i leave my apartment, it’s on the colder side. i pulled out my pink puffer jacket from the closet a couple days ago — an official sign of winter’s approach.

i arrive at my 6.UAR (superurop) recitation. we just recorded short talks for our projects last week, and this recitation is about how to turn those presentations into posters. since i attended the mit microbiome symposium last semester, i’ve got a working poster that i can recycle, but there’s a lot more data i’ve gathered since then, so i still have a lot to do.

after recitation, i walk over to hayden and seat myself at a couch next to the windows with the river view. someone’s left a pillow here, and i wonder if they had a good nap. i send a couple emails and take care of some other business before i gather my things for another recitation — human physiology this time.

it’s a smaller group today, probably because it’s a rough part of the semester, right before thanksgiving break. i really appreciate my TA, though. “i don’t want to make you feel obligated to participate just because we have fewer people,” she said.

she’s excellent at walking us through the content and making sure we really understand what’s going on. it’s a good pace for me, and my notes for this recitation are probably the neatest notes i have in any class this semester.

i grab lunch with chris from the chinese food truck by area four and we eat in building 46. i ask her to measure my pupillary distance so i can buy glasses online — i’m still wearing the same ones i got in 2020, and they’ve been through the wringer. the blue light coating is peeled and scratched, the nose pieces are weirdly aligned, and i can’t look down without having my glasses fall right off my face. people who try them on have told me they’re the most beat-up pair they’ve ever seen. i finally got around to placing an order on eyebuydirect, so we’ll see how they turn out. i got heart frames just for the hell of it because i’ve been wanting them for years, along with normal frames.



after that, i camp out at my lab for the next few hours to run an experiment. it’s a simpler one: i’m testing out our latest biosensor on our wild marine strain collection, and i already generated the supernatants of those strains over the summer. all i really have to do is set up some positive controls and put it in the plate reader.

i’ve got 45 minutes before blogger check-in, and i’m not quite sure where to go, so i wander over to the admissions office early and camp out there. when the time comes, i go over to the snack palace and chit chat with some of the other bloggers. it’s always nice seeing this little community on a regular (enough) basis.

but i have to leave early for an event, and afterwards, i take the T home because it’s cold and dark and i don’t feel like walking. the problem with early sunsets is that once i do get home, i lose all motivation to do any work whatsoever and i just lie in bed, exhausted.

i get myself up around 9 pm to shower. around 11:30 pm, i watch the 7.06 lecture i missed today so that i can speedrun the pset. i’m a little frustrated i didn’t start earlier in the night because it’s a lot closer to my bedtime than i’d like (i’m no longer able to pull all-nighters with my current stamina), but i have been trying to be nicer to myself for needing to take things at a slower pace sometimes. i’ve also got an exam for 7.20 tomorrow that i don’t feel super prepared for, but fortunately, it’s one of those tests that you can take at any point within a 24 hour window, so i’ve got some extra time to study.

i realize i forgot to take my vitamin C and D supplements today. or did i? i don’t remember, but i make a note to take them tomorrow.

i have a little existential crisis about whether my plans for next year are going to work out or not, and i do some frantic googling and hydranting.

i crash back into bed around 1:40.

 

thursday, november 16

i try to wake up at 7:30 again, but my body decides it wants to sleep till 8:30. (i forget my supplements again). i mosey about before heading to an appointment at 10:00, and i hang out around the admissions office for lunch (chipotle). i run into kayode while i’m there.

i’ve got to run to 7.003, my lab class, so i go up a floor and stick my leftovers in the iHQ fridge before making my way over to building 68.

it’s a shorter session today: we set up our plates for qPCR, and we’re starting a new chemical engineering module where we’re working with bacterial biosensors for arabinose. this time, our task is to design PCR primers to confirm proper incorporation of a gene we’re trying to insert.

analyzing our primers to see if they’re good

shea, our wonderful TA, gives us these costa rican chocolates, and since we can’t eat in the lab, we all go and do our in-lab questions right outside the lab, swapping chocolate flavors. (i have orange, and nanako has coffee, which is crazy because it seems like it’s literally just a coffee bean coated with chocolate).

lab class ends early but i still have to go to my actual lab to set up some overnight cultures and grab data from the experiment i did yesterday. it gives me results that make a little more sense than the experiment from last week (because i forgot to include a positive control for a comparison), and the data is beautiful in terms of cleanliness, but it’s not exactly what i hoped to find. i send my graphs to my supervisors and head out.

for 6.UAR this week, we’re giving short talks to each other about our projects and getting peer feedback. i go first because i feel like i’m on a roll from squishing all of my UROP tasks in 45 minutes. i swear, when i give presentations, something inside me just takes the wheel and i’m barely aware of what i’m saying. it’s like i’m possessed by a professional demon. i hardly remember it afterward. probably adrenaline.

it goes well, though, even though i flounder a bit at the end and go over time — i just need more practice. my group is friendly and thoughtful. the TAs give us water and superurop t-shirts. they’re a bright blue color with red text. i’m not sure i’ll wear it on a regular basis, but i won’t say no to a free shirt.

i’ve got to pick up meds from CVS, and i end up waiting 45 minutes because they’re not ready when i go. but the lady at the register was really nice, and they were insanely cheap. thank you, insurance.

i go home, put some rice in the rice cooker, take a shower, and eat leftover yellow curry from pepper sky’s for dinner. then i cram for my 7.20 exam and take it. it really wasn’t bad. i’m absolutely exhausted afterward, though.

i conk out around midnight.

 

friday, november 17

my alarm goes off at 7:30 but i actually get out of bed around 8:30, maybe carrying over from yesterday morning.

(i forget my supplements again. i fear it may be a lost cause.)

chris and i go to brookline lunch together. their baklava pancakes are a RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE. i get shakshuka this time, and it’s truly truly truly heavenly. worth every cent. i would spend the rest of my days eating here and supporting their business if i could.

HEAVENLY HEAVENLY FOOD

we have 7.06 recitation together where we get to see yet another lovely TA. all of my TAs are so great this semester. i notice that at least three people in the recitation are wearing the mit biology sweatshirt (the front of which can partially be seen in the photo of shakshuka). i think it’s kind of funny. it is a good sweatshirt.

i’ve got a free hour before i meet zoe for lunch, so i go back to iHQ to grab my chipotle from yesterday and start writing this blog before heading out again.

it’s abnormally nice today — it feels like late summer, almost, and when i open the door i’m greeted with a huge gust of wind.

zoe and i meet up at the stud, on the second floor, next to where all the restaurants are. it’s been a while since we dedicated time to hang out, even though we see each other one to two times a week in 6.UAR, and i really value this opportunity to catch up and spill tea™. we met each other ages ago at isef in 2019. it’s been wonderful to watch each other grow and find ourselves and have more stable relationships with others around us.

i pick something up at new vassar, and make it back over to my lab. i’ve been spending a lot of time on my UROP this week, which i feel good about. we’re doing mass spectrometry to examine some of the molecules produced by our positive control strains, and today, we’re performing an extraction with ethyl acetate (an organic solvent). rachel walks me through the steps and i’m grateful for her patience.

i walk back and i’m so tired from standing up for three hours straight in the lab that the first thing i do is lie in bed for an hour, scrolling on my phone. it’s a well-needed recovery.

later, i get ingredients to make hot chocolate from scratch with rui, and we watch clouds of sils maria featuring kristen stewart. the movie did not meet our expectations from how it was advertised, which was frustrating, because it felt like it had a lot of potential!

i spend the rest of the night knitting and listening to music.

 

saturday, november 18

i sleep in which means i have a later start to the day. i don’t have too much academic work to do, so i spend the afternoon cleaning my room and the rest of the apartment — i’d been too swamped to do my weekly chores earlier.

i start a load of laundry expecting to be done with it by 4 pm today, but unfortunately and extremely infuriatingly, it seems that all of the dryers in our apartment are incapable of doing their jobs and i have to restart it three times before my clothes are finally dry. it’s not so bad since i live on the first floor and laundry is in the basement (unlike when i lived on florey in east campus and had to traverse five flights of stairs across parallels to do laundry), but the fact that each load is $2.50 makes it all feel exceedingly unfair.

still, i get a lot of other things done today: swiffering, cleaning up my desk and nightstand, wiping my mirror, and deepcleaning my fridge.

back when i was moving in, i noticed that the protective layer on my fridge seemed to be peeling off, and i pulled half of it off before i became preoccupied with other things (aka assembling furniture). today, i finally sit down and carefully peel the rest of it off. it leaves a gross residue, but rui lets me borrow her nail polish remover, which takes care of it. it’s nice and ✨shiny✨ now, and honestly, i think it’s done a lot for that part of my room.

i should’ve taken a before picture because this doesn’t quite capture how SHINY and NICE it is now… i’m also going to decorate it more in the future, it looks pretty bare right now

chris comes over in the evening and we get pepper sky’s again for dinner. sometimes i wonder if the person i always see at the register recognizes my face by now because of how often i go.

we (rui, chris, and i) do some work in the living room as i play a video of a fireplace crackling and overlay the charlie brown christmas album over it. it’s an interesting combination. it sounds like carolers are desperately trying to get our attention outside but we’re just hunkered down by the fireplace ignoring them.

then we watch the first three episodes of the new scott pilgrim anime (!!!) which is EXCELLENT so far and i’m so excited to finish it.

 

sunday, november 19

i pick up breakfast from the donut villa diner in central around 10:30. great breakfast burrito 👍

(i remembered my vitamins today!)

then we migrate over to the 18th floor of the green building, where i work on my 6.UAR showcase poster. it’s not so bad since as i said earlier, i’ve made a poster for my research before, but incorporating my new data is a little tricky. i finish all in one sitting, in about three hours, and i knock out some smaller assignments for 7.003.

it’s 2:30 at this point, and the only assignment i have left for this week is a revision due on wednesday, so i take a break to text some of my friends back and check social media before i head back home.

i chill out for a bit, knitting and listening to sabrina carpenter’s new EP. i’m filled with a lot of holiday joy this year for some reason, which is funny because i’m not religious at all and christmas wasn’t a big deal in my family. but rui said maybe it’s because i’m happier now, which i think is the case. i just really like the idea of celebrating the end of the year with my friends and giving them gifts to show how much i love them.

after that, i finish my last chore from last week — cleaning the bathroom.

chris comes at 7 with ingredients for shrimp and spinach alfredo pasta. we decide to eyeball it, which turns out okay, but there’s a moment while we’re making the sauce where we’re like, “hmm, something doesn’t seem right here.” the parmesan adds a weird taste and makes it bubble a lot, but we save it by adding more heavy cream and crushed red pepper and by the time we sit down to eat, it’s pretty solid, all things considered.

then we go to target to pick up some ice cream and a couple cans of cat food for coffee, since i ran out yesterday and her new food doesn’t get delivered until tomorrow.

we try (and fail) to put up LEDs in my room — they’re too short and the tape keeps unsticking, so i decide to leave it for another time. we watch an episode of scott pilgrim instead.

i’m insanely sleepy at 11:30 with a bit of a headache and i knock right out.

 

monday, november 20

i wake up in the middle of the night at 4:50 AM and doze in and out of sleep until my alarm at 8:00. still, i’m feeling very well-rested. i feed my cat, do some dishes, eat a leftover flour sandwich for breakfast, and head out.

it’s my last science communication (scicomm) recitation for 7.003 today. a couple people present on how to edit our discussion sections and we talk about how to write titles and abstracts for our research papers. at the end, we’re given paper class evaluation forms (which is a first for me, since class evals are usually digital) and hand them in.

i sit in hayden to take care of some odds and ends before my UROP check-in at 11.

my view from hayden

my meeting goes well, and at 12:00 i go to the 18th floor of the green building to microwave the rest of my breakfast burrito from yesterday for lunch.

i need a new backpack — the straps on my current one are hanging on for dear life and i estimate it’s got about a week or two left of use. i’ve been looking at backpack brands and on my way out from hayden i saw two people in front of me with a brand i’ve been eying, so i see this as a sign from the universe to finally place my order.

i’m glad that i’m getting around to replacing the things i need, namely glasses, shoes, and backpacks. i kept putting it off because they’re big investments, but i’m really looking forward to having them come in the mail.

we have a guest lecturer for 7.06 today, harvey lodish. a couple weeks ago, i actually went to a talk by nova pishesha who started cerberus with him and hidde plough, so this feels like a sequel in some sense. everyone in cambridge biotech seems to be connected.

i run to a quick mid-semester check-in with my advisor, and make my way across campus to get free zinneken’s at the stud as part of the UA food security team’s efforts to get student input about food security at MIT.

then i go to the other end of campus again to inoculate an overnight culture for my UROP since we’re performing another organic extraction on wednesday. i run into my supervisors, who are cleaning out the fridges in our lab to make room for more samples.

i can’t help but feel like i’m doing more zigzagging across campus than i’d like, but my last activity on campus for the day is to grab food at the weekly community dinners they organize in building W11. it’s shepherd’s pie and pasta today. very tasty.

i head back home. it’s cold out, and i immediately get under the covers when i come back to my room. chris shows up sometime later and we watch the rest of scott pilgrim takes off with ice cream. i’ll avoid spoilers as much as possible, but knives chau dyes a red streak at one point, which looks a lot like my current hairstyle.

knives is on the leftmost side. like other than the sidebang, that’s my hair (though mine’s a little longer!!)

(by the way, PLEASE watch scott pilgrim takes off, it makes me so happy and it has such amazing character development and animation)

i wind down at 11:30 just like yesterday, which has in general been a huge improvement from my typical 1-2 AM bedtimes.

 

tuesday, november 21

once again, i get up around 7:30 AM and get ready for class at 9:00. it is super cold today — it’s 24 degrees when i check the weather, and i bundle up with my pink puffer, a scarf, and gloves.

there’s this tweet by the men’s fashion guy that says, “i dont know who needs to hear this, but your identity is not your job. your identity is a sick ass jacket everyone recognizes you by,” and i really feel like i’m embodying that with my puffer. i’ve had people tell me they immediately know it’s me from a distance just from seeing it.

in 7.20, we’re starting the cardiovascular system after finishing up some content about muscles. there’s a bio thanksgiving lunch happening in 68, so i go there at 11:00, intending on doing some work in the scholar’s lounge, but there are people there, so i’m forced to go to the bio undergrad lounge instead, which is a lounge that makes me sad. it’s tiny, the only amenity is a water cooler, there are no windows… it gets the job done though, more or less.

the thanksgiving lunch is a banger: they have good food (no dry turkey) and fancy plates. “they’re bamboo,” the person serving me turkey tells me. “to be a little more eco-friendly.”

i run into estin at the event, my lab partner for 7.003, and we chat for a bit before we go to class. the thanksgiving lunch is being held where our class usually is, so we’ve been relocated to a classroom in stata.

lab today is short: our only task is to analyze our qPCR data from last thursday, and it’s looking really good!!!

exactly what we want to see (noticeably more FUS1 expression in the wild type yeast treated with alpha-factor, a mating pheromone, and barely anything in the other categories)!!

before heading home, i inoculate another overnight culture, and once i get back i see that the spring 2024 schedules have been released on websis.

i spend the next couple hours hydranting my spring schedule. i have a working plan for how i want next semester to go, but if things go wrong, i have room to drop things.

i make some sausage spinach pasta for dinner and it seems like my bedtime has been shifting earlier and earlier, because i pass right out at 10:30.

 

wednesday, november 22

my 7.20 recitation is held at 9:00 over zoom today to account for thanksgiving travel plans. it’s just me and three other people when i join the meeting, but we make it work, and my TA is wonderful as always.

i have therapy at 10:00 right after that, and i head to my lab at 11:00 to do my organic extraction. i always pass by the cambridge candy factory on my walk to campus — did you know that cambridge used to be a huge hub for candy-making? this is one of the last factories still standing, and in october around halloween, i’d pick up on the distinct scent of caramel apple pops (or something similar), sending me right back to 7th grade when caramel apple pops became a social currency for some reason. today it smells unmistakeably like chocolate.

the candy factory! it looks pretty nondescript from the outside

my extraction takes way less time than i thought it would, probably because i’ve done it once before. they’re tucked away in the fridge for mass spectrometry this weekend, which is when we’ll see if we did it successfully or not.

i come back home and eat lunch and send some emails. after that, i’ve got nothing left to do for the week — thanksgiving break is here, and it’s time to relax and hang out with friends.

 

and to those who made it all the way down here: thank you for coming along with me on this little time capsule of my week! i hope my mundane day-to-day activities are of some interest. happy thanksgiving <3 eat good food","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3002BC45-11B5-4CEC-B620-E900C4D4D1B7-1000x1333.jpeg

"It’s Your Future, Charlie Brown!",Kayode D. '27,4,2023-11-20T00:00:00-05:00,"There’s a lot I could say
      
 about the Peanuts Comics, Christmas Music, entertainment and media as an industry, and the power of a holiday special. I could probably write three of four different blog posts about just what I say in this post, but I think it can all be best summed up with

“I love Charlie Brown.”



The year was 2010. I was excitedly awaiting the surprise Mrs. Patterson had alluded to all week while we sat on the floor of her kindergarten classroom (the class next door even came over to join us, it was that big a deal). There was a knock at the door, and she wheeled in the thing that made dreams come true: the good old roller cart TV.

She pulls out a DVD and starts up “A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving” on DVD. I had never seen this show, and was unimpressed by the vintage style of animation. By the end of the film, however, I was captivated. It was so entertaining to watch Peppermint Patty invite herself to “Chuck’s” Thanksgiving dinner, and Snoopy wrestle with a lawn chair.

It wouldn’t be until November of last year when I visited Boston for the first time that I realized how instrumental Charlie Brown was, not just for me but for television as a whole. I was on the flight back from Boston, after college tours of Harvard, MIT and Yale, fully confident I would not get accepted to any of them. Stressed out of my mind, I watched some of the free TV on the airplane. One of the options in the weirdly niche selection was “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” I’d seen it before on TV, but had forgotten just how good it was.

It had a completely different pace from shows made today. It was very wholesome, had instantly recognizable characters that needed almost no introduction, and had a thoughtful Christmas message. With 25 glorious minutes of meaningful content, a $96,000 budget, and an absolutely banger soundtrack (that I’ll talk about later), I began to appreciate Charlie Brown for the masterpiece that it was.

A Crash Course in Charlie Brown

If you’ve somehow never heard of Charlie Brown or the Peanuts comics in the last 73 years, here’s the rundown: Charles Schulz began writing a comic strip called “Li’l Folks” in 1950 that would quickly turn into 
        Peanuts
      
and featured Charlie Brown, a caricature of Schulz. Charlie Brown is an average boy that somehow seems to fail at everything. He’s nervous, lacks self confidence, often suffers, and is frequently described as a 
        “lovable loser.”
      
 He’s the ultimate underdog! He leads a baseball team that once lost a game 123-0, but still he never gives up. His ragtag group of misfit friends embark on everyday adventures that readers all of the world have enjoyed and connected with. From embarking in search of The Great Pumpkin, to discovering  
        the true meaning of Chrismas
      
, Peanuts has impacted people all over the world and changed comics, television, and Hallmark Christmas cards forever.

After appearing on an issue of Time Magazine in April, 1964, and a sponsorship from Coca-Cola, a TV special began development. Due to the small budget, short time frame, unorthodox use of child actors, and lack of any laugh tracks, the special was expected to be a flop. The special turned out to be a phenomenal success, being a seasonal television hit every year until 2022, when it became exclusively available on Apple TV.

Charlie Brown would go on to have 46 TV specials over the next 58 years, and thousands of comics. On February 13th 2000, Charles Schulz died only hours before his final comic would release to announce his retirement.

The Music

Charlie Brown has an absolutely BANGER soundtrack. Made by Vince Gauraldi, the Grammy award winning soundtrack of original and classic christmas songs cemented the Charlie Brown in history (and the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress, apparently.)

My senior year of highschool, I took a jazz ensemble class that ended up having only 6 kids in it. I played bass guitar, and due to the class size, we played a lot of small jazz combo pieces, including songs from the 
        Charlie Brown Christmas Soundtrack.
      
 I’ll never forget the Linus and Lucy bass line or my friend Sam’s crazy guitar solo on What Child is This.

Charlie Brown also has some REALLY cool musical items:

Imagine pulling up to the college halloween party dressed as Joe Cool, classic college student (explained more later). It’s a great party…but there’s no music!! Just when all hope seems lost, you whip out your Officially Licensed Peanuts x Crosley Cruiser Record Player, and your Vince Guaraldi – It’s The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown Record [Orange Pumpkin-Shaped Vinyl – 45rpm] and put “The Great Pumpkin Waltz” on full blast!! Instant party saver.

I do really want that Great Pumpkin record, though. Newbury comics has it, and I want it so, so, SO bad it’s not even funny.

The Erosion of Deep Literacy: What Grinds my Gears

A few months ago, when I was looking for something to read on our family bookshelf, I found a piece of Peanuts history. For whatever reason, my family had a special 50th Anniversary Hallmark collection of Christmas Peanuts comics. While reading them, I began to appreciate the Peanuts series for how great it really was. I could watch the characters grow, from their infancy in the 50s to their slightly older childhood in the early 2000s. Slowing down to read the comics put things in perspective for me; I’m so used to fast paced, dramatic entertainment, and I think I know why.

In senior English class last year, we read an essay called “The Erosion of Deep Literacy”, by Adam Garfinkle. Essentially, the essay claims that our attention span for deep reading and insight has gone down significantly with the rise of technology. Garfinkle argues that with the new generation’s adult reading habits, and the way that media speeds up and overloads our brains with information, we are prevented from sustaining attention long enough to consume 
        deep literacy.
      


Reading this essay was like looking into a mirror. I saw how technology has impacted my attention span, especially since the beginning of the Covid pandemic. During quarantine, I would come up with dozens of great ideas for board games or stories– more than I could fit in 2 notebooks. Now, out of the pandemic and with significantly more screen time, I feel less creative. I know that technology is not the only factor in play, but this article opened my eyes to how impactful it was to my mind.

The article goes even deeper into what it is about technology that lowers our attention spans. “Continuous partial attention,” a phenomenon created by the multitasking nature of most social media platforms, is pervasive throughout our generation these last few years.

You need only open instagrams, tiktok, or youtube, and you can see the strategies these companies use to keep you glued to your phone. You jump from interesting topic to interesting topic, never going deeper than a shallow glance, and as a result, you are trained to expect this.

What’s more frightening, with 
        fingerprinting,
      
  companies can track you across apps and there is virtually no way to stop them from keeping you glued to your phone.

When Charlie Brown was first coming out, this was not even a possibility. Readers were limited to one strip per day, and one special per year. This portioning of media created demand and appreciation of the comics, which would allow for more thoughtful interpretations and deep reading.

Now, with the rapid growth and accessibility of media outlets, I fear that we are going to a place without deep literacy and the creativity that it brings. I can barely sit still writing this; I used voice typing to draft the majority of this blog! I’m not sure how to fix this issue, but I think that drawing attention to the issue will be necessary to combat it.

I think this line from Garfinkle’s article speaks volumes about society today.

“In science fiction, the typical worry is that machines will become human-like; the more pressing problem now is that, through the thinning out of our interactions, humans are becoming machine-like.”

Franklin might be my favorite character in all of peanuts. He’s insanely cool, the only black main character, and lives across town from Charlie Brown. I connected with Franklin a lot when I was younger, being the only black kid in every one of my classes during elementary school. It was exciting to see a black kid drawn in the stories back then, and I often drew myself with the diagonal lines that gave Franklin his skin color in the comics.

Franklin was introduced following Martin Luther King Jr’s death, at the insistence of one of Charles Schulz’s friends. The friend sent him a letter encouraging him to include an African American character, but Schulz thought it would seem condescending toward black readers. After months of persisting, Schulz finally had an idea for a comic that would introduce his new character, Franklin, into the story. But instead of being a side character, Schulz made Franklin into a permanent main member of the cast. The company Schulz worked for tried to persuade Schulz not to air the comic, but Schulz threatened to quit making Peanuts comics if the Franklin strip was not released exactly as Schulz had written it.

After Franklin and Charlie Brown spent a day playing at the beach and realizing their similarities, Charlie Brown enthusiastically invited Franklin to spend the night at his house, giving Franklin a permanent place at the Peanuts table. There are countless stories of people reading the Peanuts comics and identifying with Franklin. The integrated nature of his appearances combated the racial hostilities present in America during his debut, and his presence in the Peanuts strip helped people identify with media more.



Franklin’s appearance in Charlie Brown paved the way for future black characters and comic artists, like with Robb Armstrong’s comic, Jump Start. Franklin is part of the reason that Armstrong wanted to become a comic artist, and in 1994, Franklin was given the last name Armstrong in honor of the Jump Start Comic artist.

This later inspired The Armstrong Project, a collaborative effort to support black artists and media creators at historically black colleges and universities across the US. There have been some pretty sick collaborations, like with Harlem Fashion Row and Target. More info is available at https://www.peanuts.com/the-armstrong-project, and I highly recommend checking it out.

[Franklin plays the drums and I play the drums. I really am just like him, for real.]

Joe cool

Joe Cool is the ultimate representation of a college student. Introduced on May 21st, 1971, Joe Cool is One of Snoopy’s many fantasy lives, not to be confused with his careers as an author, caterer, Attorney, and World War II flying ace the Red Baron.

Joe Cool is featured in many comics often incorporating his signature line “here’s Joe cool standing outside the Student Union eyeing chicks.”

While this may be a very exaggerated idea of what a college student was like in the 70s, there is a lot of relatability in it that I think a lot of college students can identify with (see below).

I strive to someday be as cool as Joe Cool. His appearance in the TV Special, “You’re Not Elected, Charlie Brown!”, also introduced the song “Joe Cool”, another absolute banger from Vince Gauraldi.

So What Now?

I could go on and share more niche Charlie Brown lore, like the story of Jose Peterson, a short-lived Mexican-Swedish batter on Peppermint Patty’s baseball team, but I digress. I’ve already said enough in this overly committed blog post. You can explore the beauty of Peanuts for yourself on Apple TV, or by googling the comics (some are very, very funny).

Last month, Peanuts released the 50th Anniversary Edition of the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Playlist, and what better way to celebrate than sharing it this holiday season! Whether you celebrate or not, this album slaps, and has new alternate takes of the reprises and some of the songs. Give it a listen! or listen to this playlist I made of my favorite Charlie Brown songs. I’m going to 2 Friendsgiving’s

journey to the end of the world,Ali C. '26,5,2023-11-16T00:00:00-05:00,"Create New World

i started playing minecraft again three weeks ago. i created a new world, i booted up survival, walked around in some caves, and got a few diamonds. diamonds! i won—and that’s where the story-script ends. 

i didn’t know what to do next. when i don’t know what to do, i just carry on what i’m doing right now. so i kept on exploring caves deep underground, mining a good amount of gold and lapus lazuli and a couple more diamonds. i saw a lush cave: an oasis deep underground filled with light, vines, grass, flowers, glow squids and glow berries, and the occasional axolotl. lush caves weren’t around when i first started playing; it’s a small reminder of the time that’s gone by since i was a little kid, playing minecraft in utter secret while my mom wasn’t looking.

i walked and walked. and so the idea slowly came to me: what if i just kept on walking? how far could i get? thus, began the journey to the end of the world.

 

 

 

each time you start a new game, minecraft has algorithms that randomly generate a new world. terrain generation is a little problem that i really find quite interesting. this is going to be me nerding out a bit, so get ready. here’s a very basic walkthrough: for starters, imagine trying to come up with a way to automatically generate a pattern of natural-looking terrain or peaks and valleys. 

more specifically, say we want to generate a patch of 128 by 128 meters of land. the most naive approach would be to just use a random number generator on each square meter, producing something that looks like this:



this is random, but it looks like goop, not terrain. after all, it’s not like at every meter of terrain the height is chosen completely at random (which is what we’re doing here). instead, maybe we want to pick the heights at only every sixteenth meter, and then fill in the middle with straight lines and planes:



this is more convincing but still looks a little weird. the reason is that the slope of the ground changes suddenly at the grid points; this doesn’t happen in real life. to fix this, we can connect the grid points using cubic-shaped curves, i.e. “bicubic interpolation”, which yields something like this:

however, if you look closely, it’s still not super convincing—imagine if the first astronauts looked down at our blue planet and noticed that the peaks of earth’s mountains and the base of earth’s valleys all laid upon a conspicuous grid. that’s what happens here, as the lowest lows and the highest highs tend to be near each sixteenth meter. the thing minecraft uses is called perlin noise; it’s a bit more sophisticated, so it looks pretty much perfectly natural. but that stuff is unfortunately beyond the scope of this blog post.

 

 

 

End of the World… in Classic

in the embryonic versions of minecraft, the generated worlds were finite. the strange, blocky, over-saturated world just ended at some point, beyond which was an endless ocean. this stage of development was mostly called ‘indev’ (in development); indev was the second phase, after classic. after around three months of indev came the next phase: infdev; infinite development. so fundamental was the infinite world to minecraft that it marked a whole new phase of development.

 

 

 

The Badlands

after i decided to walk to the end of the world, i followed the caves back up to the surface, first out of the deepslate zone, and then all the way into the dirt. finally, i surfaced; it was daytime, the sun was out. i had spawned in a pretty generic birch forest and there wasn’t much to see. if i wanted to walk, i should pick a direction. in minecraft the sun and moon rise in the east and set in the west. i looked up at the sun; time to chase the sun, i thought. i will go in the direction the sun sets: i will find out where it goes after the day grows dark.

thus, i ventured out. i sprinted forward, navigating between birch trees, making progress block by block. i came upon rivers; i swam through them, slowly. (swimming is slower than sprinting in minecraft, so i avoided water when i could.) every few minutes i’d leave one biome and go to the next; i saw the spruce biome, swamp biome, mountains biome, plains biome, savannah biome. after a couple days (each day is ten minutes in game) i found myself at the shore of an ocean. i wouldn’t be able to swim across it. so i crafted a boat, hopped on, and started rowing, chasing the setting sun, not knowing how long it would be until i reached the shore again.

i came across broken nether portals, shipwrecks with buried treasure maps, strange, abandoned-looking buildings in the jungle with traps, the new mobs like bees and llamas, wandering traders, and of course, villages. villages always feel a bit hopeful. villagers seem to occupy this weird space in-between the soulless mobs and the souled players; i never know what to feel about them, especially the baby villagers. after a couple villages, i stop gawking at them and i just go straight to the blacksmith to loot the chest for diamonds.

after a while i realized that i should probably save my progress so that if i died, i wouldn’t have to start back out at the origin. thus, i killed each sheep i came across for their wool, and each day as the sun started to set, i built a crafting table, a bed out of 3 wool and 3 wood planks with the crafting table, used the leftover wood plank (logs generate 4 wood planks) as a decorative block next to the crafting table, lit up the side of a wood plank with a torch, and went to sleep. sleeping resets your spawn point, so if you die, you’ll wake up at the bed you last slept in, as if nothing had happened at all… well, minus you losing all your stuff. but i had changed the game rules that you wouldn’t lose your stuff when you died. i don’t like dying.

 

 

Cherry Blossoms

see, the thing about minecraft is that the world actually isn’t infinite. (i think this is pretty well known among people who play the game; and i really don’t know much about the game, but here it goes.) 

to understand why, it comes down to fundamental limits on the numbers your computer can efficiently represent. the 32- or 64-bit number is the computational unit; your computer operates entirely through adding, multiplying, subtracting, ANDing, NOTing, etc. these operations are executed in your computer by running electrons through tiny wires. your computer must be manufactured with a certain fixed number and configuration of these tiny wires; how many wires you need depends on how many binary electrical signals—bits—you need to represent numbers. so you need to cap the amount of physical space a number can take up. and just like how you can’t get numbers bigger than 999 with three digits, restricting the space any number can take up restricts how big the number can be.small caveat: you can use software to chain multiple hardware numbers together and get numbers as big as you like, but this is slow, so we don’t do it all that much.

around the limits of how big numbers can get, computers get weird. for integers, you can add two large positive integers on a computer and get a large negative one. for fractional values, you can get a computer to tell you that 4,000,000.0 + 0.1 = 4,000,000.0; large values are not precise and 4,000,000.1 isn’t a number the computer can record. for minecraft, this causes issues. for example, if i’m at position x=4,000,000.0 and i move 0.1 blocks forward, the computer computes my new position to be 4,000,000.0 + 0.1 equals 4,000,000.0; i.e. you won’t move at all. you’ll need to move faster if you want to be able to move.

the farther you get away from the origin, the stranger the game gets due to these effects. the game itself slowly unravels. most of the effects have been fixed by now, but i noticed more jittery movement on top of boats and of items even in my journey as i got further out. most of these effects were benign; jittery movement; glitching particles; blocks appear flat. as you go further, they get more serious. with each power of two, it gets more jittery and more blocks render wrong and the faster you have to move in order to move at all, and most of all, at around 12 million blocks out, the terrain generation algorithm totally and completely glitches, creating the famed far lands of minecraft:

SPONGE

the far lands are the tell-tale sign of minecraft’s digitality. the world you’ve grown up in has suddenly revealed itself to be of a peculiar nature.  the world you see is a bunch of numbers spinning up and down in preprogrammed ways, electrons flowing through prefabricated wires, a giant trick, an illusion. the glitch dispels that illusion of the world, the existence of the world, and reveals the truth—if you look hard enough. 

and a part of me is convinced that something isn’t fundamentally real about the real world too; certainly, the world i believe that i live in isn’t real. it is a mere illusion imposed on the world by my consciousness, my experiences. the person i am today is not the person i was a year ago, or two years ago, or five years ago, and as i change, the world around me changes too; places take on different meanings, the success i think that would fulfill does not fulfill, the small moments i never think would fulfill do fulfill, far more than the first. and after a few years of consciousness, it is painfully obvious to me that the world i have come to know is not at all the world that’s truly out there. but what is the world? what is the true nature of our experience? what are the far lands of real life?

 

 

 

 

Ice Spires

a few months after stepping down from developing minecraft, notch (the creator) started working on a new game. it was called 0x10c, blurb:

In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space travel was gaining popularity amongst corporations and rich individuals. In 1988, a brand new deep sleep cell was released, compatible with all popular 16 bit computers. Unfortunately, it used big endian, whereas the DCPU-16 specifications called for little endian. This led to a severe bug in the included drivers, causing a requested sleep of 0x0000 0000 0000 0001 years to last for 0x0001 0000 0000 0000 years. 
It’s now the year 281 474 976 712 644 AD, and the first lost people are starting to wake up to a universe on the brink of extinction, with all remote galaxies forever lost to red shift, star formation long since ended, and massive black holes dominating the galaxy.

the composer of minecraft’s original music made a track for it too, which is also quite beautiful (i highly encourage you to listen): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIrYK_iZQME 

what fascinated me was just how far in the future the game was set. the end—what will happen, when it will happen—is fascinating; there’s even a word for the study of the end, eschatology, which i learned a few months ago in 21L.320. as a kid i loved looking at wikipedia’s timeline of the far future; reading how the world was going to change in a thousand years, ten thousand, a million, a trillion, how the world we know now is going to slowly decay until it becomes unrecognizable, glitch by glitch, and how at some point the last human who ever will live will die, and the last star that ever burns will go dark forever. this kind of future isn’t seriously tackled very much in popular sci-fi—there is The Last Question, maybe—that’s what drew me in.

but 0x10c never got made—the pressure was too high and “it just wasn’t fun anymore”.  around a year ago, i stayed up late one night listening to that music track over and over. wondering what could have been, wondering what they saw far away at the end of the universe, this all having raised up an image in my head of a world that no one will ever live to see.

 

 

 

 



the game was fixed, and the far lands don’t exist anymore. instead, there’s just an artificial world border that you can’t cross at thirty million blocks out. that would be the endpoint of my journey. but i still had just about thirty million blocks left to go.

at around sixty-five thousand blocks, maybe a good fifteen hours spent on this, i was rowing in the ocean with my dog rotisserie (or roti for short) in the boat with me. thankfully, dogs will get into boats, and two entities can ride a boat at a time. i was looking at the horizon and at the setting sun. things had gotten quite monotonous, i was just pressing W and staring at the screen, searching for any sight of land.

then suddenly the rendered border started getting closer. it had never done that before; it stayed a fixed distance away. the void i could see at the end of the ocean grew closer and closer, and in a couple seconds i had run into it—i was in the void. i tried to move, but i could not move. i could see where i had come from; water lay just a few blocks away, but pressing w, a, s, d, space, did nothing. i stared at the sun, which i could now see laying below the horizon for the first time. i could see the red, dimming sky of sunset. i could see the front of the boat. but i was stuck. 

the illusion popped.

trying to figure out what to do, i entered a command to teleport myself back into the water. it worked; now i was in the water and roti was in the boat which lay in the void. i stared at roti, floating in the void, in the boat, happy as can be. 

there might be a way to fix this glitch, but maybe i shouldn’t spend more time on this anyway. i swam closer, cautious to avoid being pulled into the void again.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ezgif-4-3a9a40c582.gif

a time capsule of east campus,Kanokwan T. '26,0,2023-11-12T00:00:00-05:00,"i’ve been in a funny little writing rut, far away from the keyboard and tightly wound up in my thoughts. this blog overwhelmed me because i was scared to do it right. but, i think it’s important to share with the world, and people sent in truly wonderful digital artifacts, so i eventually dusted off my blog draft document and got to it. i hope you enjoy these glimmers of east campus. <3

i’ve been in a funny little writing rut, far away from the keyboard and tightly wound up in my thoughts. this blog overwhelmed me because i was scared to do it right. but, i think it’s important to share with the world, and people sent in truly wonderful digital artifacts, so i eventually dusted off my blog draft document and got to it. i hope you enjoy these glimmers of east campus. <3

five months ago, i poorly planned packing my bags, begrudgingly all-nightered to get all my items stored away, and eventually moved out of East Campus (ec). it was not only the dorm i tagged as “home” on Google Maps, but also a place that truly felt like one. i always knew i wanted to live here, mostly attributed to my years of reading the blogs. the physical building was chaotically decorated, the people appeared vibrantly open-minded, and the vibes felt so sweet. i hadn’t quite seen anything like it at MIT, let alone in my life at all.

i do think people find their sense of “home” in many different ways, whether that be captured by the people who they love being around, scenery that brings them peace, objects that capture a memory. one of the greater fears of college, and i guess life as a whole, is finding forms of it. i was lucky enough to find this at my dorm.

dorm thoughts + room tour + panic packing

i had a lot of thoughts about my time at this dorm bottled up in me and didn’t find written words to be the best medium to get them out, so i tried turning on my phone camera and filmed away. for context, it was late and i sound a touch delirious, but i think it’s fine.

ninety-nine years ago, ec welcomed its first ever residents. it’s the oldest undergraduate dorm still standing, and it shows: (a) the culture is rich with traditions, stories, and artifacts, and (b) the building is in dire need of repair. i’ll, of course, miss it as it undergoes renovations for the next 2 years, but i’m also curiously excited. i wonder how ec culture will be afterwards, what new life it’ll take on. i could go on and on and on, but i won’t. 
        i wouldn’t do justice to the century’s worth of people who lived here before me, and the culture that they had built.
      
 but, at the very least, i offer you these remnants that i had found. i looked through my own archives and emailed out to all ec residents for contributions. in this effort to grasp onto whatever bits of ec i could find, i collected a hodge podge of things that capture little bits of this place i still call home.

one: party poem

basically every weekend, a floor of ec hosted a party. my floor hosted the final one before renovations. an acrostic poem (the first letter of every line spells out vertical words) was sent out as the party invite, paying homage to every ec floor (of which there are ten). 







They claim that

It’s the end of East

Campus, that it’s over.

Knowing renovations are near certainly

Makes our last weeks here bittersweet,

As we all must find

New homes in the fall.

1 thing that’s for sure is that the original

East Campus, the building, will be gone.

People, though, will remain. We

Understand that the culture,

The community, cannot be so easily

Zeroed out.

But what about

Everything we feel like we’re leaving behind?

Asbestos and cockroaches can go, but

So many parts of this dorm are

Things we wish we could keep with us forever.

For one, the Courtyard:

Laughter and chatter audible

Over the thump of music, rope swings

Overhead and

Rope darts whirling around,

Pungent burger smoke in every

Inhale near grillz.

Talbot, too, will be missed —

Every FAC, Pinkies, and other event

That took place in our common space —

And even those cook-for-yourself-induced,

Zany nights (and some early mornings) spent

Outside of our beds because

Of fire alarms at ungodly hours.

4 what it’s worth, we’ve called EC our home,

1 in which, within all our ten halls,

We’ve made so many memories.

Such fun we’ve had together — and

Let’s have even more during renovations!

Undergrad life on the West Side can be bland; let’s

Give things a little spice. Don’t you

Feel like the rest of MIT could use some

East Side energy —

Some dyed hair, more welcoming communities, and

The occasional infusion of chaos?

5 floors × two parallels = hundreds of East Campers.

Without the building, we’ll still always have each other to call home.

Forget your sadness, at least for one night:

Let’s celebrate

One last time before

Renovations, before we start a new chapter of EC

Elsewhere than here but equally full of adventures.

You won’t want to miss it.

three: word bubble

i polled ec residents for their top “3 words to describe ec.” this is what they said.



four: feelzbox

in the aforementioned poll, i also added a “feelzbox,” which basically means “write whatever you want to get your feelings out.” these were my three favorite submissions.

“EC isn’t a place; it’s a people. The weird, the creative, the counter-culture – as long as these sorts of people are around, there will always be an EC.”

“EC isn’t a place; it’s a people. The weird, the creative, the counter-culture – as long as these sorts of people are around, there will always be an EC.”

“It wasn’t til I was crying in the club during the last EC Party that I realize how much this place means to me.”

“It wasn’t til I was crying in the club during the last EC Party that I realize how much this place means to me.”

“East Campus set me free.”

“East Campus set me free.”

five: origin of the logo

an email chain was shared in the ec community that detailed the origin of our beloved logo. i asked one of the creators if i could include it in this blog, to which he responded “i don’t remember writing anything incriminating there, so feel free.” here’s the abridged story. 



the origin of the ‘burning (stick)man’ was…around 2003 …and was originally redrawn from some osha logo by sheila l. ’05.

…and was originally redrawn from some osha logo by sheila l. ’05.

sometime later i asked sheila if she’d give me the illustrator file (which, if you’re curious, was actually redrawn and not lifted directly explaining why our stickman has ‘a visible butt’) 
so that i could put it everywhere.

seven: poetry from a resident

some loving, sentimental words

poem A: Away

Talc and asbestos accumulate, in the dust under the radiator, between floors, until the day of a rite. In the middle of marble, a cube of outdoors remains, catching thunder. The Charles will tsunami itself against these walls, someday. You come, trundling down main street, holding

lotto tickets. You are young, and new to freedom. Every time the olderandstranger ones leap, 

of course you leap. You look at your new world, a smear of colors, and you let yourself run amuck, you drag your fingers thru viscous air. Sure, undersides of things are scary, but it can’t spoil the kindness of your big, bright friends. Your true house is warm and filthy. It is in no way optimal. It is in no way functional, and sometimes it is hard to function. You remember being needy, touch-starved, bored. You’re so glad that you found this hell, that this rogue & glowing hell found you. Your true house is full of garbled noise, the place you forgot all hundred digits of pi. The warmth and necessity of this place is indescribable- becoming a human isn’t part of the data the grownups gather. They know neither the sadness and danger of isolation nor the elation of belonging, in ridiculousness and degeneracy, until time do you part. 

poem B: Travelling Zoo: 4/10/19 (all the words/phrases are taken & cut-up from tetazoo quoteboard)

a country is not safe. a husband is not safe. 10 miles, west, texas-y, I 

don’t do anything. In the dark, I am a child, I don’t have a time machine

and it isn’t likely I’ll figure it out.

I look normal. I just want to decapitate vegetables. 

 

In that corner, out of windows, I want to live in a village. I want that now,

Driving in rural Ohio, in Wyoming, in Moldova, I need that now, I need it. Got shocked by an electric fence,

 

I need a forest fire, I need a trashfire.

 

Did you hear that? I need a volunteer fire department. I need a new dimension. I need non-cartesian coordinates. I need 40 gay communists in a warehouse. I need 

Your body. I need the auditory equivalent of a lightbulb. And you can quote me on that.

 

Wait, just wait. 

I feel like an opossum playing dead.

Wait, just wait. 

 

Boom! 

 

 I live here.

I live here! 

 

 On the ceiling, in the fire, roof-and-tunnel, tree-climbing, tonight! 

Tonight! Tonight! 

 

I live here, 

wearing clothing, not wearing clothing, a tall boy, a lesbian, an explorer, a ghost telling a joke. I am a capacitor.

 

 I live here, in glounge, at the loading docks. 

 

 Here is not just a word. Here is so illegal. Here is enough. Here is a get-happy quick scheme. Here is interestingly colored smoke. Here is high on catnip. Here is an absolute nightmare.

 I’m friends with four cats in a trenchcoat. I’m friends with the ghost of an IKEA instruction manual. My friends make me pancakes. My friends go to sevlev. My friends go to locksport. My friends are so old now. Why are we so young and so loud? Good sounds. Hisses of happiness.

I like the sound of people screaming. In Braintree, in Ashmont. Why am I so belligerent? Why am I safe? Why am I fine? Why am I joyous? 

 

Hubris! Hubris! 

Entropy is the enemy of the narrative. 

I would love to be immortal, but unfortunately I haven’t worked that out yet.

 

Regarding your life, your home: it’s an experience, it has a dimmer switch, it ends in a sleep-deprived corpse party, a dollop of midnight,

 

Then time says 

I’m coming in and shutting your window. 

All that bloodflow, all that life, it wobbles, 

It crumbles.

I feel like a Long Lost Child.

 

Where are you all?  What’s the fastest route home?

eight: a video of every floor

during my final evening in ec, i took a walk through every floor before the building officially went offline. 

i figuratively banged my head silly learning how to use Adobe Premiere Pro for HOURS but the job has finally gotten done

final thoughts

perhaps if I painted with light brushstrokes, you can see the painting of ec that I see.

perhaps if I painted with light brushstrokes, you can see the painting of ec that I see.

on any given night, I could stumble on a pocket of fun while winding the halls: people sprawled out around a rickety table playing endless games of nertz, a group about to make a late night sevlev run, others mulling about the corridors in search of a connection. around the clock, 24/7, there’s always something happening—the dorm that never quite sleeps.

i think about the daredevil, unruly spirit of the people here. we wrestle in mystery substances, rappel and climb about caves, taste spicy peppers, spin fire, and ignite Tesla coils. we have communal courtyard screams whenever we feel the urge. we calculate just enough to know we won’t die but dare enough to try. 

most, if not all, floors had a fft (free food table) an fst (free stuff table), where people kindly placed things they found or made up for grabs. I remember one guy carried a big steel pot and walked through every floor of ec asking anyone if they wanted to contribute an ingredient to the communal soup. some people even joined him along the journey as he traversed his route. the kitchen was always bustling: someone cooking up a storm and happy to share with the world. 

we recognize that our ideas, at times, can be bad, and we celebrate it with our annual Bad Ideas Weekend, where the dorm sponsors people to host events that seem like a bad idea.

there is creativity seeping out at every corner. questionably-built lofts can be easily found in peoples’ rooms. murals splashed across the walls. mounts have been drilled into walls and ceilings by residents to suspend hammocks, swings, and other things. music flooded the halls, from both lounge speakers blasting collaborative playlists to people practicing playing instruments in their rooms. one couldn’t help but be inspired.

 

i hope…

you could feel a bit of the heart that beats for east campus

past residents saw a bit of themselves in this

and future residents embrace what has been

my midterm will disappear if i pretend it doesn’t exist if i set down my pen maybe go firespin it will vanish from my todo-list

i’m getting tired of fourier transforms these batteries are short-circuiting my brain If i really forget one more f*cking pset the whole world will hear me complain

i haven’t reviewed this material enough i can’t wait for the semester to end this course is too damn rigrous i hope the exam curve is generous i know i can’t keep playing pretend



 

fight me

if my past self could talk to me

We thrash in the mud so concerned about right and wrong The giver of permission, fragmented by time Lashes out at its own decisions

Stand up and look me in the eyes Tell me what you truly believe Yell so I can hear your words Because the echoes murmur louder

Get up and fight me Are you afraid of your own past? It stands catatonic, unable to die, So wake me up and free me

Face me and show me fears Wasted, without sacrifice I lay to rest your diligence Look how far you’ve fallen

You, a victim of time and circumstance I, a player in a perfect tragedy Vibrant prose dances sentences And dulls an unending chapter

You cry for you’ve kept your eyelids open for too long looking for the light at the end of the tunnel

 

water you doing with your life

how dare i whine that i am hosed when I came this far to drink? how dare I complain about thirst when a sea of knowledge sits right in front of me? i am bored i am chewing on a mat, staring at the sky in fury wanting to do everything and nothing all at once.

Fall Adventures,Jessica Z. '27,4,2023-11-06T00:00:00-05:00,"My favorite season has always been fall. I love walking around campus and looking at the pretty leaves, love MIT’s fall-themed events, love baking cozy desserts, love comfy sweaters, and generally love all of the activities associated with fall.

When colder weather started creeping in during late September, I made it a goal to make the most of autumn
        by exploring Boston more than I did the first few weeks of school.
      
It turns out, though, that one of the best perks of living in Boston is how comparatively easy it is to visit new places or even new states! So far, I’ve been able to explore a little more of Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, and Boston. 

Rhode Island – September 23, 2023

The Northeast Regional Amtrak sells 1-way Amtrak tickets between Boston and Providence for less than $10 on certain weekends, and my friends and I decided to go on a whim because none of us had ever been to Rhode Island before. In an attempt to maximize the time we spent there, we booked tickets that left at 6am.

I was pretty sleep-deprived the next day because I only slept for an hour, but I woke up after we stopped by a small coffee shop. Rhode Island has a similar quiet, small town feeling to my home state, Pennsylvania, so it felt nice to be in a more peaceful environment after the busyness of Boston. My friends and I wandered around Providence, visited the Rhode Island State House, and went to some local art museums.

The highlight of the trip, though, was the food. In an effort to be ~fancy~ college students and remember our first adult-ish trip, we went to a nice restaurant called Massimo for dinner where I ate the best tiramisu of my life.

Maine & New Hampshire- October 9-10, 2023

I live on floor C4 in Burton Conner, and our
        wonderful floor chairs
      
had the idea to do a C4 floor trip to Maine over the extended weekend! I slept for most of the drive up to Maine, but we made a stop in New Hampshire to walk the Artists Bluff Trail, which is a short 1.5 mile loop hike. It was pretty cold, but there was very, very pretty scenery of the fall foliage throughout the entire trail that made it worth it. Afterwards, we drove to the Airbnb in Maine which had a lake in the front to relax by.

Later in the night, we also desperately tried to start a fire to roast s’mores using a variety of different methods, including (but not limited to):

- Soaking a paper towel in vegetable oil

- Repeatedly poking the slightly-burning firewood with a metal stick

- Using a gum wrapper in an attempt to create sparks

- Using hand sanitizer

- Using (slightly rain-soaked) small twigs and firewood

- Twisting a marshmallow roasting stick into the ground

I gave up rather quickly but some people on my floor steadily continued for hours. Unfortunately, we didn’t end up starting a fire (and the lighter ran out of fluid about thirty minutes into trying). BUT, on the plus side, it was very fun, and microwave s’mores taste just as good.

Boston – October 14, 2023

Roughly one month ago, an Instagram post popped up on my feed promoting the Boston Book Festival in Copley Square. I haven’t been able to read very often because of how busy the semester has gotten, but I clicked on the link and thought that it looked like a good event to take a break from studying, especially after midterms.

I met up with a friend I’ve known since freshman year of high school, and we went to visit the local book vendor stands around the square. One of the local authors was giving a presentation about how busy life can become within just a few days and how important it is to take a deep breath, slow down, and put your life into perspective. He had a string across the top of his booth where people could write down a response to “what makes you happy?” I couldn’t take a picture of all of the answers but some of my favorites were:

- “My friends <3 Thank you for your love and support”

- “Knowing I made the right decision, and if I didn’t, it’s okay”

- “Reading with a cup of tea in a fall morning”

- “Playing sports with my best friends at school”

- “Seeing myself become happier every day”

- “My wonderful children who have devoted their careers to public service”

It’s been a very chaotic fall—I went to my
        first concert
      
 ever, found out who my
        sorority big
      
is, ate lots of good apple-themed food at
        Apple Bake
      
 2023, started new hobbies, and visited lots of old and new friends. I also have a lot of
        other activities I want to do
      
before the snow starts to come!

Fall was also admittedly a stressful time since classes started to pick up, and I
        started worrying about my classes more
      
 often, but I agree wholeheartedly with the local author: sometimes, it’s better to slow down, take a deep breath, and enjoy the journey.

home,Shorna A. '25,1,2023-11-04T00:00:00-04:00,"I thought about this post while laying in a fetal position under an oppressively large comforter. A few days ago, my period cramps were as bad as they had ever been, so, after a sleepless night, I took some painkillers, crawled under my blanket, and waited for around 30-minutes, willing the medication to kick in. This time was feverish; I felt as if my consciousness was floating, ruminating on a series of fairly disjoint memories. It was one of those experiences where you come away with distinct feelings, although very little in the way of concrete thought. Here are a few of those feelings.

I felt very old. Concretely, this is simply untrue… I’m 19, which, I think, is universally agreed upon to be an age at which you’re painfully unaware of the world but slowly beginning to realize how little you understand it. I feel myself beginning to develop the sensibilities which render adults dreadfully boring to every child under the sun – a desire for safety, comfort, stability. 

I wanted to be home. I can’t, to be honest, articulate what that means anymore. When I was 17, about to leave Arkansas for Boston, all I thought about was how quiet my hometown was. It was hard to tell if the silence was peaceful or oppressive in that place; it certainly felt stifling. 

When I went home most recently, though, I felt differently. Arkansas is many things, the most obvious being beautiful. I forgot how starry the sky could be, and how blue. It’s almost ridiculously picturesque. Roads built through water-logged pastures, cows grazing between thickets of trees. Vast expanses of green, morning dew accumulating on individual blades of grass and refracting the morning light, ephemeral steam fog rising off of the surface of ponds during the sunrise. Hordes of red-wing blackbirds which move as a hive, settling on fields and turning an entire acre of land a shade darker.

Arkansas is gorgeous, but two years ago, I would’ve given anything for the promise that it wouldn’t be my entire future. The view from my window is of the skyline of Boston; the CITGO sign lights up offensively bright shades of neon blue and red, and the blaring of absurdly loud car engines will sometimes startle me when I’m studying in my room. As a high schooler, I daydreamed of this often. Opening the window to my childhood bedroom usually meant little more than making the soft chirping of birds slightly more audible.

I am not from here. When I walk to Kendall Square, I inevitably spend some amount of time gawking at the height of the buildings. It feels strange to be in the center of a city when you’ve spent practically your entire life in a small town. I am very aware that I come from a place where the only thing you see when you look up is sky. And the place that I am from exists less and less. Empty plots and grazing fields are being replaced by modernist-apartment buildings. The proportion of streets in my town with watering ponds for livestock is dwindling, replaced by the distasteful urbanity of a Southern City- sterile storage units and cookie-cutter houses. 

There is something so old about yearning for days past. It implies that there is something to remember. I can’t tell how I feel about this. The narrative of “small town girl who’s trying to make it in the big city” is overused, but I’m most certainly trying to find my place and I’m not at all sure how to do it. 

While digging through my closet in search of a suitable shirt, I found a grass green notebook, a white, plaid pattern on the cover. This was one of many diaries; I wrote a lot as a child. I remember what it felt like, too – pencils were still hard to grip, and I was so frequently frustrated at my writing quality that I often tore out and threw away enough pages from individual notebooks to make them fall apart. I flipped through this one, which had the characteristic degraded spine, and found approximately what I expected – badly drawn horses and blatantly derivative fantasy stories abandoned halfway through their production. The daily entries were interesting, though. I’ve never been terribly interested in writing about what happened in my day (life was very boring for a very long time), so I did a lot of meditative writing. I would never presume to call it anything near mature, but it is reminiscent of what I am like today (also, probably, not particularly mature).

The hallway to my bedroom had a mirror which I helped my father screw in with a power drill. I remember standing in front of it when I was small, wondering if I would be happier about who I saw in the mirror when I was older. I wondered if I would be smart, or funny, or less shy, or pretty. I’m nearly 20, and I feel very bad for this version of myself, who had somehow at such a young age internalized that she would forever be insufficient. It frightens me a little that this was such a through line in my consciousness for so long. 

Growing up is strange, though, because at some point things that have always hurt begin to fade, and other things begin to ache. I like myself much more now than I ever have before. I feel lost, but not, really, internally. I have been able to resolve many of my questions about who I am and what I care about, but I do not know where I belong.

I often feel as though I am looking for safety and comfort and rest, but have difficulty finding any of them. I wish I were five years old again and climbing into the arms of my mother would fix everything, but I wake up from nightmares in a cold sweat and I don’t even mention them to her the next day. I am too old for this now. 

There’s a fragment of something from somewhere about how “crying on public transport” is symptomatic of being in one’s early twenties. I have begun to feel viscerally alone, but not for lack of friends or socialization. This loneliness feels incurable, which is a terribly angsty line, but it certainly follows me around like a phantom. I’m not sure how to handle it, exactly. 

In grade school, I would always ask my parents to buy me jellybeans during Ramadan. I would stay up late talking to my friends, drinking Snapple Tea and guessing what flavor bean we had drawn from the bag based on its color. I still do this, almost ritualistically. I will buy a bag of jellybeans from the Walmart Neighborhood Market the day I land in Arkansas, pick up a friend, find a parking lot, and talk in the dark.

Many of the people from my childhood have stayed in Arkansas. It’s strange how little I feel that they’ve changed. These friendships are earnest and long-lived and uncomplicated; somehow everything feels simpler at home. People have an abundance of common sense and a lack of self-importance (one must wonder how I am from there, too).

This was the place that raised me, but when I moved to Boston, I was so excited. I wanted to get out of the South, away from the systems of my youth – college in the Northeast was a promised land. I wonder if I ought to have grieved more for what I was leaving behind. The inky darkness of a chilly summer evening, punctured by lazily fluorescing fireflies. Earthworms on the sidewalk after a thunderstorm. My father’s earnest joy to see me. The smattering of stars in the night sky. Chalk on the sidewalk, and glowsticks which I insisted on cutting open out of curiosity. Jumping off of too-high rocks knowing full-well it was a bad idea. The bookshelf which I grew up on – Asimov, Austen, Tolstoy, Dickens. 

Somehow these experiences feel as if they are gone. While making lunch one afternoon, I realized that my eyes were tearing up as I chopped an onion. I had assumed this was something I had simply grown out of, but here I was, squinting my eyes as they watered, feeling all the strange awareness that comes with any flavor of pain. I felt very human. My allergies are better in Boston. The sun is less hot. Onions don’t burn my eyes.

The flight back was quiet. I was childishly excited to see my friends again, but I still hadn’t found what I was looking for, at least not in any permanent way. The feeling of belonging is often fleeting, but I had felt it, even if I could already feel it fading.",,0
it’s getting colder and i’m getting older,Audrey C. '24,5,2023-11-03T00:00:00-04:00,"As if someone flipped a switch, this year’s unnaturally warm autumn has abruptly given way to winter. It’s the cold air stinging my airway, how it’s always dark out after my last class of the day, that tells me autumn has already breathed its dying breaths. 

I’m an 
        MEng
      
 student now. People have told me that “being an MEng student is literally the chillest thing ever.” For the most part, that’s a stinking load of BS. I still feel like I never have enough time for all the things I want to do. 

In a way, things do feel a bit lighter though. I’m only taking two classes (WGS.245: Queer Literature & 2.737 Mechatronics) instead of my usual four or five. My other academic commitments are to work on my research and to 
        TA
      
 a class, both of which I’m really enjoying. I’m busy, but I finally have room to breathe. 

Or maybe, I’m finally carving out the space to breathe. Being in nature has been sooo good for me this past summer, so I’ve been trying to frolic in the Great Outdoors whenever I can. 

- I spent a weekend at the WildFire Flow Arts Retreat and learned how to 
        flesh,
      
 
        breathe,
      
 and 
        spin
      
 fire 
        safely
      
 in the middle of nowhere Connecticut. In my mind, Connecticut has always been the liminal space between Boston and NYC. Now I associate Connecticut with fire loving hippies and friendship and community. 

- Dormcon organized an apple picking trip and of course I had to go. I don’t even love apples. They’re just okay. It’s really all for the opportunity to frolic amongst fruit bearing trees and partake in what’s probably the most stereotypical New England fall activity. Winnie, Tiffany and I bought matching fruit beanies (strawberry, blueberry, orange respectively) off of Depop specifically for the occasion so that we could be fruits picking fruits. 

- In general, I’ve been trying to get my butt outside if I’m feeling down. Even if I don’t have the time or energy to go somewhere that’s actually naturey, walking to Star Market or biking down the Southwest Corridor lifts my mood. 

—🍂🍂🍂—

Living off campus has also created a much needed layer of separation from MIT. That’s also made it easier to breathe. 

I really miss East Campus though. The activation energy needed to hang out with my friends has increased tenfold. I can’t just bump into them on the way to the kitchen or head down a flight of stairs to check if they’re around. I miss the “it’s 3am but I’m hungry,” the “so am I,” and finally the “haha what if we made noodles and banana bread?” 

Now I have to message my friends and remember to message them back and Google Calendar a time to meet up. I am genuinely bad at remembering to message people back within one business day. I miss having most of my friends at an arm’s reach.  

It’s always a great time when I do catch up with them though, whether due to meticulously planning GCal events or serendipity. Our conversations tend to circle around the terrifying prospect of becoming old by undergrad standards. 

I feel like I’ve become … domestic. My life is so quiet nowadays. 

Right? Like I’m no longer the spontaneous spring chicken that I once was. I go to bed by midnight and wake up early to take advantage of the daylight. I mealprep. Dude, I’m so boring.

Maybe we’re just prioritizing taking care of ourselves more. 

Maybe we’re just growing up. 

Growing up and being not boring are obviously not mutually exclusive, but there’s a clear trend amongst my friends and I towards craving a stability of some sorts, both in the present and the future. We talk about our immediate post grad plans and longer term goals and loftiest dreams. Our conversations are grounded with a newfound sense of self assuredness. Our words seem lighter. 

We’ve wrestled with feeling lost and uncertain throughout much of our time here at MIT, but we’ve all emerged with something to look forward to. There’s still a ton I don’t have the answers for, like whether to stay at MIT for a PhD, how to convince other people to take me more seriously in workplace environments, how to sound confident when I only know a medium amount of something, versus needing to know a lot about something before I can speak definitely about it…

We may not have it all figured out yet, but we’re definitely figuring it out. And that’s what matters. 

—🍂🍂🍂—

I caught up with my past UROP mentors recently, both of whom have moved on from MIT. It’s always nice catching up with old mentors, as kind of a reminder that there are extremely cool people out there who care deeply about my growth. 

My relationship with my new advisor and my new lab is pretty good, I have a lot of freedom to work on things that excite me, and I’m really enjoying TA’ing even though the idea of receiving student evaluations is so nervewracking and haunts me daily. But explaining something wrong isn’t the end all be all, and I’m TA’ing to help students learn, not to boost my evaluations… 

Wow, sounds like things are going great!

I get caught up in the small stuff sometimes, but I suddenly realize that the things that matter are actually going well!

I had worked on characterizing the inner workings of generative image models in my past UROP, essentially making complicated AI models less of a black box. This was before stable diffusion and GenAI became the hottest buzzwords of the tech world. One of my mentors talked about diverging from image models and moving onto large language models as his primary research focus. 

Well, I’m also doing something different. Lately I’ve been designing the hardware and mechanical parts of diagnostic devices that my lab wants to build. We’re trying to make that stuff more accessible to smaller clinics and other healthcare settings with fewer resources. Also one of our postdocs builds optical systems and I’m hoping to pick up some of that from her. 

I breathe in. 

Anyways I don’t do much deep learning nowadays. Sorry, I guess I really veered off the track.

Audrey, you didn’t veer off the track, this is your track! This is the stuff that makes the world a better place.

I breathe out. I’m grateful for my mentor telling me that. 

It’s been simultaneously forever and a heartbeat ago that my friends and I started MIT on zoom during the cursed fall of 2020, and now we’re seniors. Even if this winter is cold and bitter, something in the air tells me that there will be enough heartwarming moments to get me through it. It’s also the last winter before my friends and I disperse. We’ll be leaves drifting out into the world, carried by winds blowing in multiple directions.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_8390-e1698994028460.jpg

★★★★☆,Allison E. '27,1,2023-11-03T00:00:00-04:00,"A couple weeks ago, my dorm (Burton-Conner) got an email from 
        the front desk
      
 beseeching us to pick up our packages:

Hi all, The stacks of packages are reaching NBA-player height, so if you’ve received an email from BC Desk (that isn’t this one) notifying you of a package delivery please come and pick it up! Also if you’re expecting a package and haven’t gotten an email yet please be patient – we’re going as fast as we can. Thanks, Ekanem BC Front Desk

Hi all,

The stacks of packages are reaching NBA-player height, so if you’ve received an email from BC Desk (that isn’t this one) notifying you of a package delivery please come and pick it up!

Also if you’re expecting a package and haven’t gotten an email yet please be patient – we’re going as fast as we can.

Thanks,

Ekanem BC Front Desk

The next day a second email arrived: “Guys it’s for real nearing Shaq height.”

As the latest beneficiary of Amazon’s six-month free Student Prime trial, I would like to offer a personal apology to the BC front desk (and also mother nature) for being majorly Part Of The Problem. Going to college 5,000 miles away from home meant I had to pack everything I could into two suitcases, so I spent my first month at MIT transforming my garbage bag laundry hamper, travel toiletry bag, and just-sheets-no-blanket-no-pillow bed into a more long-term living situation. Which has meant… a few too many Amazon packages.

In ordering these many Amazon packages, I’ve also ended up wasting investing many, many hours online shopping conducting thorough reviews of all potential products and their corresponding sales. But dorm supplies are fun, and I feel like some of my overthinking actually paid off. Thus, in order to bring further use to my many hours of intensive research, I hereby invite you to partake in this multi-course meal: a curated selection of my room’s most compelling ornaments, all prepared in the style of the 5-star review.

 


        Appetizer 1
      
: Hangers



I like fashion, so at home my closet is filled pretty tightly with clothes, and these “velvet” hangers do a great job of conserving space. They’re a little more work to hang/remove clothes on than slippery plastic ones, but I figured that I’d need them in a small college dorm. They also swivel at the hook (which means you can hang them on random items, like my dresser door!) and have a looped design that you can hang pants on. Unfortunately, however, despite my two suitcases being packed solid, I still have so many fewer clothes than before, and the BC closets are also quite large, so I don’t actually need the space-saving function. More importantly, these hangers also shed black lint all over my clothes??

2.5/5 stars

 

Appetizer 2: Shower Caddy



There are little cubbyholes in the BC bathrooms where you can store some of your toiletries, but you still need something to bring with you into the shower. This one is nice—it has holes on all sides (including the bottom!!) and little feet to elevate the caddy & let water drain. There’s no dividers, which means it’s easier to fit lots of stuff, and also it was cheap :D

5/5 stars

 

Main Course 1: Clip-On Reading Light



This is my desk lamp, and since my desk and bed are right next to each other, it’s also my bed lamp! Saves a bunch of desk space as well. To be honest, I don’t really use it that much (everyone in my room stays up pretty late, and almost everything I do is digital & on a lit-up screen anyways), but it does serve its purpose admirably. Now that I have a little hidey-hole underneath my bed, it’s also very useful for cave studying/knitting/chilling.

4.5/5 stars

 

Main Course 2: Keyboard



I’m so proud of finding this one—it took hours, but I finally unearthed a keyboard that can connect to my iPad & laptop simultaneously, meaning I can basically use them dual-monitor style! This keyboard also has really low-profile keys, which is vital for me because I’ve spent six years typing on the lowest profile keyboard ever, and anything different cuts my typing speed in half 😭

5/5 stars

 

Main Course 3: Lunch Bag



So uh… I bought this because in high school I brought leftovers to school for lunch most days, and I figured I’d try doing that in college as well—only now with a more roomy and aesthetic vehicle. Aspirations of meal prepping! Cute little tupperwares! All my favorite snacks! In what should have been a predictable chain of events, however, I am just. Too lazy. In fact, I have yet to even touch this lunch bag… Ah, well… At least it was a cheap mistake.

2/5 stars

 

Main Course 4: Bedside Storage Caddy



The beds in BC can be raised pretty high, but I raised mine even higher because… while I may not have much horizontal floor space, vertical space is completely free! Now that it’s elevated, I can squat comfortably under my bed :D! The one downside is that I need a place to stick my phone and nightstand-esque items, so I got this hook-on caddy that does the job. It feels a bit papery and low quality, and it hangs a little weird given BC’s bed frame shape, but it’s alright 🤷🏻♀️

3.5/5 stars

 

Dessert 1: USB-C charging cables



Half my cords are broken, all of them are too short, and I like to use my phone in bed (don’t tell my doctor 🫣). Apparently, however, I have a terrible sense for distances, because when they arrived, I was appalled at how 16 feet was, in fact, a lot of feet. More concerningly, I now had three of these things. Did I need three? Probably not. But they were on sale for $4 each, so now I use one in bed, one for out-and-about, and gave one to a friend. And over the last month, I’ve actually needed those 16 feet at least half the time I plug something in. Most importantly, I will never have to worry about my cable being too short ever again. 

5/5 stars

 

Dessert 2: Blue Tape

My beloved <3

Ah yes… blue painter’s tape, the best thing to have ever been invented, full stop. I could go on about this tape forever—it’s incredibly easy to tear, sticks to almost anything, leaves no residue, and is even reusable for several stickings. I worship at the feet of blue tape, and I’ve kept this stuff in my backpack 24/7 for years because tape comes in handy more often than you think. Absolute no brainer of a purchase, I highly recommend.

5/5 stars

 

Dessert 3: Rug



My roommates and I preemptively gave up on making our room a shoes-off zone (too many friends/other people come in and out for us maintain it), so we’ve resigned ourselves to a dirty floor. The main problem is that I love lying on the ground—at home I did a good 40% of my homework and 90% of my YouTube watching sprawled out on the carpet. I’ve really been missing that, so I managed to move my bookcase on top of my drawers under my bed (this literally fits w/ ZERO leeway) and shove this rug next to it. It’s thin, and kinda more ugly than I expected, but for an $18 price tag and the chance to lie on the ground again, I’ll take it :D

4/5 stars

 


        Dessert 4
      
: Comforter

I put this comforter inside a duvet cover, and also I’m too lazy to make my bed for you guys, so here’s a stock photo :D

The moment that winter temperatures hit 70˚F at home, people at my high school would start bringing full-sized blankets to school with them. The absolute coldest it ever gets is 65˚F, so when we started hitting THE FORTIES in September, I quickly realized that I’d need to level up my blanket game. This comforter arrived a week later, on October 3rd at 3:09 pm. The temperature was 82˚F.

Welp… so much for needing a comforter. At least it’s double-sided! More color combinations!! I put it inside a duvet cover (so that I only have to wash the thin cover regularly), but still. Colors!! The weather has also cooled back down very rapidly, and it’s so poofy and exciting and warm. Feels like being in a hotel :D

5.5/5 stars (for comedic timing)

Overall Rating of My Amazon Purchases

Most were good decisions, some less so, but mainly I’m just glad that I’m no longer living out of suitcases. My room feels a little bit less like summer camp, and a little bit more like home, and I think that’s partly because I’ve had so much control over what goes into it. So yay!

"Guest blog: “Me, Marvel, and MIT”",Chris Peterson SM '13,0,2023-11-02T00:00:00-04:00,"Today I’m hosting a guest post by Jade Durham ’25, who — alongside Cami ’23 and Shayna ’23 —  spent the last few years working on a UROP that I supervised about MIT in the Marvel Multiverse. Jade just published an article about her research findings in Technology Review. It’s really good and you should go read it. If you want to learn more about what went into the making of an article like this, and what it’s like to do a SHASS UROP at MIT, read on below!

Phase 1: Being a Marvel Fan & an MIT Student I have been a big fan of Marvel ever since 2016. I get pretty hyper-fixated on things, and Marvel was an extensive enough franchise that my little gremlin brain was endlessly fascinated by it. I dragged my family to see the movies and collected lots of Marvel knick-knacks. When I applied to MIT, I even wrote about a pair of Spider-Man Shoes I had painted in high school. Spider-Man Shoes, featured in my MIT college application! When I got to MIT, I found out there were a lot of nerds here. (Who knew?) Some snippets of Marvel things I did in my first semester: [*] saw filming of Wakanda Forever right on Mass Ave during REX 2021, after watching Iron Man on the lawn of McCormick Hall [*] saw Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings with my friends in a Cambridge theater [*] dragged my neighbors to see Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage in a Fenway theater [*] dressed up as Scarlet Witch for Halloween [*] saw Spider-Man: No Way Home in Boston! (I had just finished finals week, gotten a flu shot, and had a flight home the next morning, so it was truly a fever dream of an experience, but totally worth it to see those MIT references in a Boston theater) Marvel filming Wakanda Forever on Mass Ave (on the eve of the penultimate EC REX party before its 2023-24 renovation) MIT was a great place for me to embrace my interests with others who seemed to be just as invested, which was pretty nice! But I wanted to develop my professional skills more and get some working experience. Phase 2: Combining MIT & Marvel in a cool way: UROP! To set the scene: It was my first IAP. I was on campus. I was taking 18.02a and 8.01L. I was cooking for myself and trying to figure out what to do with myself for the upcoming semester and summer. As I stalked the ELX website for spring research opportunities, I stumbled upon an entry for a Comparative Media Studies/Writing UROP that looked like a perfect match for my obsessive fangirl brain: 
        MIT in the Marvel Multiverse.
      
 Needless to say, I was pretty interested in this opportunity. It was the first UROP I had seen that I felt I had any qualification for, considering I had years of Marvel knowledge v.s. only 1 semester of MIT GIRs under my belt. I immediately drafted and sent an email to the supervisor: Petey, aka Director of Special Projects at MIT Admissions + Student Financial Services. It’s funny looking back on this email now. Back then, I was considering a major in 
        Chemical Engineering
      
Course 10, but now I am majoring in mechanical engineering (thanks to 2.00B). What were my qualifications for MIT in the Marvel Multiverse research? Watching Studio Ghibli video essays and getting in the top 1% of Joe Hisaishi listeners for my 2021 Spotify Wrapped. I even included the name of my favorite restaurant (Chik-fil-A) in the first line of my email “to demonstrate that I have read and understood this entire listing.” After sending that email, 
        I didn’t hear back from Petey for a while.
      
 I decided to do some digging on my own, because now I was DETERMINED to have this research opportunity. I had remembered seeing a mention of the Marvel UROP in one of the blogs written by Cami ‘23. So I reached out on Discord and sent a few more emails, eventually getting confirmation that there was no space for a new UROP in the spring semester. Completely understandable. However, it was likely that the research would need someone to continue it over the summer. So after a whirlwind Freshman Spring Semester™ of planning 18 events for McCormick CPW 2022 and 
        taking classes that would define my sophomore year and beyond,
      
 I secured UROP funding for remote summer research for MIT in the Marvel Multiverse. Phase 3: Profit! (… over a little bit more time than I expected 😅) So, I got to spend a pretty cool summer delving into Marvel! When I returned home for the summer, I planned out how I would conduct my research for the project. Fortunately, I had a solid base of research to work off, thanks to the previous UROPs: Shayna ‘23 and the aforementioned Cami ‘23. They had compiled a thorough spreadsheet of several references from their search. I picked up where they left off, watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe on Disney+, reading comics on Marvel Unlimited, and checking out materials from my local library system. My strategy varied from chronologically reading the stories of notable MIT-affiliated characters, to scouring the internet for potential new trails to follow. For each reference, I made a new entry in the spreadsheet and described how MIT was portrayed and its accuracy to the real thing. After meeting frequently with Petey over the summer, in August of 2022 we met with Deborah Douglas and Alice Dragoon (the MIT Museum Director of Collections & Curator, Science & Technology and the senior editor of MIT News at MIT Technology Review, respectively). We discussed the possibility of publishing an article, discussing my findings and tying it back to the origins of MIT becoming synonymous with technological genius. I was eager to take this on, and it sounded like it would be possible to publish my feature near the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which would certainly highlight the MIT/Marvel connection! However – I definitely bit off more than I could chew for my sophomore fall. I joined new clubs, worked with a second UROP, and took on a TA role; and this was all on top of some pretty intense foundational MechE classes! I’ll be honest, the firehose was hitting pretty hard that semester, and I didn’t think I would be able to meet the initial deadline we had set. I had drafted several outlines by this point, and synthesizing the sheer amount of information I had collected into a single article was more taxing than I expected. Fortunately, my supervisors were completely understanding, telling me to prioritize my studies and working with me to reschedule the deadlines. I knew that my IAP and Spring terms were also looking incredibly busy, so we agreed to push my writing time until the following summer. Fast forwarding to the end of my sophomore year, I decided to stay in Cambridge for summer 2023. I would be working on a more technical UROP at MIT Sea Grant while keeping the remote SHASS UROP position to continue researching Marvel and MIT and developing the MIT News article. Writing the article was a fun way to spend my evenings, while I kept up with work, friends, and cooking for myself. I had set a hard goal of completing the article before the summer ended, since I didn’t know when I would get another concentrated period of time that I could commit to the Marvel UROP. I will be honest and say that the brunt of the writing happened last August, as I felt the summer slipping away and REX 2023 revving up. So after submitting several versions for review and fact-checking, in September we finally got an article that we were all happy with. And now the issue is out! The MIT News article, “Superhero U,” is now published online! reflecting on a shass urop So in review: this project has spanned over a year of my life, and about half of my total MIT experience. In this blog, I framed my work pretty positively, but that doesn’t mean that it was all smooth sailing. Most of the time, I was constantly worried that I wasn’t doing enough, that I wasn’t a good enough writer, or that I should be working up my technical skills instead. But in return, I learned a lot about myself and how I approach self-managed projects. And with the incredible support of my mentors, friends, and family, I was able to prioritize my life and academics as an MIT student. I would have never expected to have an opportunity like this, especially not at a technical institute like MIT. But what makes MIT amazing is that research projects can be driven by a student’s passion and energy to explore their interests. And sharing my passion for the intersection of MIT and Marvel with the wider MIT community was certainly a great experience I will always be happy to have.

november again,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",3,2023-11-01T00:00:00-04:00,"we’re halfway through the semester.

november always feels like the point where the new-semester excitement wears off. there’s something about novembers that make you remember, something in the sudden, bitter cold.

i walked to campus today and let the mid-fall breeze bite at my face. i could see my breath misting in front of me. when i looked up at the sky, it was bright but unforgiving.

i’ve been wearing a lot of red, sort of against my will. i keep insisting that i’m in my cool color era, my green and white and blue era, but i’m shuttled back to red every time. i tried to dye a blue streak in my hair but it came out grayish-green, so i dyed over it with red and of course, that’s refused to wash out for the past month. i crocheted a red scarf for myself earlier this year, and my fall coat is red, and all my coziest sweaters and flannels are red, and i painted my nails red before i went out for halloween, and i keep meaning to get more green-blue clothes but i somehow never find the time to go thrifting.

i don’t really know what that means.

maybe it just means you look good in red.

yeah, maybe. some change would be nice, though. i don’t know. my pinterest boards look very different from how i dress these days.

something about always trying to reinvent myself but not being committed enough to change myself.

it sucks when you put it like that.

sorry. i think i’m a lot happier than last november, or two or three novembers ago, though.

things are fine. things are fine most of the time. i think i’m just really bad at managing unexpected stress. something goes wrong and i go haywire.

well, i think you’re doing great. i mean, you really like your classes this semester, don’t you?

yeah, they’re fun. you know when all the topics in your classes line up, and it’s like wait, i’ve heard about that somewhere else, and you feel like that guy in front of the bulletin board?

the guy from always sunny?

yeah, that guy.



lmao

lmao

but yeah, like — in 
        7.003
      
 we’re studying yeast, right? and sometimes yeast stuff gets brought up in 
        7.06
      
, and sometimes transport stuff from 7.06 gets brought up in 
        7.20
      
, because y’know, the human body is all about transport. sending things here and there and metabolizing things.

it’s those moments of synchronicity that make me feel like i know what i’m doing. i’m far enough into my courses to be taking all bio classes for this to happen. but at the same time i’m just frustrated that it took me this long to figure it out. y’know? i’m in my senior fall and i kind of sort of have it together but i don’t have enough time to do anything about it, because i’m graduating next semester.

like, if i knew what i know now, i would’ve made different choices.

what do you mean?


i would never want to relive high school again, but i wish i’d just…i don’t know, taken more ases, or taken a class earlier, or not taken a class at all. or whatever. or checked my audit more often in sophomore year. and reached out to my advisors more. and participated in all the cool programs available here. like misti. i’ve never applied to misti. i don’t know.

dude, no one knows what they’re doing when they first get here. unless you’ve done like, thousands of hours of research on everything mit-related, but i feel like that usually turns out to be naive froshy energy. and people change their minds all the time.


yeah.

hey, remember at the beginning of this semester when i kept getting mistaken for a frosh because i had a certain joie de vivre when interacting with people?

yeah, that was pretty funny lmao


didn’t last long though. i think that was mostly just because i was happy to see my friends again after the summer.

and when i see frosh interact, part of me is a little jealous, because how do they have so much energy?????? i feel so old and creaky. being a tired jaded senior comes for us all.

i don’t think you’re jaded, necessarily. i think you’ve just found a social balance that works for you and you mind your own business more. nothing wrong with that. protecting your peace, if you will. froshy energy is something precious but it doesn’t have to last forever.


also, you’re not old. you’re twenty one. you’re like, a three-year-old adult.

true. but don’t you ever think about the connections we could’ve made with people if we’d tried a little harder?

i meeaaaaan. sometimes you just stop clicking with certain people and that’s fine. it’s fine to outgrow people. isn’t that something you learned a long time ago? like, isn’t that what you spent a huge chunk of time working past in therapy? and it’s not like you don’t put a lot of effort into your current friendships and connections. i can tell they really mean a lot to you.


more like in the past two years, but yeah. you’re right, sorry. it’s not really that big of a deal, honestly, i think i’m just moody and reflective because i know that daylight savings is coming soon.

extra hour of sleep!

yeah, but at what cost? 4 pm sunsets are seriously so depressing…

yeah true lol

that’s why taking vitamin D is important

i know i have it somewhere, i just have to look for it.

ugh

UUuuuUUUUUGHHHHHH

u good


yeah, i’m fine. there’s just so much to do alllll the time.

but you know what? i think i’ll be alright.

you can do it! and i mean that genuinely. i hope you know that. you’re capable of waaaaay more than you think you are. i mean, every time you have a breakdown over something stressful, you still manage to pick yourself up and learn from what happened. you said earlier that you’re not committed enough to changing yourself. i don’t think that’s true. you’re really earnest about wanting to be better, whatever “better” means. you’re doing a really good job. these things take time.

thank you.

and thanks for talking with me, by the way.

of course. i’m you. i’m always here.

tim’s wardrobe,Waly N. '24,2,2023-11-01T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m going to pretend I have not been AWOL. Life updates shall come in another blog, so for now, let us get on with the content.

Each class year at MIT has an elected student council, which plans events, creates merch, and does general stuff for the class. I, for some reason, ran my first year and have been on my year’s class council since. It has been, for the most part, a good time, but sometimes it can be a bit tiring. Some weeks, there is a lot of work to do and at times, people (students and real adults) can be hard to deal with, especially since it is tricky to satisfy everyone in a class of over 1000 students o__o. Despite the lows, it does feel fulfilling when people say they enjoyed an event we spent months working on :)

On Class Council, we tend to have a signature event each Fall and send out an email to our class informing them about logistics, tickets, and whatnot. We could have made the email a basic FAQ type of email, but we wanted it to have a little bit more charm. A little more spice to it.

So, back in sophomore year, I thought it would be cool to create a rendition of TIM the Beaver for our signature class event, Twenty Fourmal. It seemed like a fun side thing for me to do and also a way to promote the event. I wound up drawing an extremely formal, posh TIM the beaver. Our event vibes were more semi-formal than super-formal-tuxedo-3-piece-suit-energy, but he seemed fitting, especially with his monocle. For some reason, the quality of the photo got absolutely murdered, so believe me when I say it definitely looked better at some point in time.



We started off the email to our class with…

“TIM the Beaver sat at his desk, looking at all of the MIT classes, waiting for one that would cause a spark in his eyes. Then came a class, a class like none he had seen before. The Class of 2024. Upon realizing he had yet to meet the class at an in-person signature event, TIM let out a soft ‘Dam’ and knew he had to meet such a distinguished group. He headed to his desk, and started to pen a letter…”

I also drew TIM wearing a black dress, but we winded up just using a monocle, a top hat, 1800s-era TIM instead.



After doing it once, I drew another TIM the following year for Oceantation, an event we had at the New England Aquarium. Normally, classes have a first-year orientation event at the Aquarium but… COVID. I had recently watched Aquaman on a plane, so I could only think of Jason Momoa for inspiration.



This year, we held our last signature event, which was Disorientation. It’s a tradition for seniors to return to the place where they went for orientation for a night of 
        fun
      
 and dancing. Typically, this place is the New England Aquarium, but we for reasons held it at the Museum of Science instead. Someone on class council had the idea that all the members should wear dino onesies to the event for recognizability, so TIM also was wearing a onesie. I meant to make it the same color as the ones we wore, but I didn’t get the chance to.



To make these designs, I played around a bit with Adobe Illustrator. I first removed 
        TIM’s shirt
      
 to create a simple TIM template I could use to create designs. This means I basically had to strip TIM down to a cursed, naked state. After being mentally scarred, I gave TIM some new drip that fit each event. Luckily, this TIM did not have to go through licensing because I may or may not have violated a design rule….



But we’ll ignore that. To be fair, I never did change the graphic on his shirt, I removed the shirt to begin with. His outfit was not only respected but actually upgraded, case closed.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unnamed-400x476.png

A Week in the Life of a Student-Athlete,Emiko P. '25,8,2023-10-31T00:00:00-04:00,"What up, squad!! It’s been quite the week for MIT Women’s soccer.

The season is flying by, and we’ve played a whopping total of 18 games — 4 of which were the past week. I’m going to take you along for the journey of that week, and what it’s like to have both a mix of soccer and school.

Monday

My team had our Concept Presentation for 2.76, Global Engineering! At the beginning of this semester, we were given a problem, a corporate partner, and a $5,000 budget. My team’s problem was to figure out how to improve the litter removal process from highways. After a ton of market analysis, 
        user research,
      
 and concept generation, we gave a presentation to our class on our selected idea and how we would move forward. 

Right after that, I went straight to the bus for our first game of this week — an away game at Lesley. I’ve figured out that I basically won’t be able to play this season because of my fractured and sprained foot, which is such a bummer because I was very much so looking forward to this season. However, I still try to make it to every game and most of the practices to support my team in any way possible (which usually means I just go around the team huddle megging people). 

We really popped off at the Lesley game, though, with a solid 
        6-1 DUB.
      
 Although it was frigid, sitting squished between my teammates with our huge puffer jackets on and passing around a bag of Nerds Gummy Clusters made me feel warm that night. Also, we got Chipotle burritos for the bus ride home. Shout out Coach Martin!

Tuesday

For my class D-Lab: Design for Scale, we had to get welding trained in order to complete a lab where we build a steel jig and make 20 clothing hangers on it. My teammate Remi and I went together, and we were taught how to wear the proper gear, weld pieces of steel together, and use the angle grinder. The sparks flew directly at my face, and it was kind of what I would imagine the fire bending from Avatar the Last Airbender to be like. 

At practice today, we did a juggling challenge, passing drill, and some positional play working on building plays from defense to offense. After that, we did an activity with our team’s sports psychologist, who is a grad student from Boston University and works with us for the entire season. We broke into little groups, were given limits on how much we could communicate, and were then tasked to form a human star. It was way more challenging than it seems, so it ended up with many of us splayed out on the damp grass in weird positions and laughing ourselves sick.



Wednesday

Today we had an away game against Babson. It was a tough 2-1 loss, especially because we were on an 8 game win streak and they are the first team we’ve lost to in our conference. Despite the unfortunate L, I gotta say, watching us fight tooth and nail made me insanely proud. I’m happy to be part of a team that never gives up.

Also, I got some good news today… Remember how I mentioned that I had fractured and sprained my foot on the second (second!!!) day of the season? Well, after 8 weeks of clunking around in a big ol’ boot, it’s finally off, and I am walking around FREE!! If you see anyone walking down the Infinite beaming with joy, there’s a 95% chance it’s probably me.

Big ol’ boot in question. She will not be missed.

Thursday

Busyyy day! We lifted in our Varsity Weight Room and got SWOLE. I still can’t lift legs because of my foot, but you better believe I’ve been benching like crazy. Since getting injured, I’ve lowkey entered beast mode and my noodle arms have been growing by the day. Also, us juniors are responsible for getting ready for senior day this weekend, so we decided to laser engrave some glasses with their favorite phrase: “me shoot!” We went to open hours at Metropolis, a maker space for MIT students, and thanks to the help of the mentors there, we walked out an hour later with 7 engraved glasses.

Friday

Went to Pappalardo in the morning with two other juniors and, with the help of 
        Bill,
      
made more senior day gifts. We waterjetted cool keychains with all of the seniors’ jersey numbers on them! Later that day, Remi and I finally welded the jig and made our 20 coat hangers on it.

That night, all the soccer juniors decorated for senior day. We listened to music, blew up so many balloons we all got lightheaded, ate pizza that was DoorDashed by Ashley’s grandma from North Carolina, hung streamers from the ceiling, and made sure everything was perfect for our lovely sens.

Saturday

Senior day woohooo!! We gave our sens the best gift of all: a 4-0 W against WPI. After the game, we gave them even more gifts and had a Chipotle tailgate with everyone’s families. That night, we drove 3 hours to Maine for an overnight and all piled into a hotel. We had a game the next day, so the junior class and I had a chill 
        PowerPoint night.
      
 Also, today was the day that I learned that most people say “punch buggy” and not “slug bug” when they see a Volkswagen Beetle. Sorry if that’s random — I’m still processing this info. Let me know if you guys are as shocked as I am.

Sunday

Rise and shine! Game versus Colby! Unfortunately, we took another L today. Somehow, 2 out of our 3 total losses this season happened this week, and it’s definitely my fault because I was 
        writing a blog about it.
      
 

Fall vibes.

It was fun to celebrate our seniors this week, road trip through New England as the leaves were changing color, and flex my 
        Course 2 
      
muscles a bit. As we head towards the end of the regular season and into postseason, where every game might be our last, I’m glad we got to create these little wholesome memories along the way <3","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/78EC2E7E-8C0B-443C-AAB3-DB6D4049BA6B_1_105_c.jpeg

requiem for the desert,Amber V. '24,0,2023-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,"Written early September after a presentation by Spencer Glendon from Probable Futures.

I am from the desert.

I was once enamoured by green trees but now I am aware of the sameness of everywhere, the unique beauty of a mountain range of saguaros. Sah-wah-rows.

I am from Arizona, which means it’s my job to step in whenever someone complains of the heat and say, “You’ve seen nothing, sweet winter child. You’ve never tasted true heat.”

Rillito River bed

I stand by that but I hope they never will, up here. They don’t seem to like where the heat is at already — for the past three days people have been complaining. I grew so convinced it was hot that I expected the faucet water to be lukewarm when I asked for cold, the way it gets in Arizona in summer. I expected the wet towel in my room to dry overnight. It is not yet close to the summers I’m used to, the August I used to run in. But it’s getting closer, and each uptick in temperature is unnerving.

I went to a presentation yesterday. It was meant to shock CEOs into caring, to make them worry over how their businesses would crumble if the bedrock of our society came crumbling down. I was less shocked, and less concerned about the market, but one part stuck out to me: the presenter said, the climate you know isn’t your climate anymore. But the climate you’ll have to experience henceforth used to be somebody else’s. Learn from them.

He talked about putting shade over benches and closing windows to keep out the heat. I mean — obviously. In Arizona it’s hostile architecture to not have shade over bus stop benches, everyone knows that.

But I am from the desert. This is the sort of learning he’s talking about.

To be fair, it’s worse to have heat waves here because the city isn’t built for it. My dorm, Burton Connor, has no AC, and outlaws window ACs, the more affordable kind. Buildings are insulted to keep heat in, not let it out. 

But — where does my climate go? My desert, already on the edge of what is survivable? Do we plant our cacti where there used to be forests?  

It’s hard to go back home without feeling a certain anxiety. The Tucson I know fights capitalism and every time I come home, I make a pilgrimage to each coffee shop I love, wondering as I do if it will be the last time. Chain stores have started opening across the street from them, one by one. I don’t buy from those stores, even in Boston. 

I run by the river, drinking in the landscape. Our sunsets are the most beautiful I know. 

Last time I went back I realized I needed to appreciate the desert’s hardiness. That Tucson had been Tucson for longer than I was around. The desert survived; that’s what it evolved to do. It kept on after I was gone.

And yet.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PXL_20230526_015422804.MP_-400x300.jpg

How many MIT students does it take to figure out how to rotate a cube?,Andi Q. '25,3,2023-10-29T00:00:00-04:00,"“@Andi you know how with ultra hand you can rotate objects in 45 degree increments?” 
        my friend Fatema
      
 asked me over Discord one day, “how many unique [orientations] can you make?”

I was, for better or worse, all too familiar with this “ultra hand”. You see, I’d spent way too much of my free time last summer holed up in my room playing the new Legend of Zelda game instead of exploring New York City like a normal college student. For those of you who 
        haven’t played the game yet
      
, Ultrahand is one of the many new abilities our hero Link gains in his quest to defeat Ganondorf. At a high level, it allows him to lift, rotate, and fuse objects telekinetically.



Although this ability seems rather mundane at first glance, it allows the player to build some really crazy contraptions – from amphibious vehicles for traversing Hyrule to full-on attack drones that mow down hordes of enemies in seconds. And the fact that you can build functional mechanical computers in this game fills my engineering heart with so much joy.

Yet despite all the hours I’d sunk into the game, I’d never really thought about how the ability works beneath the hood. I mean, it’s just moving and rotating things around, right? I move objects around all the time – how complicated can it get?

It gets quite complicated indeed

First, let’s talk about how the game handles rotations… or rather, how I initially thought it handled them. When using Ultrahand, you can rotate an object around two axes of rotation – left-right and up-down, each in 45-degree increments. To describe an object’s orientation, you needed just two things – the direction it faces and the relative rotation angle around that direction.

(Imagine this was in 3D)

Sounds pretty straightforward, right? In fact, if rotations were in 90-degree increments instead, this model would accurately answer Fatema’s question – 6 directions (one for each face of a cube) times 4 relative rotation angles for 24 total unique orientations.

So I figured there were… maybe 64 independent directions (a factor of 8 from each axis)… times the 8 relative rotation angles for each direction… but also divided by 2 because we double count some orientations, which gives us…

“256,” I guessed, “final answer.”

Satisfied, I closed Discord and returned to my psets. Another day, another video game mystery answered with the infallible power of mathematics. MatPat would surely be proud. But no sooner had I picked up my pencil than I heard a notification ping from my laptop. Looking up, I saw that Fatema had replied with a link to a 2017 Mathematics Stack Exchange post.

“It says here that there are actually infinitely many orientations,” she objected.

My calculations had failed me! But why?

Linear algebra to the… rescue?

TL;DR, rotations in 3D are weird because linear algebra is weird. Suppose you rotated a cube 45 degrees up→down→right→left. Where does it face after those rotations?



It faces the same way it started, intuitively because up→down and right→left rotations cancel each other out. But what if you rotated it 45 degrees up→right→down→left?



Uh-oh, it faces a slightly different direction now. So what happened, and why don’t the rotations cancel each other out anymore? To explain this discrepancy, we need to talk a bit about linear algebra.

A common way to describe a rotation in 3D is with a matrix – a 3×3 grid of numbers you can multiply with a direction (specified by a list of 3 numbers) to get another direction. A sequence of rotations is then equivalent to multiplying the corresponding rotation matrices in order.



It turns out that unlike multiplying numbers (where the order of multiplication doesn’t matter), 
        matrix multiplication does (usually) depend on the order of multiplication
      
! And this key difference is why our cube faces a different direction when we change the order of rotations.

The Stack Exchange post that Fatema sent goes even further and proves that rotating the cube up→right→up→right→… (by 45 degrees each time) will never return it to its original orientation. Each intermediate orientation is unique, so there are infinitely many unique orientations. (In fact, it’s possible to achieve any possible orientation in 3D using up, right, down, and left rotations by 45 degrees! But in true MIT fashion, I leave the proof as an exercise to the reader.)

So there you go – a mathematical proof that rotations by 45 degrees should yield infinitely many unique orientations. Case closed; nothing more to see here.

… yet despite having this evidence in front of us, the result still didn’t sit well with Fatema or me. We’d spent enough time playing the game to know we didn’t have to rotate each object hundreds of times to achieve the desired orientation. There must be something else going on here! But where do you turn to when linear algebra fails you?

Crystallography to the rescue!

Admittedly, this problem stumped us for a while. We tried a few other things, like using lines of latitude/longitude, but those didn’t work either. Then one day, while doing my 
        3.033
      
 pset, I had an idea – materials scientists deal a lot with crystals and their rotations in 3D, so maybe one of them knows how to solve this problem. Coincidentally, 
        one of my good friends is a TA for 3.010
      
 – the Course 3 (materials science and engineering) crystallography class.

“Hey Maria,” I messaged her, “you know how with ultra hand you can…”

A few minutes after describing the problem and our approaches thus far, I received a response:

“Isn’t this just crystallographic directions?”

I was slightly skeptical that the solution was that simple, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. For context, materials scientists use integer triples to describe directions inside crystals; Maria was referring to the 26 directions consisting of only ±1s and 0s.

The 26 possible crystallographic directions

This model perfectly described what I was used to seeing in-game – high symmetry and a discrete set of orientations. The key difference from my original model is that rotations are no longer done strictly in 45-degree increments, which was completely unexpected for me.

To verify this hypothesis, Fatema and I set up a little in-game experiment where we tried to see if a sequence of up→right→up→right→… rotations would bring an object back to its original orientation. And indeed, it did!

So in total, there are 26 possible directions and 8 relative rotation angles for each direction, giving us 208 unique orientations. Not too far off from, my original guess of 256, but it’s pretty remarkable how this relatively small difference arose from such a profound misunderstanding of how the system works!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/totk-ultra-hand.gif

It’s dark and raining slightly, the only light on the Harvard Bridge coming from the streetlights and the Boston skyline. The Charles River drops off under the bridge, churning more than usual.

I am holding pallets of bright green, yellow, and purple paint with five other girls in my sorority. Further down the bridge is a group of older men wearing Lambda Alpha Chi shirts.

It’s time to continue the ancient MIT tradition of repainting the Smoots. 

But first, let’s rewind 65 years ago to when it all began. 

POV: it’s 1958

In the fall of 1958, a couple members of the MIT fraternity Lambda Alpha Chi were making the trek across the Harvard bridge from their house to MIT. The pledge trainer remarked how miserable it was walking across the nearly half-a-mile bridge all the way to MIT — that it was basically walking to hell. 

One night after a chapter meeting, they decided they were going to mark the distance of the bridge so they’d know exactly “how long it would take to get to misery.” The original plan of marking the distance with feet or yards morphed into a new plan that would introduce the most iconic unit of measurement to date: the Smoot.

This new unit of measurement was the height of the shortest pledge in the class — none other than 
        5’7” Olly Smoot
      
. Soon enough, the Harvard bridge had been measured at 364.4 Smoots ± 1 ear, and bright yellow, purple, and green (the fraternity’s colors) tick marks and labels appeared on the bridge. 

Twice a year, it was the responsibility of the newbies of Lambda Alpha Chi, the pledges, to repaint it. What started as a funny inside joke turned into a source of pride for not only the fraternity and MIT, but for all of Boston, and it was soon commemorated as a public landmark!!

The tradition has survived the complete teardown of the sidewalk, the pledge class of ‘92 getting hauled to jail by Boston police, and more…

POV: it’s 2023

Now, fast forward all the way from 1958 to 2023. How did I end up here on this bridge? Not even an hour earlier, I was minding my own business, desperately trying to Courseroad and reorganize my junior year, when I received the following mysterious text from a sophomore in my sorority, Alpha Phi.

 



Um, duh.

So at 10 pm, I scooter on over to the bridge. There are 15-ish people total, a mix of Aphis and older MIT alumni wearing Lambda Alpha Chi working their way down the left and right side of the bridge. 

Because of COVID, it’s been two years since the iconic numbers have been repainted. Despite the break, the long-graduated Lambda Alpha Chi members dive into the task with what can only be described as frat boy enthusiasm. I can’t help but get as hyped as them, and soon enough, a paint pallet is shoved into my hand and we are painting away. Faded numbers are redrawn purple and yellow, and the word ‘Smoot’ is repainted a dozen times in several disorienting patterns of color. 

As I wander further down the bridge, an older man wearing an LAC shirt suddenly swaps my yellow paint out for a brush dripping green onto the sidewalk. Looking down at the faded letters reading ‘Halfway to Hell,’ I ask him, “So, which letters do I paint green?”

He tells me, “Whichever ones you want!”

It’s an activity of passion more so than precision, and the paint drips and splatters, and some of the letters admittedly end up funkily drawn, but it all somehow adds to the thrill.

I get to talk to the members about their time at MIT. One was a 
        Course 4
      
 from the Class of 1990 who started working in the financial trading industry and developed a super sick formula to trade derivatives in foreign currency. Another Course 4 from the Class of 1981 now owns his own architecture firm. There was also a fellow 
        Course 2
      
 from the Class of 1983 who started his own trading company. 

It was so interesting to learn from the original creators about the Smoot lore — something I have heard so much about at MIT. (Also it was just plain exhilarating to run around the bridge vandalizing painting) It’s cool how MIT traditions keep drawing us back to campus long after we’ve graduated. From now on, I hope that if you walk on the bridge and see the Smoots looking fresh and taken care of, you think of Lambda Alpha Chi dutifully painting them year after year. It’s moments like these where, even though we make fun of MIT for its rigor and IHTFP nature, we know in our heart of hearts that there is nowhere else we’d rather spend our four years.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1958.10.00.Smoot-Marks-Done-1-2.jpg

I failed the Swim Test!,Kayode D. '27,5,2023-10-26T00:00:00-04:00,"Obligatory Swim Test Lore: 

The MIT Swim Test was created in the 1940s after a high volume of drowning-related deaths at war. It’s been around since then, and despite many non-swimmers’ grievances, the test will continue for the foreseeable future. 

The idea of the test is that if you ever fall into the Charles River that borders MIT campus, you can swim to one of the shores. The river is 200 yards wide, so you would need to swim 100 yards. That’s the 
        length of a football field!
      
 You are required to swim 4 laps in the pool without stopping, with 3 exclusively facedown and the last one optionally faceup. You also get a t-shirt for showing up!

In 2020, when the world shut down and MIT went virtual, the swim test went virtual as well. If you were a Senior that hadn’t completed the swim requirement yet, you could take a 4 hour course in substitution for the swim test. This is the only instance I could find of the swim test not being required.

If you take the PE Courses of Fencing, Archery, Sailing, and Pistol/Rifle, you can get an Official 
        MIT Pirating Certificate
      
. However, to take the sailing class, you need to pass the additional boat test, which requires you to tread water for FIVE MINUTES. I can’t even swim, let alone tread water! Oh well, maybe one day…

I’ll be the first to say it: 

The swim test is dumb.

I can’t swim. When I was little, I took swim classes at the community pool, which worked well. But then I got older, and I got tall. 

I’m 6’ 4”. I can touch the bottom of every pool I get into. I haven’t been in a pool deep enough for me to have to swim since I was, like, 8.

So when I found out that MIT had a mandatory swim test, I was kinda frustrated. I knew I had to train beforehand, but I didn’t have easy access to a pool that was deep enough that I would be forced to actually swim and not put my feet down. My friends worked at a pool, and I know that I had every opportunity to learn, but I was too busy applying to be a blogger to learn to swim (you’re welcome). 

The day after I got to campus, literally on day two, I had to report to the pool for the swim test. At least I wasn’t in the worst boat—some kids didn’t even know there was a swim test. I anxiously waited and took the swim test, and of course I failed; I don’t know how to swim. I got two and a half laps in when I realized that learning to actually swim was probably better than inching through this and never learning and drowning in the river someday. 

So I climbed out of the pool and my legs were literally shaking. Y’all, swimming is hard. I took the walk of shame to the table and signed up for a swim class…  

AND IT WAS AWESOME:

I thought swim class would be lame, but y’all, I could not have been more wrong. If you can’t swim or you’re unsure if you can pass, please consider just signing up for a swim class. Not only do you get to skip the line of people attempting the test to sign up for a class, you get whatever time you want, guaranteed, and it’ll fit our schedule. 

My instructors were really chill. I had the Cross Country Coach and Softball Coach as instructors and they made the class great. They looked at everyone’s skill levels and taught us in groups accordingly.

We spent the first portions of classes doing a thing called mindful walks in the 3-4 foot pool. We had to walk from one side of the pool to the other—not swim, walk. We had to think about how the water felt, the resistance, all of that jazz. It felt weird. No matter how hard I tried to walk faster, I couldn’t get traction or move any faster than the water would let me. I had time that I could spend doing nothing but thinking. 

This reminded me about The Erosion of Deep Literacy, and this study I recently read which asked people to sit in a room with a shocker and nothing but their thoughts for 15 minutes, and most people chose to give themselves 
        unpleasant electric shocks
      
 than sit alone with nothing to do. MIT moves so fast, and having times like this to actively slow down became a highlight of my days. 

I learned how to frontstroke! And backstroke! And crawl! And tread water! – Treading water is hard, especially in a pool that’s only four feet deep. Long story short: I learned to swim! I also met some great people, like a guy from Colorado who I do 8.01 Psets with [well, used to, before I dropped to 8.01L because I’m bad at physics.], and a dude with really cool pineapple crocs.

Last week was the last session for the swimming class this 
        quarter
      
, and at the end of class, the instructors asked who wanted to try the swim test. I didn’t think I could do it, but wanted to give it a shot anyway. I jumped in the freezing deep pool and started swimming, and before I knew it, I had done it! I had passed the swim test!

As I came out of the water, completing the core conflict established in episode one, I took off my tinted goggles and saw the world in a new, more nostalgic way. I realized that this was the last episode of my swimming training arc saga. All the conflict had been resolved, and all the loose ends had been tied up. I could swim now, and wouldn’t die in the river. I could hear a song playing in my head like a credit theme to end the episode. Our instructors called us out of the pool, and we all got into the smaller pool we started the class in. We took one last victory lap before all going our separate ways. This was the finale.

MIT has been a whirlwind of new things. It feels like behind every challenge is another bigger one, and it just gets more challenging. Even applying here seemed like an insurmountable task. I know some people are now finishing applications for early action, so I want to say good job. It’s a lot, I know. I remember very clearly how draining the whole process felt. I know I can’t really equate learning to swim to applying to college, but to whoever is reading this, for what it’s worth, good job in accomplishing the little things. I feel like a different, slightly more athletic person than I was before, and now I can tackle my next challenge: 

Ballroom Dancing.

and i’d do it again,Paige B. '24,3,2023-10-25T00:00:00-04:00,"song: that funny feeling covered phoebe bridgers, by bo burnham

every saturday or sunday my freshman fall, i’d go over to have dinner with my friends and their family.

every saturday or sunday my freshman fall—i can no longer remember which—my problem set for 18.701 (algebra I) was due.

—

i signed up for 18.701 because it was the right thing for me to do. at least that’s what everyone told me, and so that’s what i believed. at that point, i completed the introductory math courses i needed to take, and i knew what courses i wanted to eventually take, and so 18.701 became a way for me to start learning pure mathematics to the degree that i needed to learn it. and i had satisfied the prerequisites, and i had spent that summer trying to prepare my proof writing skills. i did everything right that i could do to prepare for this course. i told myself that i’d do it again.

in my preparation for this class, i read one of the problems in the first chapter, and i thought to myself “i can’t solve that.” and then i started taking the class. and i had to solve that problem. and i did. and this happened over and over again until one day i had completed the class. i did it.

there are moments where you can feel yourself growing as a person at mit: that problem you had no clue how to do suddenly is in your problem set, that topic you tried to independent study but were utterly confused, now makes sense. and at the end of every semester you’re just glad you made it to the end—but nonetheless you’ve made it—and now you have to make it again. 7 more times. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2.

—

there are moments where you have to make tradeoffs at mit.

that show you always watch every tuesday gets put on hold because your problem set is due, or you’re just too tired. that club you swore you’d join—that you desperately wanted to join—now conflicts with a class.

or, it’s saturday (or sunday), and you’re at your friend’s family’s place for dinner; except you’re not, because while everyone is hanging out downstairs, you have to hop on a zoom call to finish up the last few parts of this problem. it’ll be an hour at most. maybe 2. 3.

but it’s worth it, right? because now you’ve made it to the end. you’re a better person/mathematician/what have you now. and you’d do it again.

—

a week or so ago, my friends and i made apple cider and watched over the garden wall for those fall vibes. at the same time, my collaborators—friends—and i were wrapping up the first draft of a project we’ve been working on since this summer. and at one point, one of my collaborators asked if we could hop on a zoom call real quick to go through some final edits. while my friends are watching the adventures of wirt and greg, i was in my friend’s room on a zoom call working on these final edits.

and it’s nothing i hold against my collaborator—not at all—but when i hopped on the zoom call i felt such massive déjà vu back to my freshman year. off in some room in a house, while my friends are hanging out, and i’m taking a zoom call.

—

when i say i’d do it again, i mean it. if i hadn’t taken 18.701 that fall i wouldn’t have taken 18.702 (Algebra II) in the spring, or 18.102 in the spring, or 18.155 when i did, or—

where i would be right now in my life/my career/my education would be different. and that isn’t a bad thing. i like where i am at. i wouldn’t want to change that. but there are moments when you realize what parts of yourself you’ve sacrificed, or even worse you feel that you’re different and you don’t know how—and don’t know if—you want to change.

there are ways you can prevent these sacrifices. maybe you don’t need every point on this problem set; maybe it’s time for you to just go to bed and work on things tomorrow; maybe you should drop that class. these are easier said than done. these are lessons i’m just barely learning my senior year.

but even so. i’d do it again. Differently. maybe i have grown.",,0
Collections,"Ella T. '25, MEng '26",3,2023-10-23T00:00:00-04:00,"I think I should be blogging about the relevant and interesting things I have been doing both inside and outside the confines of MIT. I’ve reached this strange turning point in my life where I want to do things more than I want to talk about them, which was not how I thought about things when I came here. Everything seems more simple now? If that even makes sense. I don’t feel as concerned about anything. I don’t feel the pressure I once did. I don’t think as deeply about the opinions of the people around me, or even the opinions I have of others.

I am currently taking 9.36 (Neurobiology of Self) which is a class that focuses on the neural mechanisms of the self, in an autonomic sense, and how we might begin to attempt to separate our physical forms from our thinking forms, if there is even a difference. The professor starts each class with deep breathing (4 BPM). At first, I wasn’t buying into it. I’ve always considered myself a very thoughtful person, not in the sense that I have good thoughts, but because I am full of thoughts. The professor tells us to think less. She tells us to be present. She tells us to consider how our body feels before we consider how our mind is thinking. I hated all of this. But now I’m starting to get it.

My life is getting infinitely more complex. I have to think about applications and a mEng, my GPA and the quality of my research, teaching others what I have learned,  and being a vaguely older young adult than I once was. I have to maintain the relationships that matter in my life. My schoolwork is increasingly difficult. I have people to mentor. But despite all of this complexity, I think so much more simply than I once did. It is nice. I wish I figured it out sooner.

I’m not saying all of this to encourage anyone to let go of everything. I’m doing more than I ever have, whatever that means. It just gets easier. I don’t know. To anyone reading this, it gets lighter.

I will give you a short synopsis of everything I haven’t blogged about. I spent a week in New York City and two weeks traveling around Spain. I interned in Boston over the summer and learned a lot. I read a lot of books. I became obsessed with crosswords. I started doing research at MIT’s SuperUROP program in modeling human speech perception. I started spending significantly more time with the first-ever friend I made at MIT, which I think we both needed. I’m taking cool neuroscience and linguistics classes. I’m trying to organize my thoughts about whether or not my Bachelor’s will be the end of my educational journey. I’m growing my hair out. I’m applying to a lot of things and getting rejected by a lot of things. I’ve been dating the same person for a year now, which, in MIT terms, is a significant amount of time. I’m taking an acting class. I bought an air fryer. My suite is filled with freshmen, which has helped me take a step back often.

I don’t even know what the point of this blog is. I’ve been thinking a lot about thinking simply, which has reminded me about myself. If you know me in real life, you know I enjoy having very few possessions. Like very few. I’ve always been like that. But recently, I decided to round up a few small collections I have. It is pretty uninteresting. But I think you should look through them.

After all, they are simple.



A collection of rocks. I used to tumble rocks before I came to MIT, and I even wrote one of my sample blogs about tumbling rocks when I applied to be a blogger. I think that blog had some strange religious underpinnings. I hope it never sees the light. These are some of my favorites. 



Acoustics and phonetics textbooks. Somewhat for 24.915 (Acoustic Phonetics) and somewhat for my current research. I love phonetics and speech perception so much. I am so thankful to MIT for letting me do something so niche for such a massive amount of time. 



Rings. Every sterling silver ring you see here, besides my brass rat, was gifted to me by my late maternal grandmother. I feel closer to her now that she’s gone than I ever did when she was alive or dying. I miss her so much. She lived an incredible life. Sometimes I think she is somewhere watching me. Maybe not though.  The acrylic rings are from a flea market in Nashville. They are scratched up from when I used to writhe my fingers together in stress and anxiety my freshman year. I don’t do that anymore. It was never that deep. 



Creatures. I got these little rubber things from Blick, an art store in Central Square, after walking in the pouring rain. They know a lot of things, I think. 



Crib sheets, and one graded exam. These are things that MIT lets you take into an exam, sometimes. Most of these were for 9.35 (Perception) and 6.036 (Machine Learning). Both were fantastic classes that taught me a lot about myself. I don’t know why I keep them. This isn’t even all of them, the other ones were helplessly crumpled. 



Crochet hooks. I have been crocheting for a long time now, which you think would warrant me better hooks, but the majority of these are from a cheap kit that a friend got me for Secret Santa two years back. I feel like I can’t part with them. I hope they hold up forever. 



Cards and coins from Spain. Easily one of the best two weeks of my life. I am so thankful I got to leave America for the first time. I am also so thankful I had a Spanish speaker to cling to for the entire duration of the trip. I am also thankful that I could convince my boss to let me take two weeks off in the middle of my internship. Thanks, Mike.

close your eyes and put your finger on the map,Amber V. '24,0,2023-10-22T00:00:00-04:00,"disclaimer in case the title doesn’t show this, I am writing this blog to show that there *isn’t* a ‘best way’ to choose where to apply, and that even after going through the undergrad application cycle, applying is still scary and depends on a bunch of personal factors.

 

Several months back, I realized that I wasn’t “toying with going to grad school” anymore — I want to try for a master’s. I’d been playing with the concept since last summer, in Denmark, when I realized that every mechanical engineer in my company had a master’s degree or was studying for one. This was a sample size of 20, and master’s aren’t required by any means, but it seemed that having one would give me an edge, especially in Europe. As I enter my senior year, it feels like there’s still much more to learn, and there are many cool MechE classes I won’t be able to fit in to my undergrad. Talking to master’s students at MIT helped solidify that decision, and working in the 
        GEAR Lab
      
 last spring sealed the deal.

Since then, I’ve been applying willy-nilly to scholarships and grad programs, both domestically and 
        abroad.
      
 Some of the international scholarships in the UK would offer 2 years of funded study, and master’s programs in the UK are only 1 year, freeing up a second year to do more engineering, or energy policy — or creative writing. Like what! Like wow. Writing MAs and MFAs come with a hefty price tag, and are never something I planned on. Getting funded for one would be fantastic, the sort of dream you never dare to dream.

The only question is where. I know a bit about domestic mechanical engineering graduate schools, just from talking to people, but I know so little about the programs in meche, much less writing, in Europe. So this was my process of figuring out where to apply.

I should note that these scholarships all have pretty low acceptance rates, and I’ll also be applying to schools in the States later on, so there’s less riding on these ones. For me, since master’s are only 1-2 years and happen at a much less formative period of life than undergrad, there’s less stress around applying in general.

 

So I started where any reasonable person would — with the internet.



I used US News & World to see how the program was ranked.

Then I looked the program/school up online and see what people on forums are saying. I personally use forums as a litmus for how the school is perceived — is it seen as being more stem-focused or humanities-focused, etc. Remember, everything you read on the internet is true. 

Then I thought about if I’ve heard of the program before. This is kind of like forums in that it is actually the most accurate and verifiable method.

I asked people who might know about said school — grad students or upperclassmen in the field, and friends who have studied or lived in the countries I’m looking at. 

I went to the school’s website and looked into the descriptions, requirements, and especially course lists of the program I’m applying for. MSc’s and MA’s in Europe tend to have course lists, so you can see more or less exactly what classes you’d take. Do they look appealing? Is this the area of study I’m interested in? Specifically on the MSc side, I was often choosing between schools/programs that offer “MechE with a climate focus” vs “Climate from a MechE background,” which boils down to how many classes are pure meche versus how many are applied to climate tech. 

Next I looked at the labs. This can be harder because the best tech schools in their respective countries tend to have the 
        worst websites.
      
 However, if you click enough links, you may find labs that seem appealing within your area of study. Or you may not. If you don’t, maybe they don’t exist. (But maybe they are just hiding, so talk to people who might know). My interests in clean tech are pretty broad, so I was fortunate to find labs breaking ground in topics I was excited to work on in most of the schools I looked at. A friend of mine is applying for grad schools in a more specific area of study, and he tends to look with more discernment.

Finally, I looked for other insights into student life — like admissions blogs!

When I was in high school, I followed most of these —  I remember that I went to the course requirements and decided MechE had way too many requirements and I would definitely not choose it. When I went to the blogs, I thought “everyone is very stressed all the time. If I choose this school I will also be stressed all the time.” But I applied anyway because I liked science.

When I went to the blogs, I thought “everyone is very stressed all the time. If I choose this school I will also be stressed all the time.” But I applied anyway because I liked science. 

And honestly? My instincts were correct. I was able to get a pulse of campus culture from reading the blogs, and I love much of our culture, our unbridled passion. I am stressed all the time, although the bite of it has faded, looming deadlines rarely faze me, and my main complaint is deep exhaustion. All the MechE requirements have stopped me from taking some amazing classes — although some of those requirements made me a better engineer. The question, then, is how much of this I want to repeat.

What locations make sense for me? Do I need cities, or sunlight?

me experiencing the one singular warm day in Edinburgh, where there is a university

I come from a small-ish city, Tucson, AZ, which has a lovely community with a unique and vibrant culture. Everyone doesn’t know everyone, but you get to know 

 Now I’m in a big city. I don’t go out into Boston as much as I expected I would in high school, but I do go into the city every 1-2 weeks; and even when I don’t, the presence of the city around us helps break the college bubble.

Boston is much more international than Tucson; hearing languages and accents from all over the world is common now. I have my complaints about Boston public transit, but everything is overall more walkable than back home; and after a few winters here, I’ve gotten more accustomed to walking even when it’s 
        cold.
      
 There is a rush to Boston, a sense that everyone around you is also on the grind.

biking back from Brookline (Boston suburb) in the rain!

I feel a certain FOMO about not being in a city when I’m young, as if I’ll miss out on something important. I’m questioning that a bit — there is value in slowness, in focusing in on yourself instead of always looking without.

There are other perks to being in a big city. If a weekend rolls around and my friends and I haven’t made plans, we can always find events to go to, some of which are pretty cheap. And the events are full of cool people. Just walking outside, it seems that there are so many young people that I could befriend, if only both of us had time and availability.

wet rats

So for all these reasons I chose to prioritize universities within cities, even though sometimes, the ‘better’ program was in a less densely populated area. For example there’s a well-known creative writing MA/MFA that’s in a teeny tiny town in southern England, a few hours’ drive from 
        London.
      
 The program looked good, and being in a place without too much outside stimuli would likely help me focus on writing. But I walked on Google Maps up and down the roads, found the town’s bookstores and coffee shops and Mexican food joints, and realized I would feel stifled before too long. Maybe I’ll be ready for that someday. But not yet. 

I also weighed the choice of going somewhere cloudy, freezing, and rainy. As a Tucsonan, I’m miffed whenever I have to wear a jacket in summer. And then winter — running is so much harder when everything is icy and your breath fogs in front of you. For months everybody is trapped inside, bundled in sweaters and fluffy socks. I’m grateful that I can use IAP to escape somewhere warm.

ft soggy tourists

Given this, was applying for places that are equally cold, but without a month-long break, wise? Wouldn’t I be freezing all the time? Probably. I saw Edinburgh this summer — it’s so pretty, even though I got rained out the one time I tried to run. I ran through the rain and got to the top of a hill in a thunderstorm, surrounded by soggy tourists. I don’t think I could get used to that forever. But maybe I could handle it for just one year, so I applied to a program there.

Arthur’s Seat, Edinburgh. So pretty but so wet

Cities yes, sunlight no. In MechE, I prioritized the rigor/reputation of programs, but for writing, I prioritized location. All told, I applied for programs in four British cities, perhaps to be discussed further if one of them does not reject me. Let’s see how this goes. 

For Fulbright, I tried to apply for a master’s at a university near Paris, but I needed a letter of affiliation from them, and their MechE department ghosted me. I called them and they only spoke French. So I asked my French-speaking friend to call them, he did, and they said ‘we’ll transfer you’ and then dropped the call. Twice. After this I realized I wasn’t getting said letter and in a panic looked for other programs — something in Paris at a different school? Something in the UK, or a different country in Europe? I landed on applying for a program in another British city, weighing the chances of getting in — small, but not as small as some Fulbright programs — with everything listed above. 



Those apps were finally done as of last week. It’s a huge relief. Now I’m turning to American MechE programs, where I know the vibes somewhat better. I’m starting the whole cycle again, weighing a university within a city against one that’s an hour from a city, etc. In America there are schools in actually warm places, which is thrilling and tempting.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PXL_20230814_104425510-400x300.jpg

Noise and time,Uzay G. '26,3,2023-10-15T00:00:00-04:00,"On time and noise

I’ve been meaning to write a post recently about time and what I want this semester to be like. And then Gloria Z. ’26 wrote this post that I really enjoyed, and related to a lot.

Notably:

I remember being a freshman this time last year! It was all excitement and anxiety and joy, everything jumbled up together, all extreme highs and lows. Every little decision and activity felt monumental and life-changing; I had to go to that info session, I had to meet new people, I had to go on exciting College Adventures™. I had to slump over in the Maseeh 3 bathroom at 4AM and cry for no specific reason, traitor tears leaking through my fingers onto waxy floor tiles. It feels almost like a dream now. Nothing was what I expected, probably because I went in with no expectations at all. What I didn’t realize was that, in the process, I forgot to do things for myself, by myself, and with myself: going for a walk, decluttering my closet, playing a video game in my room. All the hangouts and trips and events last year were new and exhilarating, and I met so many wonderful people; yet, despite interacting with more people in a day than I would in a week of high school, I felt strange pangs of loneliness more often than ever. I wrestled with this sense of isolation and alienation a lot, particularly during first semester; part of it stemmed from trying to find the communities at MIT that I fit into, but another reason was that I never took time to just sit down; time for myself to think, to reset, to stop sprinting from class to club to friend to event and just exist for a while.

MIT is a very exciting place. For most of the things you’ll be interested in, you can find a lot of people doing things around it. For me, that’s been AI, mathematics/problem solving, literature & writing, teaching people stuff, random socials, east side culture, climbing, etc…

When I got to this place I was so excited, and rightfully so. I explored and spent time in different communities, getting the feel for different little pockets of the MIT landscape. And I stayed in some, and realized others weren’t for me or that I wouldn’t have time. I was in this chaotic bustle of discovery but also underneath it I was dealing with the pressure of intense workloads and the difficulty of transitioning to a new environment.

These conflicts meant that sometimes I didn’t have enough bandwidth to really engage with things. It’s easy to just see something and try to add it to your bag, but with everything, in a short sighted way. But in doing so, I was losing out on a lot of depth.

This semester I’ve been kind of naturally trying to incorporate more focus into my routine, something I had more of in high school. To me, this idea of focus also comes back to the idea of me time to be alone that Gloria is talking about. Having time to just think about an idea, read a book, look at the sky…

It’s also the first time at MIT I’ve had the space to do this, but even when I leave this time open for these type of activities, I feel like there’s this nebulous whirlpool of socials & activities & dormspammed events & talks that are all kind of relevant to my interests and I sort of just stare out and have to learn to say no, because doing all these things doesn’t give me peace.

That peace, for me, often comes from more silent moments and especially being in nature. I love the mountains back home but I suck at planning stuff and haven’t been exploring any nearby much. I went to the Harvard Arnold Arboretum though last month, and it was very peaceful and pretty :)

sweet tree

This flurry, and people doing stuff, is part of what makes MIT wonderful, but it sometimes feels like noise. This noise in the look of that acquaintance talking about this event going on, or the noise of the notification of a meeting or thing I have to go to, or even the noise of people outside when you for once go to sleep early enough to hear crowds chatting out your window on a Friday.

I feel sometimes like I want to recoil and stay a bit within myself so I can think more about what I want and what I’m learning. Because that noise is overwhelming, and it’s actually fine if you don’t do all those things. Most one off things won’t change your life, and change happens over large periods of time. I guess this is just learning that it’s okay to just be? I’ve never needed there to be a lot going on to keep myself busy, but the activity makes me feel this strain of possibilities and imagined becomings, but actually it’s fine and it’s just okay to be?

There’s this kind of beautiful property of the world where if you spend a lot of time doing something and actually trying you’ll just like generically have something to show for it and you’ll grow a lot? And then the argument for doing new exploratory things is to find those pursuits you want to dedicate time to, but sometimes you just need to dive into a pool and look at the depths?

Beyond that more self-sufficient stuff, I also want to spend more time with close friends and just chill, rather than partake in lots of socials. I’ve been realizing that I mostly just have a set of friends but never really had a “friend group” at MIT, instead seeing people one on one or in some like event context or living community, and maybe I want to change that, although I’m not sure how since my friends are kind of spread out.

This semester

Other than that abstract talk! What am I focusing on this semester?

Research

I’m getting more and more certain the thing I want to do after I graduate is research. Maybe I’ll change my mind about this, but I just really enjoy learning things and having lots of freedom, so it seems like a good setting. I’m doing a UROP in the Solar-Lezama lab on using library learning and program synthesis (generating programs that solve problems automatically) to create safer and more intrepretable agents. It’s going well but I want to put more time into it, especially since there’s a lot I need to learn for it.

Math!

I’m taking fun math classes this semester, 18.404 and 18.100B! The problem sets for both have been fun and they’re both classes where the time commitment is okay but if you spend more time you can really get a lot more out of it, which I like. I also want to study some type theory and stats on the side this semester, but we’ll see what I have time for (often not much!).

Poetry ~ words

I’m taking 21W.771, Advanced Poetry Workshop. It’s a great class, where I feel like I’ve been getting a better sense of what poetry is about and why I like it / how to write good poems. I also want to keep reading literature, and just finished Ficciones by Borges, which was very beautiful. I want to run a little reading group with people where we read pretty stories, but that’s in progress.

EECS

I’ve been taking 6.191 Computation Structures, which is quite cool but I need to spend more time because it’s somewhat at the bottom of my priority list. I also am taking 6.S898 Deep Learning, and although the lectures are nice because I’m getting a lot of exposure to the prof’s intuitions, the psets haven’t been the most useful because I think I’ve had exposure to the coding side more, although I would still recommend it to people.

Better ways to get around campus,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",5,2023-10-14T00:00:00-04:00,"I’m now in my third year at Next House, so the long walk to campus is nothing new. Usually I enjoy the walk, but when the weather sucks or I’m coming back from a long day, I wish I could move faster than my legs could carry me.

But sometimes, the Tech Shuttle is so far from the nearest stop that just walking to Next is the faster option. I have a skateboard, but it’s not as convenient as I think when I have to lug it around between classes. I don’t want to fork over cash for an electric scooter or a bike, neither do I want to pay for a Bluebike ride for an ~8 minute walk every time.

We as a society have settled for suboptimal modes of transportation, and this is a problem.

Alternative evolutions of the bicycle

I’ve actually seen someone ride a unicycle down Amherst Alley before. You can’t get any cooler than that.

Arms



Are you tired of walking? Did you skip arm day because you had to write up that pesky problem set in LaTeX? Are you bitter at Maseeh people for living so close to campus when you have to walk all the way back to Next House, even though the doctor said that more walking is going to prolong your ankle sprain?

Try arms! Give your legs a break and become friends with the next best pair of limbs on your body.

And if that gets boring, you can even use all four limbs at once!

Our own subway system

yeah i mean why not

If we can build roller coasters and put police cars on the Great Dome, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t build our own transit system. Plus, this is a good chance to extend the campus tunnel system to student residences.

Prehistoric animal



If there is one thing I learned from the Jurassic Park franchise, it’s that dinosaurs are so cool that there’s nothing wrong with bringing them back to life and riding a triceratops to class.

MIT is supposed to be full of science geniuses or whatever, right? If an MIT faculty member won the Nobel Prize like a week ago, then there’s gotta be someone here who knows how to resurrect dinosaurs.

C’mon, it would be cool.

There’s no reason for us to tether ourselves to the limits of our reality when we can reject the laws of physics and take advantage of the eldritch forces.

Walk Across Rhode Island,Amber V. '24,1,2023-10-14T00:00:00-04:00,"Last Sunday, some friends and I walked across the state of Rhode Island!

This idea originated last year, when my friend Xavier and some of his mates realized that states up in the North East aren’t all that wide. In fact, some states were so thin that one could cross them in a day. So they did!

I heard stories of the Walk when I met Xavier this summer; it sounded grueling and fairly painful. Apparently when they finished they swore to never do it again.

This time they rounded up some 40 people from MIT and Brown University to walk the Walk again.

I was super excited. I haven’t gone more than 20 miles in a day in… ah… I’m counting right now and it’s been fully several years. I was pretty sure I’d be fine, though, since I ran one unofficial marathon at the height of the pandemic (when I was at an athletic peak, letting running fill the place of so many other activities).

Our trek began the night before, on Saturday, when we came down to crash at Brown. The students at Brown found us all nice couches in inconspicuous locations. Mine was right next to an elevator, so I got to hear students coming back home every 15 minutes or so, talking about philosophy or economics and generally sounding pretty composed and sober. 
        This
      
 went on until around 2am.

During this time photographer friend Brenna got some cool photos of me posing like one of your French girls in baggy pajamas. Then we eventually slept for like 2 hours before we all had to wake up before dawn to pile onto the bus!

The bus was late by like an hour so it was proper dawn by the time we started driving.

The bus! Ft Charm ’25

We disembarked at the border of Rhode Island and Connecticut, and started walking back toward Massachusetts. The journey would be 30 miles.



We walked to a trail.



We walked and we walked.

I downed a Monster but that didn’t quite cancel out the 2 hours of sleep. I had wanted to take a break from work for a while and this was the perfect opportunity: there was nothing but a faint buzz within my brain. My arms and legs were lifted with taurine, L-carnitine, caffeine. But everyone around me was awake and cracking jokes. Spirits were high. Charm, like me, is from Arizona, and one or the other of us kept bringing up the desert.

After 8 miles the trail ended and we walked beside a small and quiet highway. It occurred to me that I ran 8 miles earlier this week and my legs hurt less after running than they did walking. But I was mainly here to hang out, not put all 30 miles behind me as fast as I could.

We walked. The cars were enormous and well kept. I didn’t expect to see so many F-250 Fords so far from Arizona.

We walked some more. The cars were loud, kept interrupting our conversations.

We walked. I drifted between different people, often walking with Charm, met Xavier’s twin Eli and an econ major from Brown. The students from Brown were talking about philosophy and econ, biology and math, meanwhile we from MIT mentioned nothing more technical than the number of miles we still had to walk. Everyone started talking about being tired, but willing to carry on. Seven or eight miles slid by, and suddenly we were halfway!

We stopped on the side of a very steep hill, opposite a lake. It was beautiful. A couple of us rolled down the hill and the world has never spun so fast.

After some stretching and staring at the great blue sky, we began the Walk again. Brenna and I took some photos — mostly she did, of the lake and the road and of me walking along a wall.



We fell behind the group with fellow walker Tañon. The three of us used the restroom at a church in the middle of nowhere. The group was getting far ahead, and all of our energy slowly draining.

What if I run to catch them? I thought. See how far they’ve gone, urge them to wait. This was absolutely unnecessary, blessed as we are by the magic of mobile technology. But I wanted to see what running felt like after I’d walked 18 miles.

So I left Brenna and Tañon and started running. We each had a map, so I knew the route. I also knew we’d stop for lunch around Mile 20. My brain was filled no longer with a faint buzz but rather a fairly loud buzz and very little else, and perhaps this is why I jogged about a mile before realizing I should have caught up to the group by then.

I paused and checked the map. Wow, I thought, we’d fallen really far behind. I’d better catch the group before they stop for 
        lunch.
      


So I kept running. I watched the mile fractions tick away on Strava until I’d run another mile. By then I realized I had messed up and texted the group. As it turns out, they’d taken a left turn off the path and stopped for lunch!

Yay! Where was lunch?

1.6 miles behind me.

When I was running forward I’d felt that I could run forever. I was so powerful. A proper Amazon. But then I turned around, and suddenly running 1.6 miles seemed nigh impossible.

If I walked, though, they’d be done with lunch by the time I arrived and I’d be making them wait. So I ran.

I arrived slightly giddy because for the first time all day I’d be eating not month-old granola bars from target but real actual food. It was from Subway which meant it tasted exactly the same as it always does: good and slightly like plastic. But my granola bars tasted almost entirely like plastic so this was actually an upgrade. Plus food after walking a lot is god’s greatest gift to man.

There was a cute independent coffee shop in the same parking lot, so I got coffee on the way.

Brenna and Tañon had already arrived. I caught up with everyone — the updates were mostly a new body part aching. Xavier warned me that the next ten miles would be the worst.



After a break, we began the Walk again. This time we split into groups; two groups of the students from Brown went ahead, and one went behind us. Our MIT cohort largely stayed together, with Matt up ahead setting the pace.

We were out of the woods now, and out of the highways, and into the suburbs. This meant ample bathrooms and food options if we needed. You could feel the landscape changing and somehow noticing the change, the miles put behind you, made them seem longer and harder.

we found this waterfall in a parking lot behind a church. A man was filming a music video

Around mile 22 my left calf cramped up (right as we stopped to take pictures of the waterfall above). It was pain beyond pain, my very soul wrenched from my body, et cetera, et cetera.

We had good momentum, so I didn’t ask to stop. Besides, if we did, starting would only be that much harder. So we kept walking, crossing through a Hispanic enclave for several miles. I haven’t seen so much Spanish on storefronts in America since I was home.



The Walk began to feel surreal. We’d been going for eight or nine hours by now. The sun had been bright all day, and I was likely at this point dehydrated. The morning felt ages and ages away.



welcome to providence

We were still talking but all of our energy was lagging. Xavier found a sign for screened loam and started carrying it with us. Someone queued a country song about (I think) murder.

Finally we crossed into Providence! Sunset was finally upon us, and the changing daylight alerted me that time was passing and made things somewhat less surreal. We seemed to be walking in slow motion. Providence was still three or four miles from the Massachusetts border.

We crossed a beautiful bridge.

We stopped at a park three miles from the border, where the students from Brown were waiting. Full dark had set in.

As we were leaving, I ducked into a hip new-age bar to use the restroom, telling the group not to wait up for me. The bar had a catered event with free pizza, and it was a mark of how focused I was on crossing the border that I did not stop to steal any food.

A friend from the forge texted me asking how the Walk was going, and what my favorite type of hammer was. I tried to remember if straight peen or cross peen was better and what the diagonal peen one was called. Would I have stronger opinions on blacksmithing if I had more 
        brainpower left?
      


When I left the bar, the group was out of sight. This was perfect. It meant I could run to catch them.

So I started running. My limbs felt like they were made of tofu jerky, stiff and liable to fall apart.

I ran across a bridge. And then down a street. We were in suburbs again, the sort that cling to a highway, where the highway is also the main street.

I caught the tail end of the group but didn’t want to stop running. So I went past them, and when I found MIT people I knew, I said, “Run with me!” They shook their heads. So I went asking down the line until I reached the frontmost group. There were two miles left. At the front, Thomas ’25 agreed to run one mile.

So we started running. Having a partner made me run faster. We talked for about 30 seconds and then lapsed to silence, stumbling across crosswalks and pounding down the sidewalk.

After about one mile, I checked Strava and asked Tom if he’d like to stop? “No, let’s finish it.”

So we did.

Down the highway, which was increasingly more highway-like and less of a street. We passed a sign reading “SEEKONK, MASSACHUSETTS,” but wanted to find the fabled ‘welcome to Massachusetts’ sign. However, such a thing did not exist. We ran past some other signs, about speed limits and lake repatriation, and to a stop light at a gas station; and there we stopped.

We did it!!!!

anticlimactic I tell you

I checked Strava. Thanks to my mishap around lunch I’d covered 33 miles.

I was so pleased. I started talking, words spilling everywhere now that I didn’t need to save my breath. I didn’t know I could do the trek. I didn’t know how hard it would be, and somehow both the difficulty and the ease of the journey surprised me. I wanted to do it again — someday.



We went back to the Seekonk, Massachusetts sign to cheer everyone on. Most of them did run the last several hundred meters.

the MIT cohort of Walkers

Afterwards we gathered around, took pictures. People noted that Rhode Island had a way better welcome sign. Then we started calling ubers and catching rides back to Providence. My group piled 6 people, including two who are 6’5″, into a tiny little car. We were all of us exhausted and delirious. The four miles we’d just walked in the last hour slipped by in 10 minutes.

Then we limped and shuffled onto the commuter rail and back to MIT.

This was so lovely. Next time we’ll do the Oklahoma panhandle. Or a narrow part of Connecticut. Or this Walk again, with some returning people and some new ones.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_5110-400x300.jpg

The morning of August 20th, I carted my things up to my room on the third floor, rearranged the two sets of closet/bed/desk, and halfheartedly unpacked t-shirts before going out for Korean food with friends. Immediately, the rush of MIT swept me up; from the 21st to 25th, I was an 
        FPOP
      
 counselor for the First-Year Arts Program alongside fellow bloggers Teresa J. ’26, Fatima A. ’25, and Jebby B. ’25 (full joint post on that coming soon). As quickly as the wave came, it was gone, and I was left to plod my way through a weird liminal 1.5 weeks during which I really had nothing in particular to do. Then, the start of school: countless syllabi, new Goodnotes folders, and fresh resolution to stay on top of everything.

I remember being a freshman this time last year! It was all excitement and anxiety and joy, everything jumbled up together, all extreme highs and lows. Every little decision and activity felt monumental and life-changing; I had to go to that info session, I had to meet new people, I had to go on exciting College Adventures™. I had to slump over in the Maseeh 3 bathroom at 4AM and cry for no specific reason, traitor tears leaking through my fingers onto waxy floor tiles. It feels almost like a dream now. Nothing was what I expected, probably because I went in with no expectations at all.

This time around, though, I find myself reveling in the stability. It’s strange realizing that I know things about this institution now, like when the cafe in 
        Hayden
      
 closes, or the best times to grab food from dining halls to avoid the post-class rushes, or where all the vending machines for face masks and CLIF bars are. I also know more things about myself now, like how I like my bed to be as close to the ground as possible, or that I’m a mid-day showerer (not morning nor night), or how to sense when my social battery is gasping and close to empty. They’re all little things, but they add up quickly.

So this blog is a collection of those observations: some things I learned freshman year about myself, some things I’m doing differently now, and some things I still need to figure out, slowly, but surely.

 

I’d forgotten to spend time with myself last year

And I explicitly say with, because I think there’s a difference between just being alone and intentionally spending time with myself. Last year, I quickly realized that it was possible to be around other people for almost every waking hour, whether I was “working” in the 
        stud
      
 for hours, eating dinner, walking to Target, or even going to the 
        Z
      
. In the beginning, I thought that this was amazing. If I was going to do something anyway or wanted to go to an event, why not invite someone else along—two is greater than one, right?

What I didn’t realize was that, in the process, I forgot to do things for myself, by myself, and with myself: going for a walk, decluttering my closet, playing a video game in my room. All the hangouts and trips and events last year were new and exhilarating, and I met so many wonderful people; yet, despite interacting with more people in a day than I would in a week of high school, I felt strange pangs of loneliness more often than ever. I wrestled with this sense of isolation and alienation a lot, particularly during first semester; part of it stemmed from trying to find the communities at MIT that I fit into, but another reason was that I never took time to just sit down; time for myself to think, to reset, to stop sprinting from class to club to friend to event and just exist for a while.

a drawing I made last December about feeling drained all the time

Now, I’m learning to say no to social events without needing a particular reason, to realize when my social battery is running out, and to be intentional about spending time doing things alone, especially off-campus. Everyone is different and has varying levels of social stamina, but at least for me, I need those bits of alone time to truly feel like myself.

I love art!!!

I’m currently writing a separate post all about art and creativity and making things, but the TL;DR is that art is so cool (!!) and this semester, I want to produce more and better creative work than I did last year. To that end, I’m making commitments that will force me to make things regularly, including taking three art classes (
        4.301
      
, 
        4.341
      
, and 
        21M.601
      
) and leading a spread for 
        Infinite Magazine
      
.

maintaining friendships is hard

I feel like before, I didn’t have to think as consciously about my friendships. My high school friends and I were friends because we went to the same school for ten years; we had the same schedules and the same classes, and we ate lunch together every single day. Things are different here! Coming in, I had the same anxieties as everyone else about making friends and finding community. At least in the first semester, I found that it was actually pretty easy to meet new people—everyone was eager to introduce themselves, whether it was at an event, in class, or even in the elevator. However, the hard part was actually maintaining and deepening those friendships; if I didn’t share a class, club, or living group with someone, it was very possible that I wouldn’t see them for months on end. It was strange (and obvious in hindsight) realizing that I had to be more intentional about reaching out to people to hang out, and that the deeper connections weren’t just going to form themselves. But I think the extra thought required made it all more meaningful and worth it.

 

there actually, truly, is no right way to do things

alternate title: I can’t have everything :(

I think I’m always asking myself if I’m doing things right. I don’t know what right means, but somewhere in my brain there’s this idea that there is a correct way to do college (and life in general): a neat, orderly plan that considers all possible factors and spits out the optimal solution for fun, happiness, success, productivity, and fulfillment. It asks: is this the best way to spend my time? Should I be doing something else right now? How are other people approaching it? Am I doing it the way I should be?

When I got to MIT, I was told over and over again that everyone’s college experience is different, but I don’t think I really internalized that until this past summer, when I had time to reflect on my freshman year. It’s hard not to compare yourself to the best of everyone else; I want to be everything and do everything and have everything, whether it’s an impressive four-year 
        Courseroad
      
 or cool personal projects or a unique personal style or a packed social calendar. There’s this feeling that if it is possible, it should be done, and that with the right concoction of Google Calendar, sleep deprivation, and #grindset, anything is possible. And for some people, maybe that’s true! I don’t think it’s bad to be ambitious. For me, however, this mentality manifested itself as overcommitment, neglect of my physical and mental health, and the constant feeling that I was treading frantic water, at risk of slipping under at any moment—all experiences that I think many of my classmates can relate to.

I’m learning this year how to make tradeoffs and sacrifices, and to hone in on fewer priorities; I know now that trying to do everything is just setting myself up for disappointment. Yet instead of feeling regret for all that I’m setting aside, I feel freer to focus more completely on what I am keeping, and not like I’m stretching myself in every direction. It’s a nice feeling :-).

 

in conclusion

I spent last year in constant oscillation between highs and lows; learning a lot, but always spinning about, in motion. Now, everything is a lot steadier; I have a clearer idea of what’s going on and what I’m doing, and how things may change in the future. So—lots to learn and work on, for sure, but I’ll take it all in stride, and I’m very excited for the rest of the semester!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asdfasdlkj-800x800.png

Nobel Prizes in your pocket,Andi Q. '25,5,2023-10-09T00:00:00-04:00,"Do you ever stop to think about how incredible computers are? I don’t just mean software innovations like generative AI or the internet. I’m talking about the hundreds of billions of silicon transistors that form the brain of your computer, each engineered and manufactured to near perfection. If you think about it, the CPU inside your computer is basically sand that we taught to add numbers (much, much better than humans can do)! And don’t even get me started on other things like displays, memory, and batteries  – all things necessary for the light from this paragraph to be hitting your eyeballs right now.

With the 2023 Nobel Prizes still fresh on everyone’s mind and today being National Nanotechnology Day, I wanted to take this opportunity to talk about a few Nobel-prize-winning discoveries (since the year 2000) that enable you to read this blog post.

Brilliant Displays of Science

Regardless of what display you’re using to read this blog post, it is almost certainly powered by one of the following three technologies with roots in the Nobel Prize in Chemistry or Physics. (Even if you’re using a CRT display for whatever reason, the 1905 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the invention of the cathode ray tube.)

QLED Displays

Suddenly she is in a magical, technicolour world

Suddenly she is in a magical, technicolour world

Last week, MIT’s Professor Moungi Bawendi won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in synthesizing quantum dots – nanoparticles so tiny that their size determines properties like the colour of light they emit.

Professor Bawendi with an array of his famous quantum dots. I’ve heard he’s a really nice guy (he actually teaches an undergrad class about synthesizing quantum dots!), so I’m super happy for him :)

In my opinion, this year’s prize was one of the coolest Chemistry Nobel Prizes yet. Not only does the discovery involve pretty colours (always a plus in my books), but the prize was awarded to an MIT professor just a few days after I learned how quantum dots work in my 
        Course 3
      
 condensed matter physics class. They’re a neat demonstration of quantum mechanical effects and already have several commercial applications!

The most prevalent commercial application of quantum dots is in Samsung’s QLED (quantum LED) displays. Although the word “quantum” is synonymous with “we needed a science word to make our thing sound more impressive” these days (thanks, Marvel), “quantum LED” really does describe how these displays work! The exceptionally pure light that quantum dots emit makes them ideal candidates for modern display technologies.

Beyond display technologies, quantum dots have a bright future (pun intended) ahead of them. From more efficient solar cells to quantum computing, the opportunities for these miraculous nanoparticles to improve our lives seem endless!

OLED Displays

How can plastic become conductive?

How can plastic become conductive?

In materials science, “conductive polymer” is somewhat of an oxymoron. Polymers are almost always insulators (i.e. they do not conduct electricity) because they’re held together by covalent bonds, which don’t allow electrons to move around easily.

Yet by introducing small amounts of foreign substances (known as “dopants”) like lithium or iodine, certain polymers see dramatic increases in their conductivities while maintaining their processibility and flexibility. In addition to conducting electricity, they can become transparent and emit light under a voltage. The discovery of these amazing materials, which are light and flexible like plastics but can conduct electricity like metals and semiconductors, was awarded the 2000 Chemistry Nobel Prize.

This serendipitous combination of electrical and optical properties has led to conductive polymers being used in OLED (organic LED) displays and flexible phone screens. Ever wonder why your phone’s touchscreen isn’t a mess of criss-crossing copper wires? You’ve got conductive polymers to thank for that.

Wow, look at all these conductive polymers! I have no idea why these ones specifically are conductive, but they sure are fun to look at.

Blue LEDs

Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th century; the 21st century will be lit by LED lamps

Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th century; the 21st century will be lit by LED lamps

The 2014 Physics Nobel Prize was awarded for the invention of… blue LEDs. Yes, the same blue LEDs you can buy on Amazon for 7 cents each. You can find blue LEDs in any LED-powered light source that can emit white light (so pretty much every modern display), which goes against the idea that Physics Nobel Prizes are awarded for abstract, theoretical work with no significance for the general public. But the prevalence of these brilliant little devices shows just how important they are in today’s world.

Although the invention doesn’t seem super impressive by today’s standards (even undergrad students like me can probably fabricate a blue LED in a day), the first bright blue LED in the early 1990s marked one of, if not the most important breakthroughs in lighting technology. Red and green LEDs had existed for decades prior, but we could only shift away from wasteful incandescent light bulbs to energy-efficient LED lights thanks to the invention of the blue LED.

Masters of Light

On that note, let’s talk about two other important uses of light in computers – fiber optic communications and digital camera sensors, both of which won the 2009 Physics Nobel Prize.

Fiber Optics

The circulatory system that nourishes our communication society

The circulatory system that nourishes our communication society

The fiber optic cables carrying information around the world are probably directly responsible for you reading this blog post right now. They (quite literally) form the backbone of the internet, and for good reason too. They transmit information quickly and reliably over huge distances and are immune to the noise that often plagues electrical transmission lines. And they’re usually made out of 
        regular silica glass
      
 instead of some exotic material that’s difficult to manufacture.

At the very least, I wouldn’t have been able to publish this blog post without them (because then I would’ve had very slow WiFi, which would’ve made me rather sad).

Camera Sensors

A photographic camera for everyone

A photographic camera for everyone

Admittedly, the 2009 Physics Nobel Prize was for the invention of CCD (charge-coupled device) sensors instead of the more modern CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensors that most phone cameras use now. CCD technology uses the 
        photoelectric effect
      
 to sense the light hitting a massive array of pixels.

I still think it’s worth mentioning CCD sensors because they were the first commercially available, high-quality camera sensors and brought about the digital film revolution. And many modern DSLR cameras still use CCD sensors!

(Apparently, some people have strong opinions about which one of CCD and CMOS yields better image quality. I personally can’t tell the difference, but here’s a side-by-side comparison in case you can.)

Can you tell which picture was shot with CCD or CMOS? Because I can’t. (Seriously, I just pulled this picture from somewhere online and I don’t know which is which.)

Store and Release

These massive data streams would be practically useless if we couldn’t store stuff on your computer, be it retrievable information on a disk or power in a rechargeable battery. Luckily, there are also a few Nobel Prizes in those areas.

Magnetic Hard Drives

The whole world… in the pocket of each and everyone

The whole world… in the pocket of each and everyone

Magnetism is kind of like the misunderstood and unloved sibling of electricity. Sure, it’s fun to play with magnetic toys, but there aren’t many things magnetism can do in computers that electricity can’t do better. There also aren’t that many magnetic materials around, and it’s extremely difficult to apply them at the same scale as modern electronics. Everyone has heard of electrons and electronics, but there’s no such thing as magnons or magnonics!

Just kidding, 
        they do exist
      
. And the discovery of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) – a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a magnetic material’s electrical resistivity greatly depends on its magnetic state – won the 2007 Physics Nobel Prize.

The use of GMR in magnetic hard drives is widely regarded as one of the first major applications of nanotechnology and has ushered in an age of cheap and high-density data storage. Without it, we wouldn’t have laptops or any modern machine learning applications, which require massive amounts of data to be effective.

Although magnetic hard drives are slowly being phased out in favour of faster and more reliable 
        solid-state flash memory
      
, GMR still has uses in MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM) and other emerging applications of magnetism. I may be a bit biased because all my research is on magnetic materials and devices, but I’m hopeful about magnetic memory making a comeback in the future!

Lithium-ion Batteries

The right conditions for a wireless and fossil fuel-free society

The right conditions for a wireless and fossil fuel-free society

Another oft-unsung hero that (quite literally) powers your computer (and a lot of other things) is the subject of the 2019 Chemistry Nobel Prize. Like the blue LED, we never really think about them, even though they’re everywhere. (That is, until a Tesla spontaneously combusts again, but I digress…)

There’s not much I can (or want to) say about them because… yeah, they’re batteries, so here’s a cute illustration from the Nobel Prize press release showing how they work:

An Integrated World

Of course, I can’t end this blog post without talking about the basis of all modern microelectronics:

The Integrated Circuit

A market survey… showed that interest in a pocket calculator was negligible. After all, people had slide-rules!

A market survey… showed that interest in a pocket calculator was negligible. After all, people had slide-rules!

Every single chip in your computer (unless you spilled a bag of Doritos or something over it) is an integrated circuit. Every single chip in your car, your microwave – pretty much any electronic device that does computation – is an integrated circuit. Our world would be completely unrecognizable without them, which is why the 2000 Physics Nobel Prize was awarded for the invention of the integrated circuit (IC).

The idea behind ICs is relatively straightforward – put all the components of a traditional electrical circuit on a single piece of silicon – but the devil is always in the details. Keep in mind that back in the 1950s when Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce invented the IC, they did not have computers to help them design anything, so everything had to be done painstakingly by hand.

Despite this challenge, they persisted and eventually succeeded. And thus began the birth of the modern computer. Over time, these ICs became progressively more powerful, and we eventually began using them to design even better chips. Almost as if a superintelligent AI started generating progressively more intelligent versions of itself, for better or for worse.

The first monolithic silicon IC chip, created by Robert Noyce. Although it doesn’t look super impressive, this invention would go on to change history.

I didn’t list any prizes before 2000, but that was just because I didn’t want this blog post to get uncontrollably long. I highly encourage you to browse the list of past physics and chemistry Nobel laureates – you’ll be amazed by how many of their discoveries eventually found their way into your computer!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MIT-Bawendi_2283-F-01-PRESS-800x533.jpg

In many ways,Fatima A. '25,3,2023-10-07T00:00:00-04:00,"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. 

In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. 

In the summer of 2022, I was living in Chicago. I didn’t know anyone I was living with. Over the course of the summer, I got very close with my roommate but, the summer was mostly miserable. I had already decided to apply to the Admissions Blogs at some point during freshman year. My roommate Jenny B. ’25 was a blogger so I would often talk to her about her blogs, and see her post them. It was always an event. Our other roommate, Nora and I would race to comment first. Around that time, I also realized that I liked writing; the blogs seemed like a good platform and the bloggers, a good community. 

Then, began the process of writing three blog posts, pieces of writing that I could call representative, of myself, my personality, my writing and my voice. I decided to make the three posts different in some ways, one more so a narration of events happening, one more reflective and a third, which was maybe a mix of both. 

The thought was always to create something large, something big—to write something that meant something—something touching, something real. 

 

We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. 

We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. 

There is something strange about writing for the public. You are giving up pieces of deep thought and stories, things that you may not even have told close friends. When I write semester summaries, I feel this deeply.  It’s what they say, the mortifying ordeal of being known. 

Perhaps because there is no direct way of getting criticism on the blogs, I am usually my own critic. I feel like I have a lot of freedom over the content and frequency of my blogs. I do not have to force-write posts if I am in a writer’s block and I do not have to force-write posts about things I don’t care about. 

 

We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. 

We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. 

I am always evaluating myself on how I am doing. I am usually not writing very consistently, which I would ideally like to fix.

Even when I am writing, I write out of the itch, the feeling that I need to write about something in particular. Sometimes, the words just flow together and sometimes, I am stuck with the same feeling for months, never quite finding the right words.  

My literature professor once said something along the lines of, I am not a writer, I am a critic. I appreciate the process, but I just can’t do it. 

When I am not a writer, I am a critic. I look over everything I have written, deeming it inadequate in both quality and quantity. I am reminded of the fact that I always wanted to write at least one great post, one piece that I could be proud of, one piece I could hold in my hands and say, you, yes you, are my great work. 

When the critic ruffles through pages of my old posts, everything is average, maybe not bad, but not great either. When the critic looks at old works, nothing stands out. There is truth in all my writing, and the writer would like to believe that there is meaning too, but will there ever be something truly great? 

 

But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. 

But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. 

When the colors of the critic wear off and the words come into reach, the smallest of ideas feel significant. Beads of words, strewn together to express the simplest of concepts bring joy. Pride, even. When the writer writes, the average posts recover ownership. All my posts, all representative of me, my writer self, who makes mistakes and thinks about small things and makes bad decisions and goes back for a hundred visions and revisions. 

Perhaps, my average piece of junk, too, carries meaning. More than I would care to admit when I am the critic. 

I want to want to celebrate mediocrity. My own. But, deep down, there is always a clash between the person who wants to write and the person who wants to write well and I am still trying to find answers on how to balance that well. 

 

But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defence of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations, the new needs friends… Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.

I took the poetry workshop class because Alan Z. ’23 and Tooba S. ’21 recommended it to me. I was excited to bring my poems to class, to hear what my classmates would think and to see what they had been writing. I kept writing poetry because I was doing poetry workshop with Alan and other folks over the summer. And, then advanced poetry workshop. And, then winter poetry workshop… I kept writing because of the people who would point out phrases and lines that were also close to my heart, who would find the meaning I wanted the reader to find. 

And, it kinda, sorta always comes back to communities, doesn’t it? English is not my first language. I did not know what iambic pentameter meant until freshman fall. A lot of the times, when my friends use phrases, I stop them and ask. I stutter through words and often use the wrong words. 

But, I still write. And, I want to write. And as I am writing this, I am thinking maybe it is enough. To only ever write and never be a writer. 

 

In many ways, the work of a writer is easy. We deliberate a lot, offering ourselves up to people, yet enjoy the sweet taste of knowing something more, smiling mischievously at the thought of being an insider. We thrive on explorative destruction, which is fun for writers and readers. But the bitter truth we writers must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of our writing is probably more meaningful to us than readers finding it so. But there are times when a writer truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.",,0
Baseball!!,Kayode D. '27,9,2023-10-04T00:00:00-04:00,"Hello world! My name is Kayode Dada, and I am one of the seven new MIT Admissions Bloggers! I started writing a very sentimental, highly anticipated introduction blog, but that’s taking longer than expected. Every time I try to write it I get sad and miss home and put it off ‘til later. I will get around to introducing myself and Kentucky soon, so just imagine this blog came out after my next one or something. The elevator-pitch run-down of the intro blog is “Cambridge has no fields or horses or Walmarts and I wish that it did. Kentucky is small and I like it that way. I’m afraid of the Wolf of Wall Street.” 

…

When freshmen first get to campus, they are technically not freshmen yet and are called “Prefrosh.” After the first day of classes, you become a freshman, but until then you are just a silly little baby that 
        doesn’t know what to do.
      
 We all went through orientation and REX week, where we alternated between lessons about the police on campus and resources available, and random events like playing underground capture the flag in the main campus building. We even built a giant wooden trojan duck and challenged east campus to a 
        water fight.
      


It was a fun time, and they even added a competition aspect to it. They split the class into 10 teams of approximately 100 kids, and for every mandatory event that we attended, our team could earn points. The team with the most points at the end of the week would win a big prize like an aquarium trip or something. In this year’s case, the prize was Red Sox tickets. 

Well, ladies, and gentleman, I am proud to announce that our very own Red Team took home the dubski and won the 
        Red Sox Tickets.
      
 Today, on 
        September 23,
      
 was the game, and I am currently writing it after the events.

Me when Baseball

Here is my honest review: 

It was pretty aight. It rained, and it was cold, and my butt was wet. I think that they should invest in developing stadium seats that don’t perfectly pool water on them. I’m not talking about a perfect system, but someone could probably come up with a better way to make seats that don’t pool water and drench your butt. 

The game was slow. No one scored until the top of the ninth, when the opposing White Sox hit a home run. I have no allegiance to the Red Sox, but winning is fun and I wanted to have fun. For the first time in the game, I paid full attention to what was happening, and the whole stadium cheered for the red sox as Enmanuel Valdez hit a single with only one out– we could still win! Then Bobby Dalbec struck out swinging (because the red sox can’t be too good), and Reese Mcguire stepped up to bat. When I say that we had no faith in this guy, we had 0 faith. But then he proceeded to hit the ball 4 times (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and three of them were fouls, but the fourth time was a single!!!! WE”RE BACK BABY!

Then Rafeala struck out swinging. Mediocre gameplay, I was disappointed. McGuire was the mvp of the game, clutched up. 

Perhaps I am being too unfair. I set my expectations too high. While I am not an avid baseball fan, I 
        am
      
 an active fan of Blaseball, the ninth best game on the internet in 2020. Without going too deep into the lore, Blaseball is an internet 
        horror
      
 game where computer generated baseball teams play simulated baseball games, but with a number of twists. There’s raining peanuts and gunbats and umpires who go rogue and kill people. The game is full of interesting characters and events, like Chorby Short, who got softlocked into hitting 2345 foul balls in a single season, or Kelvin Drumsolo, who spent four days 
        as the only batter for the Core Mechanics. 
      
But what makes it truly special is the fans: fans who write TONS of lore, create amazing music and art, and feed the community to make blaseball seem like something more than just a game. Blaseball genuinely had a massive impact on me in high school, and I fully encourage anyone to look into it more, there’s a whole wiki page dedicated to it: https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Main_Page. I kinda want to write a blog just talking about blaseball, but it would genuinely take a full book to begin to appreciate the complex lore and meaning that baseball has had to its fans and communities. 

Now compare the beautiful chaos of blaseball to 8 innings of no hits in the rain at my first baseball game in 10 years. I thought that the red sox were like the best in the league, so I was a little disappointed. I bet I will eventually go to a more entertaining game in the future. 

The food, on the other hand, was most excellent. My friends and I were especially excited for the “Fenway Franks,” which I initially mistook for Boston’s minor league team name. Turns out they were just regular hot dogs but they cost six dollars. Yet again, MIT came in clutch, paying for not only our tickets, but also giving each person 15 dollars for food. For a free hotdog, it was very good. 

We could have also spent the money on the gift shops, but 15 dollars would have been a drop in the bucket compared to the Red Sox prices. TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS for a jersey. They did have an embroidered hat that I wanted to get that said “Green Monster Fenway Park,” but it was 40 dollars and I didn’t want to spend that much money. I do want to collect hats, though. I’ve had the same haircut since I was born, so hats are my way of self expression on my head. The Green Monster hat expresses that “I like the Boston Red Sox, but not enough to be proud of it. I just like the idea.”

But by far, the best part of the game was the goofy lil baseball songs that they played in between innings and at the end of the game. I tried my hardest to find them, but shazam and google humming have let me down yet again. Born too late to see the Red Sox be good, born too early to find the silly Red Sox Baseball song with a google search [sad emoji]…

BORN JUST IN TIME TO GO TO NEWBURY COMICS

NEWBURY COMICS!!

Newbury Comics is a phenomenal store. A few weeks ago I bought some 
        new vans
      
 for the school year and the store gave me a coupon for 25 dollars off a 75 dollar purchase. That’s like a third of a pair of shoes! (or 5 pairs of socks, whatever floats your boat). After the baseball game, me and my friends agreed to go to the Vans store on the walk back to campus to spend the coupon. However, we got sidetracked into a glorious place called Newbury Comics. 

It was incredible. They literally had something for everyone there. There were comics (duh), t-shirts, posters, a wall of funko pops, and an entire floor of music. More records, cd’s and cassettes than I’ve ever seen in one room. What I was even more shocked by, however, was the selection of music that they had. It seemed like everywhere I turned, they had another record or CD for a band I loved but had never actually seen physical music for in a store. I found an 
        Origami Angel record
      
, a MASSIVE selection of King Gizzard records, and even heard a girl exclaim “
        Charlie Brown Great Pumpkin record
      
!” and held it up in the air. I searched everywhere for it but couldn’t find it after her. Maybe it never existed to begin with. 

I wasn’t planning on buying anything in particular, but then I found something I couldn’t pass up: 

THE BETHS EXPERT IN A DYING FIELD DELUXE EDITION. 

 

I Love The Beths. They’re an Indie Rock band from Auckland, New Zealand, and my current favorite band. I found their song, “Future Me Hates Me,” last fall and I’ve loved the band ever since. Every song is so well written and there’s so much raw emotion in it. I would compare the band to Hanif Abdurraqib’s description of Carly Rae Jepsen in his essay, 
        Carly Rae Jepsen Loves You Back
      
 The lead singer, Elizabeth Stokes, sings with such conviction and emotion and it almost seems like a different person from when she talks in interviews or between songs. It’s clear they just love to make music, and I would 100% recommend this band to anyone. Go listen to Expert In A Dying Field Deluxe Edition!

Anyways, I bought the record. I don’t even have a record player, but I knew I loved the band and I may never get a chance to buy this record again! The sticker on the record said that they only made 2000 records, and one of them was in my hands, so I had to buy it. I’m not sure what I’ll do with it yet, but my roommates and I may try to use Simmons money to buy a record player “for the lounge” so we can listen to the stuff we bought. 

It also came with this sick poster that I’m gonna put on my dorm wall. 

That’s all, I just wanted to post soon.

Attack of the Acronyms,Allison E. '27,7,2023-10-03T00:00:00-04:00,"“Massachusetts Institute of Technology” is a name with 37 characters, 12 syllables, and a state name that I am still completely incapable of spelling. Luckily for the sake of our collective sanity, however the abbreviated “MIT” has more or less eclipsed its expanded form. With 3 characters, 3 syllables, and a literally self-explanatory spelling, even official websites and documentation are more likely to use “MIT”—so much so that the acronym is probably more recognizable than the full name.

It’s therefore quite fitting that, upon arriving on campus, the first thing we freshmen were greeted with was an absolute flood of more acronyms. In fact, I think I’ve seen more acronyms in the past few weeks than in my entire life—every club name, every administrative office, and every program is compressed into a handful of letters: 
        OFY,
      
 
        CAPD,
      
 
        LSC,
      
 
        SWE,
      
 
        CXC
      
… the list goes on. Trying to decipher these acronyms can sometimes feel like a fun little game, and someday (hopefully) I won’t have to search my email inbox every time I need to translate. 

That day is unfortunately a long way off, but so far I’ve had at least two acronyms ingrained in my head. They’re the ones that defined my first week+ here at MIT, so if there’s any acronyms I can explain to you, these are it. First up—FPOPs!

FPOPs: First-Year Pre-Orientation Programs

I arrived on campus on August 22, five days before Orientation began, to participate in the Discover Aerospace FPOP! In my overly simplified interpretation, you can think of FPOPs basically like mini summer camps. They introduce you to departments and/or communities at MIT—from Nuclear Science to The Arts—while also giving you a chance to settle into your dorm early, meet some upperclassmen, and make some new friends!

The aerospace FPOP that I did was a flurry of activity—building balsa wood gliders, touring labs, launching bottle rockets, and eating lots of free food. But as much as I enjoyed the projects (and the food), I don’t think my favorite part of the FPOP actually ended up being learning about rocket propulsion or standing in a giant wind tunnel. 

Instead, it was all the spaces in between—the little Shrek figurines that we made out of modeling clay, and taking selfies with stupid signs on campus. It was the night when four of us took the 
        Red Line to Central
      
 and shared a pack of mooncakes at H-Mart. It was the 
        JEE Advanced
      
 problems passed around the bus on our way to tour a startup, and the lunch boxes scribbled with calculations. (This is the most stereotypically MIT thing I can possibly think of, and I love it.)

Most of all, though, it was the adventure that happened after we got off the nerd bus (nerd being very much a term of affection <3). It was 5:48 PM, and we were completely done with the day’s prescribed activities! We had never finished before dinnertime, let alone 6:00 pm, and now… freedom :D

But what to do with it?

 

“What time does the 
        COOP
      
 close?” someone asked.

According to Google, 6:00 pm.

“How long does it take to get there?”

According to Google, 15 minutes by foot.

“There’s no way we can make it.”

“Right?”

“Uhhh…”

One person took off running. Another of us followed, then two more, and the challenge was on.

Or at least, it was on for the first 90 seconds. Before long, one of us (me) succumbed to our (my) lack of physical conditioning and folded over, panting. We stopped for a second, and walked for another few. Then there was a crosswalk in our way. We waited. We ran. We stopped. We walked. We waited. We persevered.

And eventually, at 5:56 pm, we arrived at the Kendall Square COOP, exhausted but triumphant. Seven minutes ahead of Google’s estimate! We pulled open the front door of the COOP to find—

It didn’t budge. There was a man standing ten feet from the door, staring at us. He tapped at his wrist. They’d closed! Early!!

To be fair, this makes complete sense—you can’t really be letting in new customers four minutes before closing. Nevertheless, the sense of bereavement was palpable. The mission we had toiled over for so long (eight minutes) was a complete and utter failure!

However, like the good, tenacious MIT students we all strive to be, the four of us decided that a new objective was in order. We would cross the illustrious 
        Harvard Bridge
      
 and continue onwards to Trader Joe’s!

Why of all things a grocery store, you might ask? Well, as it turns out, my three companions were international students who’d heard about Trader Joe’s, but never been. And as someone from 
        a state completely deprived of Trader Joe’s,
      
 I was equally excited for a visit, so off we went!

I’ll spare you from the rest of the details, but suffice to say that we were diverted from our mission quite incessantly—by a mini shopping trip at 
        Muji,
      
 a turn down the wrong street, a visit to a music store, and a very intense debate about the meaning of life. By the time we took the 1 Bus back across the bridge, however, our spoils had been secured: chocolate-covered gummies, fake Takis, ghost pepper chips that were not at all spicy, and a so-called “British Toffee” that our notably British companion had never seen in his life.

And that was the end of the last full day of FPOPs! It was a glorious adventure to cap off both an incredibly interesting program and an incredibly silly round of shenanigans. If you want more information, check out this page, but otherwise we can move onwards to the next acronym in the first-year tidal wave: REX!

REX: Residence Exploration

In one sentence, REX is a 4-day 
        avalanche of student-run events
      
 at the beginning of Orientation, with the aim of helping first-years figure out which dorm is right for them. If you’ve ever heard of 
        CPW,
      
 think of that, but geared towards dorm exploration! At both CPW and REX there’s something like ten events going on at any given time, which gives you an incredible choice of things to do—from ceiling tile painting to escape rooms to “how many question marks can you draw in a minute?”

CPW and REX are therefore experiences without a default path, which means that everyone has some kind of “approach” to them (conscious or unconscious). For some, that’s carefully Google calendar-ing each and every event they want to see, and for others it’s spinning a wheel and picking a random new event every hour. There’s no way to do it wrong! But it’s definitely interesting to think about the ways that might exist.

During CPW, my strategy had been to put every event I might enjoy onto my calendar, then hour-by-hour pick the perfect event for my current mood. It was very much an event-focused approach, where I was trying to examine the vibes of each group and take advantage of all the Interesting Things To Do™. And I think it worked very well for me! I accumulated vague impressions of the dorms, some clubs, and I suppose MIT in general? I also did a lot of 
        cool things
      
 that I’d never had the chance to do!

The one thing I didn’t do at CPW, however, was form any relationships that went further than acquaintanceships. I know some people who came out of CPW with a burgeoning friend group, and that was really meaningful for them. But while I actually did put a lot of energy into talking with people, my prioritization of events over staying with particular people meant I never stayed with the same group for more than an hour or two. And that worked perfectly fine for me at CPW! 

But with REX being the opening salvos of the school year, this time around I was a little more interested in the people than the events (which again, is just one of many possible paths to take). I let go of my personalized list of events and tried to be a bit more spontaneous, following an FPOP friend to paint a comet mural in New House, and even tagging along with another friend to their friends’ random hangout—a puzzle-solving session outside of REX events altogether! 

Combined with the shenanigans of FPOPs, my focus on people during REX ended up being incredibly valuable for me. As someone that’s generally nervous about social dynamics, my FPOP gave me the jumpstart I needed to develop actual friendships (forced proximity really is such a powerful thing…), and I was then able to use REX to solidify those relationships outside the structure of FPOP activities! This is obviously not going to be the same for everybody, and who knows—maybe in a couple months I’ll look back and none of this will have mattered. But the memories and friendships I’ve made so far have been amazing, and I can’t wait for what the next four years has in store :D",,0
My Summer in Japan,Emiko P. '25,5,2023-10-01T00:00:00-04:00,"ようこそ、みなさん！
      
 It is my pleasure to welcome you to Japan: the country of neon-lit karaoke bars, culture spanning thousands of years, and heated toilet seats.

This summer, I interned at a lunar exploration company called ispace. They are a Japan-based company in Tokyo who attempted to be the first private company to land on the moon earlier this year. While their first attempt, Mission 1, may have unfortunately 
        hard-landed
      
, their success in at least arriving to the moon is incredibly impressive. 

But don’t worry, ispace didn’t give up there.

As part of my internship, I was working on ispace’s Mission 2 attempt as a part of the 
        MISTI Japan program
      
. I was interning with two different teams: The first being the Avionics team, which could be compared to the nervous system of the lander. We were in charge of the electrical system and the power consumption of the mission, so I worked on analyzing a lot of data from Mission 1 to better inform our sensors and equipment during Mission 2. We also tested several sensors to make sure they were space-grade — which basically means we heated them up to a mind-boggling temperature to mimic the sun’s heat and then shook them around a bunch to mimic take-off. 

The other team I worked with was the Assembly, Integration, and Testing team. In order to work with them, I commuted two hours away to the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (or JAXA, Japan’s version of NASA). Here is where the 2-meter-tall lander was actually built. Every day, I put on my lil’ uniform consisting of a white lab coat, special shoes, super sick hairnet, and gloves and went to work in a clean room. Another MIT student, a graduate from the Class of 2022 that is doing her masters at MIT for Manufacturing, was interning on this team with me. Together, we got to install electrical equipment in the lander. Every once in a while it hit me that: Woah. I’m touching something that’s going to the moon. 

I loved my coworkers and my job, and I often told my family that I felt like I was in an episode of The Office whenever I came to work. I mean, my mentor was a 6 foot 5 Argentinian who loved listening to country music and would often bust out singing some random Morgan Wallen song. My other coworker was a Frenchman who only drank his meals in liquid form and made fun of me whenever I put a drop of sugar in my coffee (I always put in two packs of sugar… sue me). Another coworker was an MIT Class of 2016 graduate in 
        Course 16
      
, and she was the one that actually flew the lander in Mission 1. Not only was she kind enough to show me the Mission Control room and teach me some of the flight commands, she was also really fun to go to karaoke and sing Jay Z with!

On top of the fact that my job was epic and quite literally the stuff of childhood dreams, I also got to live in Japan! My grandma is Japanese, so I have visited quite often before (even going to Japanese elementary school for two summers when I was a kid), but I would usually always stay in the quiet countryside amidst the mountains and rice fields.

Tokyo is, well, the opposite of that. Tokyo is home to 
        14 million people
      
, and the city, with its towering skyscrapers and screeching trains, can be overwhelming. However, slowly but surely, I became immersed in the daily life of a Tokyoite.

After work, I would often take the train home and go play pick-up soccer. It was usually about two dozen men from the age of 25 to 50 years old… and me — a curly-haired American girl that was usually taller than them. After playing for two hours, breaking some ankles, and all of us getting oddly competitive, it was time for me to grab dinner. I’d usually read a book (I was reading The Stormlight Archives series all summer!) and 
        eat ramen or Japanese beef bowls
      
 at the local shops by my apartment in Shibuya. 

On the weekends, I would go on adventures. I went on the bullet train to visit my family in Nagano and Kyoto; I would go to karaoke bars and firework shows with my coworkers; me and the other participants in the MISTI program helped make a hand-forged katana; I visited old shrines and played in interactive art museums with friends. The Tokyo train system became second nature, and its web of twisted, multi-colored lines are now engraved in my memory.

I am so happy that I took the gamble to live in a new city for these 2.5 months of summer, to be one of the 14 million going about their daily life. I am happy that I got to go to firework shows with the MIT kids in our program, eat ramen by the gallon, and call this place home for a bit :)

While I appreciated the heated toilet seats and liveliness of Japan, I also missed the abundance of Targets and the excessive use of cheese in the US. To the US: It’s good to be back! And to Japan:

Setbacks,"Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",5,2023-10-01T00:00:00-04:00,"I’ve gotten a little better at planning. I use a Notion now like all the cool kids, and it’s great because I get to customize my planner the way it fits me best. This is one of the pages I’ve made for myself:

notice how I left last week’s assignments here so you’ll look at this and think, “wow Jebby’s so productive”

Anyway, I’m not going to do a full tour of my Notion because I’m not writing this post to show off how productive I am right now. I haven’t even done any work today.

Today was supposed to be Ultra Productive Study Session Day. Every two weeks, I make a pilgrimage to Lamont Library in Harvard and camp there for hours. It’s far enough from my dorm that I don’t feel the magnetic attraction of my own bed. It’s quieter than Hayden but not as deathly-quiet as Barker, and my favorite libraries at MIT are closed on the weekends anyway.

I’ll tell you what I did instead. I woke up, immediately knew that my body was not having it today, lied back down in bed and slept until 3 PM. Had a bizarre dream where I found out that Season 3 of The Bear was going to take place in the middle of Siberia. I woke up, tried to study, but ended up lying down again. Couldn’t go to sleep. I watched Hermitcraft videos for two hours. Now I’m here.



To officially celebrate my entrance into early adulthood, my body recently obtained this cool adult feature called “Migraines.” At least, I think they’re migraines. Whatever they are, they’re different from normal headaches. They make me feel all discombobulated and yucky, as if the fluctuating brain-throbbing sensations don’t make me want to explode enough. Something with hormones, I think. If you know what I’m talking about, you know.



Migraines stink. No matter how much Ultra Productive Study Sessioning I was gearing myself up to do today, I just couldn’t do it.

I’m pretty bummed out about that too, not gonna lie. I was hyped to get ahead in my assignments because this upcoming week is so packed, but no amount of planning is immune to the inevitable forces of nature and the unfortunate effects it can produce.

I’m going to make a compromise with myself. It’s too late to cram everything I wanted to do today in the next few hours, neither is that something my head can handle right now. I’m going to sleep at a reasonable time tonight (which I didn’t do last night… probably another reason why my brain is angry). This means that I’ll have to spend more time in the next several days, yes. But I’d rather cut my losses now and let my body rest, rather than stumbling through my priorities and prolonging the situation.

Misconceptions,Jessica Z. '27,10,2023-09-30T00:00:00-04:00,"I first stepped onto MIT’s campus in the summer of my junior year, and it was my first impression of what college life could truly look like. I didn’t visit many colleges outside of my local area in high school, and my parents also didn’t go to college, so I couldn’t ask them about their personal experiences. When I entered high school and became more serious about college, I tried searching for answers on my own. My impression of college was from scrolling on college websites, watching media, or asking others, all of which naturally gave me different ideas of what to expect. While the information I learned was useful, it couldn’t quite supplement the feeling of actually being on campus. 

That being said, I went into MIT without a concrete idea of what exactly I was getting into. I had a few ideas about how I thought college would go—in some ways, I was right, but in a lot, lot, lot more ways, I was wrong about college life, particularly here at MIT. I’ve only been on campus for a a little over a month and attended classes for three weeks, but here are a few of my misconceptions (and some truths!) that I’ve learned so far.

Classes

One of my biggest misconception about MIT was classes: I was nervous that I would feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of STEM in comparison to the humanities, but I’ve quickly learned that this just isn’t true. In fact, as part of MIT’s
        GIRs,
      
all undergraduate students are required to take eight
        HASS
      
class subjects. One of my favorite classes this semester is my HASS class
        STS.011.
      
Granted, this class is still related to STEM, but it takes a much more social, philosophical, and ethical look at the future of biotechnology. Despite it being my earliest class of the day, the professor makes the in-class discussions and coursework really engaging. 

One part I did get right, though, is that college is hard. Everyone says it, and I always believed it, but it really started to click when classes began. In addition to STS.011, I’m taking three GIRs this semester:
        18.01, 8.01, and 5.111.
      
Between balancing my 
        20.A06 advising seminar
      
and
        15.000 discovery course,
      
it’s a lot to keep up with. 

I was also originally taking
        6.100A.
      
I’ve never coded more than ten lines of python before coming to MIT, so I knew the learning curve would be pretty significant, but I quickly learned I wouldn’t be able to handle the class along with my other responsibilities. I understand why people get satisfaction from coding—there’s something about seeing code run smoothly, sans errors and red squiggly lines, that makes a part of my brain click. But beyond those rare moments for me, I find coding to be really frustrating. After a long internal debate, I decided to drop it. I was nervous to email my advisor letting him know I wanted to drop a class, but he was really understanding! In fact, he was glad I chose to drop it early in the semester so I didn’t stress too much. 

Earlier last week, I also got sick. I fell asleep for what was meant to be an hour-long nap before 8.01, but I woke up feeling even worse. In 8.01, they take attendance by answering in-class content questions as part of our grade, but I truly felt too bad to go to class. Luckily, I dropped in last-minute to talk to
        S3
      
and got excused. I used the time when I felt better to catch up on the content I missed with the help of friends. So while yes, classes are hard to balance with life,
        it’s really nice to know that there’s resources and people who are more than willing to help.
      
 

Community

I’ve heard horror stories from graduating seniors at my high school that the social aspect of college was so overwhelming that it ruined their first year for them. My high school was small with a graduating class of twenty-four students, so it was easy for me to feel comfortable exploring an environment where I was always familiar with the people around me. I was convinced I would spend most of my time anxious meeting so many new people on campus at once, but I couldn’t have been more wrong—all the people I’ve met so far, whether it be from my dorm floor or advising seminar or other clubs, have been really nice. 

Another misconception: I never thought I would ever participate in
        recruitment,
      
let alone actually join a sorority. When some of my friends started talking about recruitment week, I almost immediately casted it out of my mind because it didn’t seem like something I would enjoy. College sororities are often portrayed as exclusive and not academically-focused in media, and I hate to admit that it’s hard to shake some of those stigmas. But, I figured I would try recruitment just in case.

Recruitment week is a lot of talking to different sorority members and admittedly a bit exhausting, but I found myself enjoying my conversations with the upperclassman. I also realized throughout the week that the conversations we had focused on our core values, aspirations, academics, and service, and I slowly became more open to the idea of joining a sorority. I joined Alpha Chi Omega at the end of the week, and I’m really excited to be part of it!

Balance

My biggest misconception, however, was that college is just academics. When I committed to MIT in late April, I feared being sucked into a world of constant studying. But college is much more than just classes—it’s given me such a wide breadth of experiences and opportunities that I wouldn’t have otherwise. I scroll through my camera roll at night and remember all the first-year traditions that I will always look fondly back on, like Orientation,
        REX,
      
and
        FPOP.
      
It’s the late-night walking by the Charles River, overspending at Muji and Teado, sunset-watching by Kendall Square, running through pouring rain to pset, and almost crying from laughing with friends that makes college feel so much more human than just a place to study. 

Almost everyday, I find myself having a jarring moment where I think to myself that I am here. Not for a day, not for a week, not even for a month. I am here for the next four years of my undergraduate education. I get this feeling when I realize that, no, I’m not shipping a package to Pennsylvania, but to my dorm in Boston. I feel it when I realize that if I want to just go shopping or visit a cool place nearby or visit a lab, I simply can. As a first-generation college student, I always wondered “what is college going to be like?”, and it’s crazy to now think to myself, “this is what college is.”

I’ve only been here for three weeks of classes, so it’s safe to say I have a lot more misconceptions that I’m not quite aware of yet. Despite all the uncertainty that I’m feeling, college finally feels real, and I look forward to documenting the next four years :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0912_2-1-800x450.jpg

How to make a glass pumpkin,Andi Q. '25,1,2023-09-29T00:00:00-04:00,"Last Saturday was MIT’s annual Great Glass Pumpkin Patch!

So many pumpkins!

Every year, the MIT Glass Lab sells over two thousand blown glass pumpkins to fund ourselves. The revenue from these pumpkins is a big reason why glassblowing classes at MIT are about ten times cheaper than similar classes anywhere else! If you’ve ever been to the Great Glass Pumpkin Patch before, you’ve probably wondered: How does MIT make so many pumpkins every year? Is it someone’s full-time job to churn out pumpkin after pumpkin non-stop until we have enough to stock the sale?

Concept art of a glassblowing gremlin. Thanks, generative AI!

Thankfully, we do not need a pumpkin gremlin to remain operational. Instead, we have “pumpkin crews” – small teams of glassblowers who gather for a few hours a day to make batches of 
        about two dozen
      
 pumpkins at a time. And we usually only need to start making pumpkins a few months before the sale.

When I first learned about this fact, it raised more questions than it answered. “Two dozen pumpkins in just a few hours? How is that humanly possible? The pumpkins are so intricate – surely it should take an entire day to make just a single pumpkin?”

As it turns out, making a glass pumpkin is a surprisingly straightforward 9-step process. As MIT Admissions’ resident glassblower (now that Shuli is 
        no longer with us
      
), let me tell you about it! After all, I’ve made… counts on fingers… two whole glass pumpkins before – I’m basically an expert now!

- First, you’ll want to gather some hot glass onto a blowpipe. Immediately after gathering, smooth out the blob of glass with a tool called a “block” and blow a small bubble into it.

- While the glass is still hot, gather another layer of glass. And let’s make the pumpkin colourful! Roll the new layer of glass in some purple glass dust (called “frit”). While we’re here, let’s also add some white speckles.

- Smooth out the blob of glass with the block again, and blow the bubble bigger. Keep blowing until there’s about an inch of glass between the tip of the bubble and the outside of the glass.

- Roll the blob on a stainless steel table (called a “marver”) until it becomes cylindrical.

- Heat the glass back up (the marver cools it down a lot) and dip it into a star-shaped glass mold (called an “optic mold”). Push down gently, blow the glass, and then stop and let it hang for about 2 seconds.

- We’re almost there! Now, heat the glass back up again and start blowing. While you’re blowing, push on the tip of the glass with—

Oh. Huh. The glass just burst open. That has never happened to me before…

…

OH!

The frit should go on the FIRST layer of clear glass, not the second! And I guess white and purple glass expand at different rates when heated. Oops…

Anyway, let’s start over.

…

- Ok, we’re back where we first left off. As I said, blow the glass while pushing the tip with glassblowing jacks.

- Before the glass cools down too much, squeeze it near the end of the pipe with the jacks, and then pull it hard away from you.

- Push the tip of the glass a bit more to shape the glass more like a pumpkin.

- Time to make a stem! Get an assistant to gather a small blob of glass and shape it in a tiny optic mold. Then—

Oh no, we were slightly too slow. The glass has cooled down too much and fallen off the blowpipe! The third time’s the charm, I guess.

…

- Make a stem and attach it to your pumpkin. Et voilà – you’re done!

Super simple, straightforward 24-step process!

My (semi-successful) pumpkin after all this! (I gave up on using colour because it was too hard…)

Glass pumpkin instructions, but for real this time. In theory, pretty simple. In theory.

As you can imagine, the professional glassblowers at MIT do not need multiple attempts over 24 steps to make a single pumpkin. Some are so good that they don’t even need to look at the glass actively while making pumpkins! (It’s super mesmerizing to watch the pumpkin crews work their magic because they’re so efficient – I’d highly recommend doing so if you’re around the lab.)

This semester, I’m lucky enough to take the intermediate glassblowing class at MIT. I’m super excited to continue honing my glassblowing skills (and hopefully join a pumpkin crew myself soon)!","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/glass-pumpkin-patch-800x600.jpeg

river and rainwater,Audrey C. '24,1,2023-09-29T00:00:00-04:00,"Living off campus this year means that I don’t head home until my last on campus Thing, which is almost always late into the evening. I turn on my blinking bike lights, flip my kickstand, and pedal as fast as I can across the Harvard Bridge. There’s a speedometer halfway across the bridge that sometimes detects me as a moving entity. My record on my rusty old bike is 19 mph; I wonder how fast I’d be able to go on a sleek road bike instead.  Only occasionally do I glance to the side and notice the glittery Boston skyline reflected off of the glossy black surface of the Charles River. As always, it’s beautiful. Biking over the Charles has become such a constant in my life recently, and I fear I’m starting to take it for granted.

It’s been raining sooo much lately. I romanticize rain when I’m indoors listening to the drumming of droplets on my window, but my daily schedule forces me to face the elements. In the early mornings and the late nights, the chilliness seeps through my jacket if rainwater hasn’t already. The warm days of summer have already breathed their dying breaths, the vibrant foliage of October has yet to come — the inbetweenness of September is just so… gray.

Today it’s raining again. Normally I’d just bike through it, but petrichor wafts through my window and I grab my umbrella instead of my helmet.

Because I rarely walk the path from home to school, I decide to take advantage of the slowness of it all and take pictures of what lies in between on my way back home. I am also motivated by my obligations as a Content Creator.

I exit Building 1 and onto Massachusetts Avenue, aka Mass Ave. Bostonian drivers are ruthless everywhere, but somehow signaling turns and obeying basic traffic laws (like not turning right on red when the sign says NO TURN ON RED) becomes especially optional on Mass Ave.

that “castle” is Maseeh, one of the on campus dorms perhaps most known for its dining hall, for better or for worse

Right after that intersection, Mass Ave gets you onto Harvard Bridge. Harvard Bridge is painted with tickmarks 10 Smoots apart. Some of them are funny.

The speedometer seems as sleepy as I am and does not detect me as a moving entity despite walking at a fairly brisk pace.

the speedometer that perceives me everyday as I bike across the river

Faint “stripes” of darker water cut across the ambling current of the river. They remind me of Moiré patterns, like the rainbow ripples that you might see if you looked at your computer screen through a phone camera. In that case, the Moiré pattern comes from the fact that your camera frame rate is not lined up with your computer screen’s update rate. I don’t know if what I’m seeing in the Charles is also due to some periodic disturbance in the water, as I don’t know much about river dynamics, but it’s fun to wonder.

Millions, perhaps billions of droplets land on the vastness of the Charles all at once. It’s hard to see in the picture below, but each individual raindrop looks like a tiny black pebble. I love throwing pebbles into bodies of water. I am easily amused by things.



After I reach the other side of the river (aka “the Boston side,” as opposed to “the Cambridge side” where MIT lies), I turn onto Marlborough St. It’s probably the bright red doors and the well looked after trees, but Marlborough St. is as saturated in person as it is through my phone camera. Perhaps this is why brownstone buildings are that shade of reddish brown; they stand out against gray skies.



I then turn onto the public alley behind my frat house. Commonwealth Ave in front of my frat house is more well manicured, but I enjoy looking at telephone wires criss crossing across the sky, at porch gardens, fire escape stairwells tucked away from the hustle of Comm Ave.

I’m home! As they say, “It’s not a frat house, it’s a frat home“. My Timberland boots are surprisingly waterproof and my socks are only damp, but still uncomfortable enough for me to throw them in the laundry bag. Taking the time to walk home has been nice. :)","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_8357-rotated.jpg

i dissected a roach,Anika H. '26,9,2023-09-28T00:00:00-04:00,"content warning: discussions of roach uwu

Roaches are curious little creatures. They’ve nearly perfectly adapted to an urban environment, with a sturdy carapace, unparalleled scavenging prowess, and ability to fly. In other words, in a world that humans have built for themselves, the roach’s ability to thrive in all its squirming, leg-wiggling glory is terrifying.

On Tetazoo, we had a small streak where someone’s room seemed to become a roach spawn point for about a week. Most of them however, were either identified or caught by Harley. He’s consistently been the fastest sprinter down the hallway, and can probably spot a fly a building away. He’s got instincts akin to that of an experienced hunter. Harley is also the stinkiest little cat on hall and we love him.

Anyways, one time, when I found Harley batting away at a roach, I cupped its remains and took it away as usual. But to my surprise, because he tends to play with his food before he eats it, this particular roach was still mostly intact with the exception of half a leg and an antenna. I figured it would be a waste of a fresh corpse if I just threw it away, so against my best judgement, I decided to dissect it.

graphic details have been replaced with flowers for viewer discretion.

Now the rest of this post will contain detailed descriptions of our friendly neighborhood roach and her internal organs. It will be mildly gross, so viewer discretion is advised.

 

Basic Stats!

This is an American Cockroach (Periplaneta americana), a species of roach notorious for having a fast reproduction rate, spreading disease, being hard to kill, and being one of the most annoying household pests to get rid of. It’s currently in it’s nymph stage, since it hasn’t developed its wings yet and appears rather small for an adult (American cockroaches are the largest species of common roaches). You can also tell from the wider abdomen that this one is most likely a female. They live for 3 months to 2 years and females lay produce 150 young per year upon reaching adulthood.

almost-full roach, missing a few chunks of leg from the cat.

Setup

1 table

2 layers of cling wrap on top of the table

3 layers of paper towel on top of that to absorb liquid

Without a proper scalpel or other proper biology-related sharp things, I used an exacto knife, electronics tweezers, and (begrudgingly) the tiny scissors on my keychain multitool. I tried to get by with just the knife and the tweezers, but when I went to cut the exoskeleton with the knife, I nearly flung the roach across the table trying to cut sideways. Therefore for the safety of the wall, the intactness of the roach, and the preservation of my sanity, I had to sacrifice my one pair of small scissors.

 

Appendages

Before dissecting the rest of the roach, I removed the legs and antennae. Its feely bits and scuttlydoos got in the way of removing the carapace, so they were mostly cut, with the exception of one leg I thought I saw twitch a little bit. I wasn’t sure whether I imagined it or not, so I left it to see if it would react again. Their wigglers can take them up to 3 miles per hour, which is 50 body lengths per second, roughly equivalent to a human running 3 times as fast as a car on the highway.

Thorax

I first took off the small carapace covering the top of the thorax, revealing two lobes of flesh I initially thought were the lungs before quickly realizing that roaches didn’t have lungs. They were a set of thoracic muscles used to move the legs.

Abdomen and Digestive system

The abdomen was the most interesting part for me because it had the most stuff to unravel, metaphorically and literally. After removing the interstitial fat around the gut, I unrolled the intestines as carefully as I can with the tweezers. I still ended up accidentally poking a hole in the hind gut, causing a small blob of mostly-digested poop to spill out the side. The entire digestive system is around three times the length of the roach.

Head and– Nope

The rings on the exoskeleton around the neck would expand and contract when I tilted the head forward and back.

neck exoskeleton

Right before I started dissecting the head, I leaned in a bit too close and saw a blob of squishy white stuff in my hair.

It was roach guts.

I got roach guts in my hair.

I put everything down, washed my hands, and then chopped off that chunk of hair in the sink. This wasn’t quite the part where I stopped though. I went on to pry the compound eyes off the head, only getting bits at a time. Then I had a thought. Sometimes when I eat food or drink water, I would catch a bit of hair in my mouth. Even when I’m taking a test or something and straighten up from leaning over, the same thing tends to happen. At the image of eating a little bit of roach, I thought “I think I’ve had enough of this today.” and proceeded to pack up my stuff.

the joys of discovery

Clean up

I threw away the exacto blade I used and doused everything in way too much 90% isopropyl alcohol, removed my tools from the makeshift mat, and then wrapped everything to be discarded (roach and towels) in the cling wrap I had on the very bottom layer of the table, and chucked it in the trash. I wiped the table down as a last precaution.

browser archaeology,"Alan Z. '23, MEng '24",3,2023-09-27T00:00:00-04:00,"I’ve always been pretty picky about managing my tabs on my laptop—I don’t like having too many things open, since this inevitably slows down my computer more than I would otherwise like. These days, I use a web browser that 
        automatically archives tabs after 24 hours of inactivity,
      
which tends to keep things pretty clean.

My phone, however, is a different story. The problem with the phone browser is that, when I’m done looking at websites, I just close the whole thing, expecting the tabs to be gone afterwards. Yet, they persist, and when I return to Chrome, they are still there, yearning to be read. Some of these tabs have been open for nearly a year, with no hope of ever actually being closed or dealt with. This post commemorates their existence, providing commentary when it is needed.

poems (7)

Many of these poems I keep around because there is a line, or two, or maybe more which I keep coming back to. Mostly, I just scroll back up to them and read them whenever I need to, which is sometimes often.

- “Poem 133: The Summer Day” by Mary Oliver – the “Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?” poem

- “Wild Geese” by Mary Oliver – not sure why this is on a University of New Mexico Physics site, but I’m glad it is

- “Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds” by Shakespeare

- “Autumn Day” by Rainer Maria Rilke

- “回乡偶书二首” by 贺知章 – I learned this poem as a kid, and I heard it again recently at a performance of a bunch of short plays in Seattle, which made it interesting to come back to

- “The Second Coming” by W.B Yeats

- “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” by T.S. Eliot – my wing and I used to memorize parts of this poem, and I’m still not exactly sure why, but here it is

- “There is a vitality, a life force…” – this is not a poem, but it is a quote from Martha Graham to Agnes De Mille which talks about making art, which my old choir conductor introduced me to, and which I think about a lot

MIT websites (5)

- “Emerson/Harris Program for Private Study” – MIT provides a program for instrumentalists and vocalists to get private lessons for free! I’ve never even auditioned because it’s very scary, but the people who do it are incredibly talented, the recitals are very cool, and the tab lives on in my browser

- “Listening Tour” – as you may have heard, MIT got a new president last year, and she’s been going around and 
        listening to input from many different parts of the Institute,
      
which is pretty cool, and the feedback is publicly available!

- “thank you notes” – I have a habit of keeping around nice notes which people write me, because sometimes I need a bit of an emotional/ego boost when I’m feeling particularly down about things; this is one of those posts

- “MIT Policies & Procedures Section 9.2 Personal Conduct and Responsibilities Towards Students and Employees“

- “BSO College Card Program” – MIT subsidizes the BSO college card, which is a program that the Boston Symphony Orchestra provides to students. You buy one (1) card for $10, and you get to go to most concerts for free!! It’s worth it even if you just go to one concert :)

social media (4)

There was less of this than I expected—sometimes I have like five different 
        Twitter
      
 tabs open, but I guess I usually prune them when I realize that fact.

- a Facebook post about MIT’s president and our graduate student union negotiations

- John Fetterman’s Twitter profile

- Twitter.com (x2)

graduate school investigation (4)

I’ve been kicking around the idea of applying to various kinds of graduate school programs, and, for a brief period of time, I was thinking about applying to playwriting MFA programs. I’m now thinking that I’ll push that decision off a few more years, but, in the meantime, there’s still lots of writing to be done.

- BU Playwriting Admissions

- UIowa Theatre Arts Graduate Programs

- UT Austin Playwriting (MFA in Theatre)

- Michener Center for Writers (MFA in Writing)

random articles (7)

These are mostly things I wanted to read at some point but never really finished. I don’t have a lot of thoughts about them, because, well, I haven’t read them yet.

- “Hey Elon: Let Me Help You Speed Run The Content Moderation Learning Curve“

- “The Crimes of SEAL Team 6“

- “Researchers Achieve ‘Absurdly Fast’ Algorithm for Network Flow“

- “Everything We Know about the History of Diversity Is Wrong“

- “Cultural Crackdown in China Shuts Comedy and Music Shows“

- “Bar fights, neighbor disputes, playground justice: How ‘stand your ground’ plays out in court“

google searches (12)

because sometimes you search things and you don’t follow up.

- “piezoelectric bone” – I think this search is from a Dear Hank and John episode?

- “cops the musical” – someone in a pit orchestra I was conducting mentioned this

- “bob widlar“

- “chunking express“

- “watch spider-man: into the spiderverse” – I wanted to watch Into the Spider-verse again before watching Across the Spider-Verse this summer, but instead I did neither

- “sloop john b call my dad” – from the New York Times crossword

- “the way the moon’s in love with the dark” – an art piece from the Denver Art Museum I really, really like

- “douglas shadle“

- “clairo alewife” – from a spotify playlist with song titles from the MBTA Red Line

- “tse-whit-zen” – from my time in Seattle; they were trying to build a dock to build a new floating bridge to replace a bridge that sank, and they found the remains of a pre-European contact village instead

- “le nozze di figaro“

- “dirty laundry show“

scotusblog (11)

Every year, at some point in June, I get really into reading Supreme Court opinions and following the big decisions of the term. Mostly, I just get kind of depressed reading them, but sometimes 
        it’s fun to read dense legal text and learn things.
      


- “Supreme Court upholds Section 2 of Voting Rights Act“

- “United States, ex rel. Polansky v. Executive Health Resources, Inc.“

- “United States v. Hansen“

- “Smith v. United States“

- “Pugin v. Garland“

- “Haaland v. Brackeen“

- “Supreme Court cabins reach of aggravated identity theft statute“

- “Jack Daniel’s wins big in challenge to spoofing ‘Bad Spaniels’ dog toy“

- “United States v. Texas“

- “Biden v. Nebraska“

- “Samia v. United States“

wikipedia (25)

Over a quarter of my tabs are just Wikipedia articles I pulled up to reference once, most of which I probably no longer need, but, y’know, sometimes you just have to keep them around in case you want to come back to them.

media

- “Chronicle of a Death Foretold” – a pretty good short story I read in a Spanish class once, which I wanted to look at again; would recommend

- “La Cage aux Folles (musical)“

- “Dominic Cooper” – I’m pretty sure I only have this tab open because of Mamma Mia

seattle?

I’ve spent the past two summers in Seattle, which has some
        fascinating infrastructural history;
      
this is just what remains of a pretty intense series of searches I did one morning on the bus to work.

- “Tse-whit-zen” – as mentioned earlier

- “Mount Baker Tunnel“

- “Ballard Terminal Railroad“

- “Burke-Gilman Trail“

- “Convention Place station” – okay, okay, one more piece of trivia. Seattle’s light rail travels through a downtown tunnel that used to be shared with buses. the buses used to stop at a station called Convention Place, until eventually they cut the bus traffic and expanded the Convention Center over it, but you can still see the emergency signage for Convention Place inside the tunnel if you look carefully.

music

- “Marin Alsop” – I got to see Marin Alsop conduct the Seattle Symphony this summer! Among a number of other pieces, they played “Symphonic Dances from West Side Story,” which I got to play in high school and therefore was very excited by :)

- “Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)” – another Seattle Symphony concert! I was very impressed by this piece as well, and wanted to know more about it

- “Gurre-Lieder” – a piece I mostly know of because it “calls for exceptionally large orchestral and choral forces” (literally hundreds of musicians and singers)

computers et. al.

I could talk your ear off about most of these things, but I will restrain myself. Let’s just say that computers are very cool.

- “CPUID” – a thing that tells a computer program what the CPU it is running on can do!

- “System Management Mode“

- “AMD APU“

- “JTAG“

- “Galerkin method“

- “Baudot code” – I think this was an NYT crossword answer recently

???

- “List of military nuclear accidents” – your guess is as good as mine

- “Stephanie Herseth Sandlin” – obligatory South Dakota content

- “Tontine” – love when my investment allows me to “share the risk of living a long life” by playing “a kind of mortality lottery”

- “Pat Robertson controversies“

- “2022 Australian federal election” – something something Anthony Albanese

- “Serenity Prayer“

- “Creatine” – biological pathways go brrrr

- “Atlanta Braves” – did you know the Atlanta Braves used to be the Boston Beaneaters? this is the only reason I opened this tab

other things that computer nerds care about (6)

- “Computer Engineering for Babies” – because sometimes you just need to know what an XOR gate is

- “Arm Cortex-A Series Programmer’s Guide…Snoop Control Unit” – your computer probably has multiple CPU cores on it, and all of them have data caches which make them run faster. sometimes, though, if you have a program running on more than one core, it has to make sure those data caches are consistent! the snoop control unit is one of those things that can make this possible.

- “AEPIC Leak” – it turns out modern CPUs are very complicated and so lots of security bugs abound! they’re usually super specific so kind of hard to explain, but they are quite cool

- “Zenbleed“

- “USB Type-C and power delivery 101 – Power delivery protocol” – this is why you can now plug your USB-C laptop charger into your USB-C phone and it doesn’t explode – 
        it negotiates the voltage in advance!
      


- “I’m mystified what this ‘memory training’ even is” – RAM, the 
        place where your computer programs use memory when they are running,
      
 is one of those things in your computer that’s getting more complicated over time. it turns out the wires for modern RAM have variable timing based on all sort of conditions, and this really matters so that memory works correctly.

I don’t even know anymore (14)

- “Scott Duke Kominers“

- “FTA Safety Management Inspection Response” – because the MBTA is working on responding to some federal concerns

- “Olivia Lyrics – One Direction” – throwback

- “Shuppet (Pokemon)“

- “Drifloon (Pokemon)” – what a cute balloon ghost

- “‘S’ Series baton” – I’ve conducted two shows for the Musical Theatre Guild in the last year, and was thinking about buying a baton in June, kind of just for fun, but haven’t committed to it yet

dogg number,"Mel N. '24, MEng '25",0,2023-09-20T00:00:00-04:00,"In 2022, Snoop Dogg changed the course of human history by releasing his song “Affirmations”. Today, we honor him by calculating every Spotify artist’s “Dogg Number”.


In 2022, Snoop Dogg changed the course of human history by releasing his song “Affirmations”. Today, we honor him by calculating every Spotify artist’s “Dogg Number”.

That’s the header for our HackMIT project on the submission website.

“Affirmations” has been a running joke among my friends for the past year, mostly because when I found it, I was like…Snoop Dogg???? Nursery rhyme??? But leaning into the song and repeating the affirmations does kind of help. I’ve had many a night where I’m hunched over my computer trying to finish my work as I mumble, sounding half-dead, “I get better every single day…”

My roommates and I decided to join 
        HackMIT
      
 this year just to see what it was like. It was advertised pretty strongly to freshmen, which was why Sarah participated that year, but Rui and I had just never signed up before. We thought we’d try it out before we graduated.

Every year, the very talented HackMIT team designs merch for attendees. This year, hackers got a dark green hoodie (which I was super happy about, because I’ve really been in a green-brown-white aesthetic shift lately), some cute stickers, a bingo postcard, and a fridge magnet.

We checked in, collected our items, got breakfast, sat through the opening ceremony, and decided that we were not going to code in Johnson Ice Rink surrounded by a million other people, so we went to Rotch Library, the architecture library in 
        Lobby 7.
      


I’d actually never been before, as a frequenter of 
        Hayden and Barker,
      
 and I thought it was super nice. There was pretty much no one there since it was a Saturday morning. We started setting up — we wanted to work on a Bacon number-esque project where we calculated how many collaborations away Spotify artists were from Snoop Dogg, so we were using the Spotify API and the Spotipy library. We also wanted to visualize our networks using Pyvis. Rui and Sarah taught me how to use Github, which I’d always been so confused by in previous UROPs.

But we eventually discovered that it was quiet study hours, so we left and found ourselves in a random classroom in Building 4, trying to figure out what the heck was going on with the Spotify API. It got to a point where, in a moment of despair, I got up and wrote “CODING IS HARD!!!!!” in big letters over the thermodynamics scribbles on the board left from a previous lecture.

Since we’re all living together, being part of the same team became a lot easier, since we could just…go home and finish the rest of the project in our pajamas. We were done around 1 AM, and we submitted it to Devpost, the platform that HackMIT was using for submissions.

(We didn’t submit it for judging, because we were all very tired and didn’t feel like doing a presentation, and also it requires some wrangling to run it on your computer, but woohoo! First real coding project out there! Honestly, I’m super proud of us for coming up with this in like, a little over 12 hours.)

We slept in and ordered waffles from Zinneken’s the next day to celebrate.

climbing and becoming,Uzay G. '26,4,2023-09-16T00:00:00-04:00,"This summer, I became obsessed with climbing.

Climbing is an exercise in creativity and fitness originating from a very simply defined objective: “Get to the top of this wall, in any way possible”. This flavor of activity reminds me of the mental motions to solving a math or programming problem, where often formulating the challenge is the easy part, but getting it solved is hard.

The constraints are undefined, you get stuck, and need to think about where you’re going or what your options are. You also get afraid, and have to cope with risk and the limits of safety and your own abilities.

There are stakes. If you go to a climbing gym you’ll see all these people going up these boulders several meters up into the air. There are mats, but it’s dangerous if you fall in a bad way. But climbing gyms are still a thing; tons of people climb, and you rarely see people fall.

People are good at calibrating on the physical level of risk they’re in, such that whenever you feel you could slip or fall on your back, your body just takes over and makes you fall off before. It’s wild! And a big part of climbing is learning when that instinct is excessive, when you should subvert it to go beyond what you can do.

—

I’m stuck on the wall. There’s a foothold on my right that I could use to place my body laterally and lift my hand to another hold on the right. I feel my body getting more and more tired and a fear of slipping creeps in on me. I squirm a bit and try to place myself better, but end up just standing there, waiting for something but not really knowing what. After a bit I thud back on the ground, and stare at the wall. I’m pretty sure I had to do that move, but I am also sure if I do it I will slip or fall onto the ground and hurt myself. It doesn’t even seem within reach.

I ask a better climber next to me what to do, and he goes up onto the wall. I watch him intently as he does the exact thing I was thinking, without breaking a sweat. I tell him I’ll fall, and he smiles and tells me I won’t. And he was right.

—

A year ago I moved to the US to study at MIT, and decided not to follow the other path I was considering where I’d stay in Paris.

MIT gave me freedom to explore and grow that is hard to obtain in most places. But being ok with my decision took me many months and was hard (reach out if you feel like I did then!), and there’s this part of me that still wants to be able to stay closer to my culture and family and what I’ve always known.

When I decided to go to MIT, I tried sizing up the options, thinking about the pros and cons. I was terrified to leave home at 17 to go to this faraway place in another country, and was unsure whether it even was the right choice for me, given the solid alternatives. But I was excited, and I made that leap, or I thought I did. I actually made it half way, and kept this instinct of natural fear and uncertainty for months even at MIT, where I sometimes felt like it was time to just go back home and stop. 
        It was sometimes just really hard. 
      


It can be easier to just listen to your gut and do the safe thing even when it’s not the right thing. Building a taste for who you are and who you want to be allows you to go beyond instinct. 

Making that improvement is part of how you can jump to the next step of adulthood. I think a lot about choice, and the choices I need to make. A lot of this is overthinking, but also just me really caring about doing what feels like the right thing, even if sometimes there is no right decision, just different ones. But I think the heightened ability to make choices for your life while being forced to face the consequences is a big part of becoming an adult. And it’s hard! You want your parents to be there to tell you everything is alright, you want it to be true that you’ll be fine no matter what. But these things do matter.",,0
Fall Sports at MIT,Emiko P. '25,8,2023-09-15T00:00:00-04:00,"Hi, everyone! My name is Emiko, and I am one of the new bloggers :) I am a junior, and I play midfield on the Varsity Women’s Soccer team. I thought I’d give you guys a glimpse into the life of a student-athlete here at MIT…

When you think of competitions at MIT, the first thing that comes to mind might be math competitions, chess matches, or some form of hackathon. However, what may come as a surprise is that MIT is very, very good at a specific type of competition — athletics. 

We have 33 varsity sports teams, and a whopping 25% of students will participate in one during their time at MIT. We have won 
        NCAA
      
National Championships, the NCAA Woman of the Year (which is given to the top female student-athlete across all sports and divisions), and broken national records — and that was only last year. 

According to our athletics website, MIT student-athletes have won 62 individual national championships, 26 team championships, and lead the 
        NEWMAC
      
in conference championships. 30 alumni have participated in the Olympic Games, winning three Gold medals, and Jasmin Moghbeli, a former member of the women’s basketball, volleyball, and lacrosse teams, is currently on the International Space Station. Reading these stats for the first time was wild, but in no way was I surprised — our student-athletes are crazy talented.

Anyways, all that to say that MIT sports are pretty epic. With all this in mind, as a junior midfielder on the Women’s Soccer team, the start of the fall season has me pretty pumped. I thought I’d take the chance to talk to three fall sport student-athletes to get their take on sports at MIT and the current 2023 fall season. 

How has your experience been as a student-athlete at MIT so far? 

Field hockey student-athlete: “I really have enjoyed being a student-athlete because it is hard to find the friendships and bonds you get with your teammates anywhere else. There’s always an upperclassman to give you advice on classes or career choices.” 

Football student-athlete: “Playing a varsity sport provides time off mentally and physically from the academic day of being an MIT student. I’ve made many close friends and enjoyed continuing my passion for sports.” 

Men’s soccer student-athlete: “So far I’ve really enjoyed being an athlete at MIT because it has given me the opportunity to continue playing the sport I love while also being able to devote time and energy to academics and social life. Overall, it’s a great balance of all the things that are important to me.” 

Favorite sport-related memory? 

Field hockey student-athlete: “My favorite memory is when we traveled to Middlebury for our second-round NCAA game. It was a pretty long bus ride and we played lots of fun road trip games on the way. Even though we lost 0-8 (cry), it was so fun to go on a road trip and stay in a hotel together.”

Football student-athlete: “My favorite memory of playing football at MIT is having a perfect fall Saturday devoted to no school — just playing football and hanging out with friends and family after the game.” 

Men’s soccer student-athlete: “During freshman year, the “golden goal” rule was still in play, where if there was a tie after 90 minutes of regulation time, the first team to score in the next 30 minutes of extra time won. We had a game against Brandeis at home, which was a pretty competitive game, and after regulation time the game was tied 0-0. Late into extra time, our captain Pete scored a header to win the game, and we all chased him to the bushes behind the goal to celebrate.” 

Tips for athletes getting recruited right now? 

Field hockey student-athlete: “My recruiting process was pretty typical in terms of exchanging emails with the coach and playing at an MIT summer recruiting camp.” 

Football student-athlete: “I sent in my Hudl highlights to the head coaches, sent them emails often, and made sure my test scores were acceptable.” 

Men’s soccer student-athlete: “The recruiting process is different for everyone but definitely pretty tough for all. For recruiting at MIT, I think the most important first step is having all of the academics lined up because MIT does not offer automatic admission for athletes, and that will catch the attention of the coaches when you reach out. I would recommend doing your homework to understand the team’s style and where you would fit in.” 

What is an example of a day in your life? 

Field hockey student-athlete: “For our last game day, I woke up around 8:15 am and scooted over to my first class of the day, Dynamics and Controls II. During the 1.5 hour lecture, I ate part of my brekky. After that, I had a 
        GEL
      
 lecture where we learned about how engineering is also about being social! At 12:30, I went to the Stud with some friends and did some exploring because it was newly renovated. At 1 pm, I scooted over to Sloan for Managerial Finance, where I learned about how to calculate the future value of money. Then I scooted to the locker room and ate some pregame snacks. I changed into my uniform, packed my bag, brought my iPad to do some work on the bus, and then the bus left at 4 pm for our away game! The game was at 6 pm, and we got back to MIT at around 8:30 pm. I showered, did some Thermofluids Engineering PSETting, chatted with my roommates (aka Emiko), then went to bed.”

Football student-athlete: “On a weekday in the fall, I wake up at 9:30 am, eat a quick snack, then head to Intensive French Conversation. After that I go straight to Aerodynamics for an hour. Then I either grab Chipotle or Masseh dining during my break, after which I have Corporate Finance for 1.5 hours. Then I usually have a quick nap. I lift from 4-5 pm, have practice from 5-7 pm, and then eat dinner at my fraternity. At night I do homework that’s due the next day for my classes.” 

Men’s soccer student-athlete: “I wake up at 10 am and get ready for my Urban Energy Systems and Policy class at 11 am. After class, I grab a quick lunch at either Sloan or the Stud. Then, at 1 pm, I go to Organizational Process for Business Analytics until 2:30 pm. At home, I grab a pre-practice snack, relax a bit, roll and stretch until 4:30 pm when I head to the locker room to change. Practice is from 5-7 pm, and then I go back to the locker room to shower. I eat dinner at home at 7:30 pm, work until 1 am, then sleep!”

Something you are excited about for this season?

Field hockey player: “My bestie’s birthday is soon, so I am excited to plan something good for this year. Last year she received a cake with an image of her own foot with an iPhone charger woven through the toes.”

Football player: “I am looking forward to the season because I will be an upperclassman and I will get to lead and teach my younger teammates on and off the field.”

Men’s soccer player: “With the soccer team, I feel like each class we recruit is more excited about the program than the last, so I’m super excited to incorporate all of the new guys into the team. As a leader in the program now, I’m excited to be able to leverage my experience to help them get comfortable and then make an impact. I have high hopes for the success of the team.”

So far, it’s been a blast. Although I got injured early during 
        preseason
      
 (fractured my foot in a nasty tackle at our Harvard scrimmage, oof), it was still so fun. There’s nothing else like bonding with my team, shivering in ice baths together, scoring a banger goal, and feeling the chemistry turn on. Preseason was a time of outrageous tan lines (I have a permanent razorback tan on my back now), of music blasting on Roberts Field, of sunsets at practice. It almost felt like summer camp as we all piled into New Vassar dining for lunch, each team welcoming its new first-years and catching up with the friends they hadn’t seen all summer. 

Shout out to: Women’s Soccer, Men’s Soccer, Field Hockey, Women’s Volleyball, Football, Water Polo, Cross Country, Women’s Tennis, Men’s Tennis, Crew, and Sailing! 

It’s time for fall sports.

Strands,Shorna A. '25,0,2023-09-10T00:00:00-04:00,"a/n: this post is a little outdated – my hair is currently a faded blue.

I recently got my hair re-dyed. My mother usually insists that I get my haircut at an actual salon, since she thinks that if I bleach and dye my own hair I’ll ruin it (which, mind you, I have never done, despite having bleached it myself repeatedly!). I forgot to bring my book along with me to the drying apparatus, so while my hair was gently warmed, I inspected the snips of mint green hair that had settled on my black apron and ruminated. Hair salons in particular are very good for this type of calm consideration. They have a really lovely ambiance, with hairdressers happily babbling about mundane (but riveting) gossip and some 2000’s track playing quietly in the background, periodically interrupted by the dull roar of a hair dryer. 

I walked into the store with overgrown, faded, green hair that was in dire need of a trim. My stylist asked me how long I had been dying my hair, and I faltered for a moment, realizing that my knee-jerk answer – a couple of years – wasn’t true any more. She looked at me slightly expectantly, and I finally answered – “Six years… since I was a freshman in high school.” I’m a classic case of falling down the slippery slope. I started with dark brown highlights, and the next thing I knew, half of my shirts had blue stains on the collar. I’m actually a little reckless with my hair, all things considered. It’s been bleached three times, I let Athena hack off some curtain bangs during my freshman IAP, and I’m bad at remembering to condition it. After I left home I started letting it air dry (my mother was no longer around to nag me about catching a cold), and it’s usually in a state of disarray, since I often can’t be bothered to brush it. As I fingered the juncture between the cool metal and black leather of my salon chair, it occurred to me that my lack of care for my hair was pretty ironic, since my hair is incredibly precious to me. 

To be honest, my hair has always been a source of pride. Or at least, comfort. I would never have described myself as pretty in middle or high school, but my hair was always thick, pin-straight, and enviably shiny. It was one of the few ways in which I felt like I was able to fulfill the beauty standards of my Arkansan childhood. For the first 14 years of my life, I simply refused to ever wear it up, because I felt like putting it up got rid of the only thing that made me bearable to look at. That sounds a bit melodramatic, but it used to feel true. I actually still have a lot of trouble with this. Every few weeks, I force myself to put it in a ponytail. I’ll stare in the mirror for a moment, realize how dissatisfied I am with my appearance, let out a sigh of disgust, and pull the tie out of my hair. I’m sometimes a minute or two late to class because of these mini-crises. I’m not nearly as self conscious as I used to be – I actually consider myself reasonably conventionally attractive, now – but I just can’t seem to get over the thing with my hair. 

My nervous reflex involves running my hand through my hair, a-la a teenage fuck boy. I’ve repeatedly debated cutting all of my hair off, if only because I know I depend on it too much as an emotional crutch. Whenever I bring up the idea to friends there’s always the same sentiment – you have such nice hair, though, Shorna. It’s an incredibly sweet compliment, but I’m not sure I like needing my hair as much as I do, because I’m deeply aware of how much power my hair has over me.

When I was a junior in high school, I was a bit high strung. That’s… an understatement. I was always very close to crying (although I would’ve rather died than do it in front of someone else) and I had almost no emotional outlet for my ever-growing anxiety about college applications. I was terrified of squandering my potential, burning out too early, being unable to make good on all of the dreams I had chosen for myself. I was so incredibly stressed, all of the time. Halfway through the fall of my junior year, I was sitting at the dining table, reading Campbell’s Biology, when I mindlessly ran my hand through my hair and my fingers ran over a smooth circle of skin on the left side of my head. With a jolt, I realized a quarter-sized patch of hair on my head had just… disappeared. 

I was overwhelmed by nausea and rising disbelief. I hadn’t recognized how much my hair mattered to me until it fell out. I felt so exposed, as if I had, in one fell swoop, been robbed of everything that made me effeminate and desirable. My hair was the only pretty thing about me – I couldn’t even depend on that.

It was an awful feeling, but I got over it. I recognized the fact that my hair falling out was my body aching for reprieve from the immense mental pressure I was placing on myself. I tried hard to calm down, if only because I really didn’t want more of it to fall out. It worked, at least a little bit. As my hair slowly grew back, I struggled to divorce my conception of my own beauty from my hair, while simultaneously trying to separate my academic success from my sense of self-worth. I was somewhat successful, but losing my hair was a huge sore spot for more than a year. When I went for my next biannual haircut, the stylist grasped the patch of shorter-than-normal hair and raised an eyebrow, smiling at me. “It fell out. Stress, I guess.” I grimaced, slightly sheepish. Her smile faltered a little. She let out an “ah” and shuffled it back into the rest of my hair. 

My hair has been red, pink, purple, blue, various shades of brown and blonde, and (most recently) green. I kept doing the things I had always done once it fully grew back, cutting and coloring with abandon. Despite the complicated nature of my relationship with it, my hair is important to me, so I think it ought to reflect who I am. It does feel right to look in the mirror to find my hair the color of paint fresh from the tube. I asked my stylist last Saturday to turn the ends a silvery-blue, but she cautioned me – “You have such nice hair, I don’t want to damage it. Let’s do something darker.” I smiled and accepted her proposal of a dark bluish-purple instead. As she wrapped up, running a dollop of gel through my bangs and unbuttoning the cape from my neck, I couldn’t help flushing giddily as her coworker let out an appreciative ‘ooh’ and told me I had ‘model hair’. She was probably exaggerating, but my hair is pretty, and very purple, and probably a lot more important to me than it should be. I don’t have a clean moral. It’s hard to care so much about something that feels both blatantly frivolous and deeply fundamental to your identity. My fingernails will be stained indigo for the next few weeks, so, after every shower, while I attempt to scrub them back to the correct color, I’ll try to remember that I can care about my hair without it affecting my self-worth. We’ll see how that goes.",,0
walking into the MEng,"Alan Z. '23, MEng '24",5,2023-09-08T00:00:00-04:00,"This past Sunday, at 4 AM on the side of U.S. Highway 1 on Badger’s Island in Maine, along with Nathan S. ’25 and Jonathan H. ’25, I took my first steps on a 63-mile walk from Maine to Next House, an Odyssey which would take us 22.5 hours, crossing
        three states
      
 and stopping at least five McDonald’s; a tragedy that would cost us 125,000 steps and probably gallons of water, during which 
        we lost Jonathan at mile 32 to some hip flexor concerns
      
as well as our collective sanity. We trekked down trails and up the sides of roads, through the heat of the mid-afternoon to the darkness of Highway 1 in the evening, until, finally, at 2:50 AM, we stumbled through the doors of Next House, limping, barely able to continue walking. It took me two or three days just to be able to walk normally again.

There are lots of things I could tell you about this walk. I could tell you that this walk reminded me of the power of perseverance; that, a lot of the times, when it plays out in real life, the story of the tortoise and the hare is more about the tortoise’s ability to keep going rather than the hare’s perceived laziness. I could tell you that getting through MIT is like that—the journey is long, and it’s not about going as fast as you can, but instead making it as far as you can. It’s about building up the stamina and mental capacity and just plodding your way down the side of the highway, one step after another.

I could also tell you that the walk taught me the importance of “knowing your limits” and “listening to your body”; that we should’ve quit at mile 54 when things started hurting and the project became much less interesting, that suffering just to say you’ve done something is almost never worth it. I could tell you that you need to engineer escape plans which you know you will take, because your decision-making skills are weakest exactly when you are tired and under stress, that is, when you need to make the decision to quit. I could also tell you that getting through MIT is like this—it’s very easy to see something interesting, decide to do it, and then refuse to quit even though it’s no longer fun and it’s hurting your ability to actually enjoy your college experience at all.

Those stories are important, but, in a sense, they’re both oversold—the truth, I think, is unsatisfying: the balance between perseverance and self-care is one that we need to find for ourselves, a kind of an Aristotelian mean which we are always seeking, a question to which there is no right answer except the one which allows you to achieve 
        fulfillment.
      
 Sometimes, it is possible to just keep pushing through and have it turn out great; other times, you would’ve been much better off taking a break, or dropping a class, or quitting that activity you don’t put enough time into anyway. The answer, as it often is, is that two things can be true at once.

So, instead, let’s rewind a bit.

As you may know, I graduated from the Institute last spring, with an 
        SB
      
 in Writing and Computer Science and Engineering. I’m back now, writing as I pursue a 
        MEng in computer science,
      
which means I’m now a 
        graduate student.
      


And it’s different, and it’s the same. I’m living in a graduate dorm now, which is still a dorm, but I have my own bedroom
        for the first time in years.
      
 I’m a graduate teaching assistant now, but many of my responsibilities are the same ones I did as an undergraduate lab assistant—staffing office hours, giving lab check-offs, etc.. I’m trying to navigate this weird, liminal space where I feel like I am neither a true graduate student nor a true undergraduate student—in other words, a moment of transition.

Where does this walk fit into all that?

In many ways, this walk felt like the last gasp of undergrad for me. So much of my undergraduate experience was defined by proving myself to nobody in particular—proving I could do anything and everything, doing dumb, insane things just for the hell of it. I need to finish these 63 miles because then I will be able to say that I am capable of doing it, just like I used to say I need to take all these classes because then I will have learned so much more about all the things I want to know about. This is not to say that I regret how I spent my undergrad, but rather that it is a modality of living which is slowly coming to an end, and this felt like one last manifestation of that spontaneous, do-it-all lifestyle.

But this was also the first time in years where I had the time and energy for a project like this, especially in the week between 
        REX
      
 and the first day of classes. I’ve always been so busy, running from activity to activity, or, during the semester, living from problem set to problem set, that I never really got to slow down and focus on any one thing. In this sense, the walk felt like graduate school: narrowing my life down to specific, larger projects which have particular meaning—research, TAing, etc.—instead of doing six classes and a dozen activities. I wanted to go on a long walk, and so I dedicated a day to preparing for it, a day to doing it, and a day to recovering from it, and everything was good.

And, honestly, that narrowing is exciting to me. I am excited to see what is possible when I actually get to put more time into fewer baskets, what is possible when I get to take a little more time to recover from things and celebrate small victories, instead of moving on to the next battle. If the walk is anything to judge by, it’ll be fun, chaotic, intentional, maybe a little difficult and painful, but it just might be good yet. It will be finally choosing depth over breadth, as I prune the tree of possible paths towards some future, and, for the first time in my life, I feel ready to do that.

So, the walk was a great idea, or maybe the walk was a terrible idea, and maybe it was a good time, and maybe it was a bad time, but whatever it was, it felt like part of this turning point, from the past to the future, from undergrad to grad, from the widening to the narrowing, and that was good.

So, we’ll see. Maybe these thoughts are just a kind of start-of-term optimism, which is always abundant, or maybe this MEng will be a genuine turning point in my relationship with work, its depth and breadth, and what I want to do next. I’ve got a few semesters left to find out.","https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/PXL_20230903_080520544-800x602.jpg
